Who's screened for AAA,"In England, screening for AAA is offered to men during the year they turn 65.
Men aged 65 or over are most at risk of getting AAAs. Screening can help spot a swelling in the aorta early on when it can usually be treated.
Screening for AAA is not routinely offered to:
women
men under 65
people who have already been treated for an AAA
This is because the risk of getting an AAA is much smaller in these groups.
If you're over 65 years old, you can ask for a scan to check for an AAA if you think you might need one but have not been offered a screening test."
How to get screened for AAA,"If you're a man and registered with a GP, you'll get a screening invitation in the post when you're 64 or soon after your 65th birthday. You can then arrange an appointment that suits you.
If you're a man over 65 and have not been screened before, you can ask for a test by contacting your local AAA screening service directly."
Benefits of AAA screening,"An AAA will often cause few or no obvious symptoms, but if it's left to get bigger, it could burst and cause life-threatening bleeding inside your tummy.
About 8 in every 10 people who have a burst AAA die before they get to hospital or do not survive emergency surgery to repair it.
Screening can pick up an AAA before it bursts. If an AAA is found, you can choose to have regular scans to monitor it or surgery to stop it bursting.
The screening test is very quick, painless and reliable. Research suggests it can halve the risk of dying from an AAA."
Deciding to be screened,"It's up to you to decide if you want to be screened for AAA.
While there are clear benefits of screening, you should also consider the possible risks.
There's no risk from the screening test itself, but there's a risk of:
anxiety from being told you have a potentially life-threatening condition
serious complications of surgery carried out to treat an AAA
Call your local screening service and ask to be removed from its list if you do not want to be screened."
What happens during AAA screening,"Screening for AAA involves a quick and painless ultrasound scan of your tummy.
This is similar to the scan pregnant women have to check on their baby.
When you arrive for your appointment, a screening technician will check your details, explain the scan and ask if you have any questions.
For the scan:
you lie down on a table and lift up or unbutton your top (you do not need to undress)
the technician rubs a clear gel on your tummy and moves a small handheld scanner over your skin – pictures from the scanner are shown on a monitor and the technician will measure how wide your aorta is
the gel is wiped away and you pull down or button up your top
the technician tells you the result straight away
The whole test usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
Sometimes the technician might not be able to see your aorta clearly. This is not anything to worry about.
If this happens, you'll be asked to have another scan, usually on a different day."
Results of AAA screening,"You'll be told your result at the end of the test. 
If a problem is found, you'll also be a sent letter confirming the result and letting you know what happens next.
There are 4 possible screening results.
No aneurysm found
If your aorta is less than 3cm wide, this means it's not enlarged. Most men have this result.
You will not need to have any treatment or monitoring afterwards, and will not be invited for AAA screening again.
Small AAA
If you have a small AAA, this means your aorta measures 3cm to 4.4cm across.
Just over 1% of men screened have a small AAA.
You will not need any treatment at this stage as the chance of the AAA bursting is small.
You'll be invited back for a scan every year to check its size.
Treatment will usually only be needed if it becomes a large AAA.
You'll also be given advice on how you can stop an AAA getting bigger, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly.
Medium AAA
If you have a medium AAA, this means your aorta measures 4.5cm to 5.4cm across.
About 0.5% of men screened have a medium AAA.
You will not need any treatment at this stage as the chance of the AAA bursting is small.
You'll be invited back for a scan every 3 months to check its size.
Treatment will usually only be needed if it becomes a large AAA.
You'll also be given advice on how you can stop an AAA getting bigger, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly.
Large AAA
If you have a large AAA, this means your aorta measures 5.5cm or more across.
About 0.1% of men screened have a large AAA.
As large AAAs have the highest risk of bursting if left untreated, you'll be referred to a specialist surgeon within 2 weeks to talk about your treatment options.
Most men with a large AAA are advised to have surgery to stop it getting bigger or bursting.
While surgery carries a risk of serious complications, this is generally smaller than the risk of not treating a large AAA."

Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm often has no symptoms.
You usually only find out you have one during an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening test or during tests for another condition.
If an aneurysm gets bigger, you might sometimes notice:
tummy or back pain
a pulsing feeling in your tummy"
Tests for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"The main test to find out if you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an ultrasound scan of your tummy.
A small device is placed on your tummy and images of the inside of your tummy will be shown on a screen.
You'll usually be told if you have an aneurysm at the end of the test.
You’ll also be told how big it is:
small (3cm to 4.4cm or smaller)
medium (4.5cm to 5.4cm)
large (5.5cm or bigger)
Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm
An ultrasound test is offered to all men when they turn 65, as they're most at risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
This is called abdominal aortic aneurysm screening."
Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm usually depends on how big it is and if you have symptoms.
If it's small, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating healthily may be recommended to help stop it getting bigger.
Sometimes you may need:
medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger
surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful
Surgery has risks and side effects which your doctor or surgeon should discuss with you.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often get bigger over time. You'll usually need regular scans to see if it's getting bigger.
If your aneurysm ruptures, you’ll need emergency surgery to treat it."
How to lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Making healthy lifestyle changes can help lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or stop one from getting bigger.
Do
eat healthily
exercise regularly
try to lose weight if you're overweight
try to cut down on alcohol
Don’t
do not smoke"
Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened.
It's not always clear what causes it, but some people have a higher chance of getting one.
You’re more at risk if you:
are male and aged 65 or over
smoke or used to smoke
have high blood pressure
have high cholesterol
have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm
have coronary or peripheral artery disease (atherosclerosis)
have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
have a condition such as Marfan syndrome
Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection, but this is rare."
How to get an abortion,"Abortions can only be carried out under the care of an NHS hospital or a licensed clinic, and are usually available free of charge on the NHS.
If you're less than 10 weeks pregnant you may be able to have a medical abortion at home after an initial appointment with the hospital or clinic.
There are 3 main ways to get an abortion on the NHS:
you can self-refer by contacting an abortion provider directly – the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), MSI Reproductive Choices UK, the National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (NUPAS) or your local NHS sexual health website can tell you about eligibility and services in your area
speak to a GP and ask for a referral to an abortion service – the GP should refer you to another doctor if he or she has any objections to abortion
contact a sexual health clinic (sometimes called family planning or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics) and ask for a referral to an abortion service
Waiting times can vary, but you should not have to wait more than 2 weeks from when you (or a doctor) first contact an abortion provider to having an abortion.
You can also pay for an abortion privately (not on the NHS) if you prefer. Costs for private abortions vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method used to carry out the procedure."
When an abortion can be carried out,"Most abortions in England, Wales and Scotland are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
They can be carried out after 24 weeks in very limited circumstances – for example, if the mother's life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability.
Most abortion services will ask to perform an ultrasound scan to work out how many weeks pregnant you are. The length of pregnancy is calculated from the first day of your last period.
Abortions are safer the earlier they're carried out. Getting advice early on will give you more time to make a decision if you're unsure."
Deciding to have an abortion,"The decision to have an abortion is yours alone.
Some women may be certain they want to have an abortion, while others may find it more difficult to make a decision.
All women requesting an abortion can discuss their options with, and receive support from, a trained pregnancy counsellor if they wish.
Impartial information and support are available from:
your GP or another doctor at your GP practice
a counselling service at the abortion clinic
organisations such as Brook (for under-25s), BPAS, MSI Reproductive Choices UK and NUPAS
You may also want to speak to your partner, friends or family, but you do not have to. They do not have a say in your decision.
If you do not want to tell anyone, your details will be kept confidential.
If you're under 16, your parents do not usually need to be told. The doctor or nurse may encourage you to tell a parent, carer or other adult you trust, but they will not make you.
There are organisations, usually known as crisis pregnancy centres, that offer counselling around pregnancy. They do not refer people for abortion, and may not offer balanced or accurate advice.
If you go to a place that offers pregnancy counselling and you're not sure if they will refer you for an abortion, ask if they refer people for an abortion."
What happens during an abortion,"Before having an abortion, you'll have an appointment to talk about your decision and what happens next.
Whenever possible, you should be given a choice of how you would like the abortion to be carried out.
There are 2 options:
medical abortion (""abortion pill"") – you take 2 medicines, usually 24 to 48 hours apart, to induce an abortion
surgical abortion – you have a procedure to remove the pregnancy and normally go home soon afterwards
After an abortion, you'll probably need to take things easy for a few days. It's likely you'll have some discomfort and vaginal bleeding for up to 2 weeks.
Read more about how an abortion is carried out."
Risks of an abortion,"Abortion is a safe procedure. Abortions are safest, and happen with less pain and bleeding, when carried out as early as possible in pregnancy.
Most women will not experience any problems, but there is a small risk of complications, such as:
infection of the womb (uterus)
some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb
excessive bleeding
damage to the womb or entrance of the womb (cervix)
If complications do occur, you may need further treatment, including surgery.
Having an abortion will not affect your chances of becoming pregnant again and having normal pregnancies in the future.
You may be able to get pregnant immediately after an abortion. You should use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant.
Read more about the risks of abortion."
Check if you have acanthosis nigricans,"The main symptom of acanthosis nigricans is patches of skin that are darker and thicker than usual.
They can appear anywhere on the body.
The patches are dry and feel similar to velvet.
Credit:
They're most common in skin folds, such as the armpits, neck or groin.
Credit:
Some people also have tiny growths (skin tags) on the patches.
Credit:
The patches often appear gradually without any other symptoms.
Sometimes the skin may be itchy."
Causes of acanthosis nigricans,"The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is being very overweight.
Other causes include:
type 2 diabetes
conditions that affect hormone levels – such as Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid
taking certain medicines – including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill
rarely, cancer – usually stomach cancer
rarely, a faulty gene inherited from your parents
Sometimes healthy people with no other conditions get acanthosis nigricans. This is more common in people with black or brown skin."
Treating acanthosis nigricans,"Once a GP knows what's causing acanthosis nigricans, they can recommend the best treatment.
The patches should fade over time once the cause is treated.
If you're very overweight, a GP may recommend losing weight.
Depending on the cause, they may also recommend:
medicine to balance your hormones
medicine to balance your insulin levels
changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches
There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first."
Symptoms of achalasia,"Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms.
But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible.
Other symptoms include:
bringing back up undigested food
choking and coughing fits
heartburn
chest pain
repeated chest infections
drooling of vomit or saliva
gradual but significant weight loss
Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life.
Swallowing problems can also be caused by cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. There’s a link between long-term achalasia and the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus, but the risk is small.
It’s always important to get symptoms checked straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you."
Causes of achalasia,"Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly, which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown.
In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs.
In rare cases, it's possible that achalasia is caused by a faulty gene."
Diagnosing achalasia,"If a GP thinks you have achalasia, you'll be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests. Achalasia may also be diagnosed during an investigation, such as a chest X-ray, for another reason.
The tests for achalasia include:
manometry – a small plastic tube is passed through your mouth or nose into your oesophagus to measure the muscle pressure along it at different points.
barium swallow – you drink a white liquid containing the chemical barium and X-rays are taken. The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach.
endoscopy – a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach."
Treatments for achalasia,"There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier.
Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.
Medicine
Medicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine, can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone.
The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time.
Stretching the muscle (balloon dilation)
Under a sedative, or sometimes a general anaesthetic, a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube (endoscope). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach.
This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.
Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery.
Botox injection
Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax.
It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.
Surgery
Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and is called Heller's myotomy.
It can permanently make swallowing easier.
Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn, which can be a side effect of the Heller's myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this and any other surgical options which may be the best option for you.
Follow-up treatment
Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely.
It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment.
You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.

Immediate first aid,"After calling 999, to help prevent severe injuries from a chemical burn:
try to carefully remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing
rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible
Remove the chemical and affected clothing
try to remove the chemical and contaminated clothing from contact with the skin and eyes, but be very careful not to touch or spread the chemical
use gloves or other protective materials to cover hands and, if possible, carefully cut away clothing such as T-shirts, rather than pulling them off over the head
do not wipe the skin as this may spread contamination
if the chemical is dry, brush it off the skin
Rinse continuously with clean water
rinse the affected area continuously with clean water as soon as possible
try to make sure the water can run off the affected area without pooling on the skin
only use water – do not rub or wipe the area
Stay on the phone until the ambulance arrives and follow any other advice given by the 999 call handler to avoid further injury."
Treatment in hospital,"Immediate treatment for chemical burns in hospital includes:
continuing to wash off the corrosive substance with water until it's completely removed
cleaning the burn and covering it with an appropriate dressing
pain relief
a tetanus jab if necessary"
Recovering from a chemical burn,"Minor burns
Minor burns affecting the outer layer of skin and some of the underlying layer of tissue normally heal with good ongoing burn care, leaving minimal scarring.
Your dressing will need to be checked and changed regularly until the burn has completely healed to help prevent infection.
Severe burns
If the burn is severe, you may be referred to a specialist burns unit, which may be in a different hospital. You may stay in hospital for a number of days.
You may need surgery to remove the burnt area of skin and replace it with a section of skin (a graft) taken from another part of your body. See plastic surgery techniques for more information.
More severe and deeper burns can take months or even years to fully heal and usually leave some visible scarring. In some cases, the depth and location of the burn may also lead to problems such as sight loss or restricted use of limbs or muscles.
Specialist support
Specialist burns teams include occupational therapists, physiotherapists and mental health professionals who can support your recovery. For chemical burns affecting the eyes, you're also likely to be urgently assessed by an eye specialist to help minimise the risk of lasting vision loss.
If you've been the victim of an attack and continue to feel upset, anxious or afraid several days after the incident, you can ask to be referred to the hospital's mental health liaison team for support and treatment. Anyone with an existing mental health problem who has suffered an attack should also be referred to this team.
Burns support groups also provide practical and emotional support to victims and their families. Your care team should be able to signpost you to local groups, and the following national organisations can also help:
Changing Faces provides support for people whose condition or injury affects their appearance
Victim Support provides help and advice to victims and witnesses of crimes
Katie Piper Foundation provides specific help for victims and families of acid attacks and other burns"
Check if your baby has reflux,"Reflux usually starts before a baby is 8 weeks old and gets better by the time they're 1.
Symptoms of reflux in babies include:
bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding
coughing or hiccupping when feeding
being unsettled during feeding
swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding
crying and not settling
not gaining weight as they're not keeping enough food down
Sometimes babies may have signs of reflux but will not bring up milk or be sick. This is known as silent reflux."
Things you can try to ease reflux in babies,"Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have reflux, as long as they're happy, healthy and gaining weight.
Do
ask a health visitor for advice and support
get advice about your baby's breastfeeding position or how to bottle feed your baby
hold your baby upright during feeding and for as long as possible after feeding
burp your baby regularly during feeds
give formula-fed babies smaller feeds more often
make sure your baby sleeps flat on their back (they should not sleep on their side or front)
Don’t
do not change your diet if you're breastfeeding
do not raise the head of their cot or Moses basket"
Treatment for reflux in babies,"A GP or specialist may sometimes recommend treatments for reflux.
If your baby is formula-fed, you may be given:
a powder that's mixed with formula to thicken it
a pre-thickened formula milk
If the thickening powder does not help or your baby is breastfed, a GP or specialist might recommend medicines that stop your baby's stomach producing as much acid.
Very rarely, surgery might be needed to strengthen the muscles to stop food or milk travelling back up. This is usually only after trying other things or if their reflux is severe."
Causes of reflux,"Reflux usually happens because your baby's food pipe (oesophagus) has not fully developed, so milk can come back up easily.
Your baby's oesophagus will develop as they get older and the reflux should stop."
Symptoms of acne,"Acne most commonly develops on the:
face – this affects almost everyone with acne
back – this affects more than half of people with acne
chest – this affects about 15% of people with acne
Credit:
Types of spots
There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne:
blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces colour
whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and will not empty when squeezed
papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore
pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus
nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful
cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring"
Things you can try if you have acne,"These self-help techniques may be useful:
Do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse.
Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.
Do not try to ""clean out"" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring.
Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin.
Completely remove make-up before going to bed.
If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based emollient.
Regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne.
Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face.
Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment.
If you develop mild acne, it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice.
Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies.
Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing.
If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription."
When to seek medical advice,"If you have mild acne, speak to a pharmacist about medicines to treat it.
If these do not control your acne, or it's making you feel very unhappy, see a GP.
You should see a GP if you have moderate or severe acne or you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. 
Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.
Treatments can take several months to work, so do not expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good."
Why do I have acne?,"Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.
Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).
This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.
The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.
Other possible causes
Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.
Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.
There's no evidence that poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne."
Who's affected?,"Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent.
Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19.
Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older.
Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s.
In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35."
Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma,"An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.
Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include:
hearing loss that usually only affects 1 ear
hearing sounds that come from inside the body (tinnitus)
the sensation that you're moving or spinning (vertigo)
A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause:
persistent headaches
temporary blurred or double vision
numbness, pain or weakness on 1 side of the face
problems with limb co-ordination (ataxia) on 1 side of the body
voice changes or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)"
Getting medical advice,"See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma.
Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease.
If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as:
hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves
an MRI scan, which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head
a CT scan, which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head"
Treatments for acoustic neuromas,"There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health.
The main options are:
monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger
brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger
stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger
All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or an inability to move part of your face (paralysis).
Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are."
Outlook for acoustic neuromas,"Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus).
But it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big.
Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and drive.
These problems may need additional treatment.
Read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus.
An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal.
You'll probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back."
Symptoms of acromegaly,"Acromegaly can cause a wide range of symptoms, which tend to develop very slowly over time.
Early symptoms include:
swollen hands and feet – you may notice a change in your ring or shoe size
tiredness and difficulty sleeping, and sometimes sleep apnoea
gradual changes in your facial features, such as your brow, lower jaw and nose getting larger, or your teeth becoming more widely spaced
numbness and weakness in your hands, caused by a compressed nerve (carpal tunnel syndrome)
Children and teenagers will be abnormally tall.
As time goes on, common symptoms include:
abnormally large hands and feet
large, prominent facial features (such as the nose and lips) and an enlarged tongue
skin changes – such as thick, coarse, oily skin, skin tags, or sweating too much
deepening of the voice as a result of enlarged sinuses and vocal cords
joint pain
tiredness and weakness
headaches
blurred or reduced vision
loss of sex drive
abnormal periods (in women) and erection problems (in men)
Symptoms often become more noticeable as you get older.
See a GP straight away if you think you have acromegaly.
Acromegaly can usually be successfully treated, but early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent the symptoms getting worse and reduce the chance of complications."
Risks of acromegaly,"If you do not get treatment, you may be at risk of developing:
type 2 diabetes
high blood pressure (hypertension)
heart disease
disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
arthritis
bowel polyps, which can potentially turn into bowel cancer if left untreated
Because of the risk of bowel polyps, a procedure known as a colonoscopy might be recommended if you've been diagnosed with acromegaly. Regular colonoscopy screening may also be necessary."
Causes of acromegaly,"Acromegaly happens because your pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland just below the brain) produces too much growth hormone.
This is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour in the pituitary gland called an adenoma.
Most of the symptoms of acromegaly are due to the excess of growth hormone itself, but some come from the tumour pressing on nearby tissues. For example, you may get headaches and vision problems if a tumour pushes against the nearby nerves.
Acromegaly sometimes runs in families, but most of the time it's not inherited. Adenomas usually spontaneously develop because of a genetic change in a cell of the pituitary gland. This change causes uncontrolled growth of the affected cells, creating the tumour.
Rarely, acromegaly is caused by a tumour in another part of the body, such as the lungs, pancreas or another part of the brain. It may also be linked to some genetic conditions."
Treating acromegaly,"Treatment for acromegaly depends on your symptoms. Usually the goal is to:
reduce growth hormone production to normal levels
relieve the pressure a tumour may be putting on surrounding tissues
treat any hormone deficiencies
improve your symptoms
Most people with acromegaly have surgery to remove a pituitary tumour. Medicine or radiotherapy may sometimes be needed after, or instead of, surgery.
Surgery
Surgery is usually effective and can completely cure acromegaly. But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy.
Under general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland.
A long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an endoscope, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour. Surgical instruments are passed through the same opening and used to remove the tumour.
Removing the tumour should instantly lower your levels of growth hormone and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Facial features often start to return to normal and swelling improves within a few days.
With surgery, there's risk of:
damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland
leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain
meningitis – although this is rare
Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have.
Medicine
Medicine may be prescribed if your growth hormone levels are still higher than normal after surgery, or if surgery was not possible.
3 different types of medicine are used:
a monthly injection of either octreotide, lanreotide or pasireotide – this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours
a daily pegvisomant injection – this blocks the effects of growth hormone and can significantly improve symptoms
bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets – these can stop growth hormone being produced, but they only work in a small proportion of people
Each of these medicines has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each.
Radiotherapy
If surgery is not possible, or not all of the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered radiotherapy.
This can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime.
2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly:
stereotactic radiotherapy – a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you'll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session
conventional radiotherapy – this also uses a beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it's wider and less precise than the one used in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it's given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to give your tissues time to heal between treatments
Stereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility.
Your doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects.
Follow-up
Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly.
After treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you're on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return."
Diagnosing acromegaly,"Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away. Your doctor may ask you to bring in photographs of yourself that span the past few years to look for the tell-tale gradual changes.
Blood tests
If your doctor suspects you have acromegaly, you'll need to have a blood test to measure your growth hormone levels.
To make sure the blood test gives an accurate result, you may be asked to drink a sugary solution before having a series of blood samples taken. For people without acromegaly, drinking the solution should stop growth hormone being released. In people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain high. This is called a glucose tolerance test.
Your doctor will also measure the level of another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A higher level of IGF-1 is a very accurate indication that you may have acromegaly.
Brain scans
If your blood tests show a high level of growth hormone and IGF-1, you might have an MRI scan of your brain. This will show where the adenoma is in your pituitary gland and how big it is. If you cannot have an MRI scan, a CT scan can be carried out, but this is less accurate."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have acromegaly, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to treat and prevent acromegaly. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Check if you have actinic keratoses,"Actinic keratoses patches:
can feel dry, rough and scaly, or like sandpaper
are usually between 1cm and 2cm in size
can be the same colour as your skin, or range from pink to red to brown
may be itchy
Credit:
The patches usually appear on areas of your body that are often exposed to the sun, such as your face, hands and arms, ears, scalp and legs."
Treatment for actinic keratoses,"If you only have 1 actinic keratoses patch, a GP might suggest waiting to see if it goes away by itself.
If you have more than 1 patch, or a patch is causing you problems such as pain and itchiness, treatment is usually recommended.
A GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).
Treatments for actinic keratoses include:
prescription creams and gels
freezing the patches (cryotherapy) – this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks
surgery to cut out or scrape away the patches – you'll be given a local anaesthetic first, so it does not hurt
photodynamic therapy (PDT), where special cream is applied to the patches and a light is shone on them"
Things you can do if you have actinic keratoses,"There are things you can do to stop your actinic keratoses patches getting worse and lower your chances of developing skin cancer.
Do
check your skin regularly for any changes
use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 before going out in the sun and reapply regularly
wear a hat and clothing that fully covers your arms and legs when you're out in the sun
Don’t
do not sunbathe
do not use sunlamps or sunbeds as these can also damage your skin
do not go into the sun between 11am and 3pm – this is when the sun is at its strongest
Information:
Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if you always cover up outdoors. This is because you may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight."
How you get actinomycosis,"The bacteria that cause actinomycosis normally live harmlessly in the body. They only cause an infection if they get into the lining of areas such as the mouth or gut.
You cannot spread the infection to other people.
Any part of the body can be infected, but the head and neck, chest, tummy and pelvis are most commonly affected.
Possible causes of actinomycosis include:
tooth decay and mouth infections
mouth injuries
inhaling food or liquid
intrauterine devices (IUDs)
dental or tummy surgery
radiotherapy
You're more likely to get actinomycosis if you have type 2 diabetes or a weakened immune system."
Symptoms of actinomycosis,"Symptoms of actinomycosis depend on what part of the body is affected.
Actinomycosis symptoms in different areas of the body
Area of the body Symptoms
Jaw or mouth
Lumps in your cheek or neck, difficulty chewing, pus leaking from your skin
Lungs
Shortness of breath, chest pain, a cough, pus leaking from the skin on your chest
Tummy
Diarrhoea or constipation, pain, a lump or swelling in your tummy, pus leaking from the skin on your tummy
Pelvis
Pain low down in your tummy, vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge, a lump or swelling in your lower tummy"
Treatment for actinomycosis,"Actinomycosis is treated with antibiotics. Treatment starts off in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).
When you're well enough to go home, you'll be given antibiotic tablets to take for a few months.
It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better.
You might also need surgery to drain areas of pus (abscesses) and remove the surrounding area of skin if it's infected."
How to prevent actinomycosis,"Actinomycosis is very rare, so the chances of getting it are extremely small.
You can help reduce your risk by looking after your teeth and gums."
How acupuncture works,"Western medical acupuncture (dry needling) is the use of acupuncture following a medical diagnosis. It involves stimulating sensory nerves under the skin and in the muscles.
This results in the body producing natural substances, such as pain-relieving endorphins. It's likely that these naturally released substances are responsible for the beneficial effects experienced with acupuncture.
A course of acupuncture is usually recommended because it can take a few sessions for you to see improvements.
Traditional acupuncture is based on the belief that an energy, or ""life force"", flows through the body in channels called meridians. This life force is known as Qi (pronounced ""chee"").
Practitioners who use acupuncture in the traditional way believe that when Qi does not flow freely through the body, this can cause illness. They also believe acupuncture can restore the flow of Qi, and so restore health."
Uses of acupuncture,"Acupuncture practitioners – sometimes called acupuncturists – use acupuncture to treat a wide range of health conditions. However, the use of acupuncture is not always based on rigorous scientific evidence.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the NHS on the use of treatments and care of patients.
Currently, NICE only recommends considering acupuncture as a treatment option for:
chronic (long-term) pain
chronic tension-type headaches
migraines
prostatitis symptoms
hiccups
Acupuncture is also often used to treat other conditions and symptoms, including:
joint and muscle pain
jaw pain
cancer symptoms such as pain
side effects of cancer treatment such as feeling or being sick from chemotherapy
feeling sick or being sick after surgery
However, the evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with other treatments is unclear."
Acupuncture on the NHS,"Acupuncture is sometimes available on the NHS, most often from GP surgeries or physiotherapists, although access is limited.
Most acupuncture patients pay for private treatment. The cost of acupuncture varies widely between practitioners.
If you're being treated by an acupuncture practitioner for a health condition or are considering having acupuncture, it's advisable to discuss this with your GP."
How acupuncture is performed,"An initial acupuncture session usually lasts 20 minutes to 1 hour and involves an assessment of your general health, medical history and a physical examination, followed by insertion of the acupuncture needles.
Courses of treatment often involve several separate sessions, but this can vary.
Insertion of the needles
Credit:
The needles are inserted into specific places on the body, which practitioners call acupuncture points.
During the session, you'll usually be asked to sit or lie down. You may also be asked to remove some clothes so the practitioner can access certain parts of your body.
The needles used are very fine and are usually a few centimetres long. They should be single-use, pre-sterilised needles that are disposed of immediately after use.
Acupuncture practitioners choose specific points to place the needles based on your condition. Several points may be used during a typical session, depending on the number of symptoms you have.
The needles may be inserted just under the skin, or deeper so they reach muscle. Once the needles are in place, they may be left in position for a length of time lasting from a few minutes up to around 30 minutes.
You may feel a tingling or a dull ache when the needles are inserted but you should not experience any significant pain. If you do, let your practitioner know straight away."
Acupuncture safety and regulation,"There's no statutory regulation of acupuncture in England.
If you choose to have acupuncture, it is recommended that you check the acupuncture practitioner is either a regulated healthcare professional such as a doctor, nurse or physiotherapist or a member of a national acupuncture organisation.
You can find an accredited acupuncturist on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care website.
When it's done by a qualified practitioner, acupuncture is generally very safe.
Some people experience mild, short-term side effects such as:
pain where the needles puncture the skin
bleeding or bruising where the needles puncture the skin
drowsiness
feeling sick
feeling dizzy or faint
Serious side effects such as a punctured lung or infection are very rare.
If you have a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia, or are taking any medicines such as anticoagulant medicine, talk to your GP or acupuncture practitioner before you have acupuncture. 
Acupuncture is also not usually advised if you have a metal allergy or an infection in the area where needles may be inserted.
It's generally safe to have acupuncture when you're pregnant. However, let your acupuncture practitioner know if you're pregnant because certain acupuncture points cannot be used safely during pregnancy.
Read more about the safety of complementary therapies in pregnancy."
Symptoms of acute cholecystitis,"The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder.
The affected part of the tummy is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.
Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and does not go away within a few hours.
Some people may have additional symptoms, such as:
a high temperature
feeling sick
being sick
sweating
loss of appetite
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
a bulge in the tummy"
When to get medical advice,"See a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a high temperature.
If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice.
It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, as there's a risk of serious complications developing if it's not treated promptly."
What causes acute cholecystitis?,"The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.
Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.
Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge.
Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals.
The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis.
The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.
A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, sepsis, severe malnutrition or dehydration."
Diagnosing acute cholecystitis,"If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign.
You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with the GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage.
Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand.
If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment.
Tests you may have in hospital include:
blood tests – to check for signs of inflammation in your body
an ultrasound scan of your tummy – to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder"
Treating acute cholecystitis,"If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.
Initial treatment
Initial treatment will usually involve:
not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder
receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration
taking medicine to relieve your pain
You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection.
These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home.
Surgery
Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis coming back and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. 
This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy.
There are 2 main types of cholecystectomy:
open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy
laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen
If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is.
A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often recommended within 1 week of confirming acute cholecystitis.
Some people who have had their gallbladder removed have symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, but it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.
The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food.
Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal
Alternatives to surgery
Sometimes surgery may not be an option – for example, if you have another condition that makes surgery unsuitable.
If surgery is not an option, you may be offered a procedure to drain away the fluid that has collected in your gallbladder.
A narrow tube is inserted into the gallbladder to make an opening for the fluid to drain. This can be done through a cut made in the skin of your tummy, or using an endoscopic procedure (through your mouth and into the stomach)."
Possible complications,"Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
The main complications of acute cholecystitis are:
the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) – which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body
the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) – which can spread the infection within your tummy (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess)
Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about 2 or 3 in every 10 cases of acute cholecystitis."
Preventing acute cholecystitis,"It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones.
One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.
Living with overweight or obesity also increases your risk of developing gallstones.
You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.
But low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones.
A more gradual weight loss plan is best. 
Find out more about preventing gallstones
The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.
The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver.
Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored.
The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. It's an organ that's useful, but not essential, and it can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food."
Symptoms of acute kidney injury,"Symptoms of AKI include:
feeling sick or being sick
diarrhoea
dehydration
peeing less than usual
confusion
drowsiness
Even if it does not progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously.
It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some medicines are handled by the body, and could make some existing illnesses more serious.
AKI is different from chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time."
Who's at risk of acute kidney injury?,"You're more likely to get AKI if:
you're aged 65 or over
you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease
you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure, liver disease or diabetes
you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently
you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this)
you have a severe infection or sepsis
you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness
you're given aminoglycosides – a type of antibiotic that's usually only given in hospital; these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill"
Causes of acute kidney injury,"Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition.
This reduced blood flow could be caused by:
low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or severe dehydration
the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure, liver failure or sepsis
certain medicines that reduce blood pressure or blood flow to the kidneys, such as ACE inhibitors, certain diuretics or NSAIDs
AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters in the kidney (glomerulonephritis), the blood vessels (vasculitis), or other structures in the kidney.
This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays.
It may sometimes be the result of a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as:
an enlarged prostate
a tumour in the pelvis, such as an ovarian or bladder tumour
kidney stones"
Diagnosing acute kidney injury,"A doctor may suspect AKI if you:
are in an ""at risk"" group and suddenly fall ill
get symptoms of AKI
AKI is usually diagnosed with a blood test to measure your levels of creatinine, a chemical waste product produced by the muscles.
If there's a lot of creatinine in your blood, it means your kidneys are not working as well as they should.
You may also be asked to give a pee sample.
Find out more from InfoKID about AKI in children
Investigating the underlying cause
Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause.
Doctors also need to know about:
any other symptoms, such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure
any other medical conditions
any medicine that's been taken in the past week, as some medicines can cause AKI
An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour."
Treating acute kidney injury,"Treatment of AKI depends on what's causing your illness and how severe it is.
You may need:
to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated
antibiotics if you have an infection
to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted)
a urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage
You may need to go to hospital for some treatments.
Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result.
In severe cases, dialysis – where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water – may be needed."
Preventing acute kidney injury,"Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. 
It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing.
Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment.
People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip.
Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily."
Complications of acute kidney injury,"The most serious complications of acute kidney injury include:
high levels of potassium in the blood – in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems
too much fluid in the body, which can cause build-up of fluid in the arms and legs (oedema) or in the lungs (pulmonary oedema)
acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) – which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness
chronic kidney disease"
Symptoms of AML,"The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become worse over time.
Symptoms can include:
looking pale or ""washed out""
feeling tired or weak
breathlessness
frequent infections
unusual and frequent bruising or bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds
losing weight without trying to"
Seeking medical advice,"Speak to a GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML.
Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated.
If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cells.
If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a specialist in treating blood conditions (haematologist) for further tests and treatment.
Find out more about diagnosing AML"
What causes AML?,"It's not clear exactly what causes AML and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause.
But some things can increase your risk of getting AML, including:
previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment)
smoking and other exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke
having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome
Find out more about the causes of AML"
Who's affected,"AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 3,100 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK.
The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 75."
How AML is treated,"Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible, as it can develop quickly.
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).
In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.
Find out more about treating AML"
Help and support,"There are organisations that offer information, advice and support if you or a family member has been diagnosed with AML.
These include:

Symptoms of acute pancreatitis,"The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:
suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your tummy (abdomen)
feeling or being sick
a high temperature of 38C or more (fever)
Read more about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and diagnosing acute pancreatitis."
When to get medical help,"See a GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible, contact NHS 111 for advice."
Causes of acute pancreatitis,"Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to:
gallstones 
drinking too much alcohol
But sometimes the cause is not known.
By reducing how much alcohol you drink and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.
Read more about the causes of acute pancreatitis and preventing acute pancreatitis."
How it's treated,"Treatment for acute pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and manage any symptoms.
This usually involves admission to hospital. You may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenous fluids), pain relief, liquid food through a tube in your tummy and oxygen through tubes in your nose.
Most people with acute pancreatitis get better within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after a few days.
Recovery can take longer in severe cases, as some people can develop complications.
Read more about treating acute pancreatitis and the possible complications of acute pancreatitis."
Who is at risk of getting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually affects people who are already unwell.
Causes of ARDS can include:
sepsis
infections such as pneumonia
acute pancreatitis
accidentally inhaling vomit or food
drowning
smoke inhalation
severe injuries
having blood transfusions
having a lung transplant"
Symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"Symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include:
shortness of breath
taking short, fast breaths"
Treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is treated in hospital, usually in an intensive care unit (ICU).
Treatment may include:
oxygen, which you breathe in using a mask
ventilation, where a machine is used to breathe for you
medicines, such as antibiotics to treat infection
fluids given through a vein
ARDS is a life-threatening condition and cannot always be cured. There's a chance someone who has it may die."
Complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"ARDS can have long-term effects, such as:
shortness of breath
muscle weakness
pain"
Symptoms of Addison's disease,"Early-stage symptoms of Addison's disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as clinical depression or flu. 
You may experience:
lack of energy or motivation (fatigue)
muscle weakness
low mood
loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
increased thirst
Over time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, cramps and exhaustion.
You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums.
Although these symptoms are not always caused by Addison's disease, you should see a GP so they can be investigated."
Why it happens,"Addison's disease is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of the steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol.
It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK.
Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK."
Treating Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is treated with medicine to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take it for the rest of your life.
With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition have a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life with few limitations.
But many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue, and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
Adrenal crisis
People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis.
This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal.
If you or someone you know has Addison's disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, they will need a hydrocortisone injection immediately, either injected by themselves or by a person who is with them.
Then call 999 for an ambulance, saying it's an ""adrenal crisis"" or ""Addisonian crisis""."
Information about you,"If you have Addison's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about NCARDRS on GOV.UK"
Why an adenoidectomy is done,"An adenoidectomy is mainly done in children to help with problems caused by enlarged adenoids.
These problems can cause pain or partially block the airway. They include:
difficulty breathing through the nose, which can cause mouth breathing or snoring
sleep apnoea, where breathing stops and starts during sleep
glue ear, an infection in the middle ear which can cause hearing problems
frequent ear infections
The adenoids usually start to shrink around the age of 4 and disappear by early adulthood.
Your doctor might suggest waiting to see if these problems get better by themselves rather than having an adenoidectomy, depending on how serious the problems are.
An adenoidectomy may be done in adults who have these problems, but this is not common."
What happens during an adenoidectomy,"Your child will not be able to eat or drink for some time before having an adenoidectomy. The hospital will give you information about this.
The operation is usually done as a day case. This means your child should be able to go home on the same day once they're well enough.
It's done under general anaesthetic, so they'll be asleep during the operation and will not feel any pain. It usually takes about 30 minutes.
The surgeon removes the adenoids through the mouth. They will either be carefully cut out or removed using special tools that apply heat or radio frequency energy.
Dissolvable stitches may be used to stop any bleeding.
The process is the same for adults having an adenoidectomy.
An adenoidectomy may be done at the same time as a tonsil removal (adenotonsillectomy) or surgery to put a small tube in the ear to drain fluid (grommet surgery).
After the operation
Your child will spend some time in the recovery room and have medicine to help with pain and swelling.
After the operation they may:
feel sick
have a blocked nose
have a sore throat and sore ears
have a temporary change to their voice – it may sound like they are talking through their nose
have bad breath"
Recovering from an adenoidectomy,"It usually takes about a week to recover from an adenoidectomy. There are things you can do to help your child recover afterwards.
Do
keep them off school or nursery for about a week to rest
try to avoid being around other people, to reduce the chance of them getting an infection
give them paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain – follow the instructions on the leaflet that comes with the medicine
encourage them to eat their usual foods as soon as possible to help their throat heal
make sure they drink lots of fluids
Important
Never give aspirin to children under 16, unless their doctor prescribes it."
Possible complications of an adenoidectomy,"An adenoidectomy is a common and straightforward procedure.
Complications are rare but can include:
bleeding in the throat after the operation, which may need a second operation to stop it
damage to the teeth – the surgeon might chip or knock a tooth, especially if they're already loose or capped (let the hospital know if your child has any teeth like this)
infection where the adenoids were removed – antibiotics can help with this
problems breathing because of swelling in the throat
changes to the voice, but it should go back to normal after a few weeks
breathing problems or infections still happening after the operation
the adenoids growing back, but this is not common
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
Your child has recently had an adenoidectomy and they:
are in a lot of pain that does not get better with pain relief or is getting worse
have a high temperature
have a painful or stiff neck
are not drinking fluids
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. Call 111 to speak to someone if you need to get help for a child under 5.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
Your child has recently had an adenoidectomy and they have:
any bleeding from their throat or nose
blood in their sick, or black or brown sick
Find your nearest A&E"
Symptoms of adenomyosis,"Some symptoms of adenomyosis affect your periods, such as:
painful periods
heavy bleeding during your period
Other symptoms can happen any time in your menstrual cycle, such as:
pelvic pain (pain in the lower part of your tummy)
bloating, heaviness or fullness in your tummy (abdomen)
pain during sex
Some people with adenomyosis have no symptoms."
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP may ask about your periods if you have symptoms of adenomyosis. They may feel your tummy to see if there’s any swelling or bloating.
You can ask for a female doctor when you book your appointment.
The doctor might also ask to do an internal examination, to check your vagina and cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb).
You can have a friend, family member or other member of staff in the room with you during your examination if you want.
Sometimes further tests are needed to find out what’s causing your symptoms, or to rule out similar conditions such as endometriosis.
Tests may include:
ultrasound scan
MRI scan"
Treatments for adenomyosis,"If you’re diagnosed with adenomyosis, there are treatments that can help ease your symptoms.
Treatments include:
the IUS (intrauterine system, also called Mirena or hormonal coil), which thins the womb lining, making your periods lighter and less painful
other types of hormonal contraception if you cannot or do not want to have an IUS, such as the progestogen-only pill, the combined pill or the contraceptive patch
medicines such as tranexamic acid or NSAIDs
If these treatments do not work, you may need surgery.
This could be a hysterectomy, or surgery to remove the lining of your womb (endometrial ablation)."
How to ease symptoms of adenomyosis,"There are things that can help with period pain or pelvic pain caused by adenomyosis.
Do
use a heat pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a tea towel on your tummy
try a TENS machine – a small device that uses mild electrical impulses to reduce pain
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen"
Who is more likely to get adenomyosis?,"It's not clear what causes adenomyosis.
You may be more likely to get it if you are over the age of 30 and have given birth."
When to seek medical advice,"You should see an optician if you have any of these symptoms:
your eyesight is blurred or misty
you find lights too bright or glaring
you find it harder to see in low light
colours look faded
If you wear glasses, you may feel your lenses are dirty and need cleaning, even when they do not.
Cataracts are not usually painful and do not make your eyes red or irritated, but they can be painful if they're in an advanced stage or if you've got another eye condition."
Testing for age-related cataracts,"An optician will do a series of eye tests, including a visual acuity exam, which measures how well you see at various distances.
If the optician thinks you have cataracts, you may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for more tests and treatment."
Treating age-related cataracts,"If your cataracts are not too bad, stronger glasses and brighter reading lights may help for a while.
But cataracts get worse over time, so you'll eventually need surgery to remove and replace the affected lens.
Surgery is the only treatment that's proven to be effective for cataracts.

Driving and cataracts,"If you have cataracts, it could affect your ability to drive.
You do not need to tell the DVLA if you have (or previously had) cataracts and you still meet the visual standards for driving.
If you drive a bus, coach or lorry, you do not need to tell the DVLA if you have (or previously had) cataracts and:
you still meet the visual standards for driving
you do not have an increased sensitivity to glare because of the cataract
Read about cataracts and driving on the GOV.UK website"
What causes age-related cataracts?,"It's not entirely clear why we're more likely to develop cataracts as we get older, but some things may increase your risk of cataracts, including:
a family history of cataracts
smoking
diabetes
eye injury
long-term use of steroids
drinking too much alcohol"
Eye problems,"The reduced amount of melanin can cause eye problems. This is because melanin is involved in the development of the retina, the thin layer of cells at the back of the eye.
Possible eye problems linked to albinism include:
poor eyesight – either short-sightedness or long-sightedness, and low vision (sight loss that cannot be corrected)
astigmatism – where the cornea (clear layer at the front of the eye) is not perfectly curved or the lens is an abnormal shape, causing blurred vision
photophobia – where the eyes are sensitive to light
nystagmus – where the eyes move involuntarily from side to side, causing reduced vision; you do not see the world as ""wobbling"" because your brain adapts to your eye movement
squint – where the eyes point in different directions
Some young children with albinism may appear clumsy. This is because problems with their eyesight can make some movements difficult for them, such as picking up an object. This should improve as they get older."
How albinism is passed on,"The 2 main types of albinism are:
oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) – the most common type, affecting the skin, hair and eyes
ocular albinism (OA) – a rarer type that mainly affects the eyes
Autosomal recessive inheritance
In all types of OCA and some types of OA, albinism is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means a child has to get 2 copies of the gene that causes albinism (1 from each parent) to have the condition.
If both parents carry the gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance that their child will have albinism and a 1 in 2 chance that their child will be a carrier. Carriers do not have albinism but can pass on the gene.
X-linked inheritance
Most types of OA are passed on in an X-linked inheritance pattern. This pattern affects boys and girls differently: girls who get the albinism gene usually become carriers only, while boys who get it will have albinism.
When a mother is a carrier of an X-linked type of albinism, each of her daughters has a 1 in 2 chance of becoming a carrier. Each of her sons has a 1 in 2 chance of having albinism.
When a father has an X-linked type of albinism, his daughters will become carriers, and his sons will not have albinism and will not be carriers.
Genetic counselling
If you have a history of albinism in your family or you have a child with the condition, you may want to talk to a GP about getting a referral for genetic counselling.
A genetic counsellor provides information, support and advice about genetic conditions. For example, you can discuss with them how you inherited albinism and the chances of passing it on.
Read more about genetic and genomic testing"
Diagnosing albinism,"Albinism is usually obvious from a baby's appearance when they're born. Your baby's hair, skin and eyes may be examined to look for signs of missing pigment.
As albinism can cause a number of eye problems, your baby may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests.
Electrodiagnostic testing is also sometimes used to help diagnose albinism. This is where small electrodes are stuck to the scalp to test the connections of the eyes to the part of the brain that controls vision."
Treatments for eye problems due to albinism,"Although there's no cure for the eye problems caused by albinism, there are a number of treatments, such as glasses and contact lenses, that can improve vision.
A child with albinism may also need extra help and support at school.
Glasses and contact lenses
As a child with albinism gets older, they'll need regular eye tests, and it's likely they'll need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems.
Low-vision aids
Vision aids include:
large-print or high-contrast books and printed materials
magnifying lenses
a small telescope or telescopic lenses that attach to glasses to read writing in the distance, such as on a school whiteboard
large computer screens
software that can turn speech into typing or vice versa
tablets and phones that allow you to magnify the display to make writing and images easier to see
The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has more information about living with low vision, including a section on education and learning
Photophobia or sensitivity to light
Sunglasses, tinted glasses and wearing a wide-brimmed hat outside can help with sensitivity to light.
Nystagmus
There's currently no cure for nystagmus (where the eyes move from side to side involuntarily). However, it is not painful and does not get worse.
Certain toys or games may help a child make the most of the vision they have. An ophthalmologist will be able to provide further advice.
Surgery, involving dividing and then reattaching some of the eye muscles, may sometimes be an option.
Squint and lazy eye
The main treatments for squints are glasses, eye exercises, surgery and injections into the eye muscles.
If your child has developed a lazy eye, they may benefit from wearing a patch over their ""good"" eye to encourage their other eye to work harder.
Read more about treatments for squints"
Reducing the risk of sunburn and skin cancer,"Because people with albinism lack melanin in their skin, they're at increased risk of getting sunburn and skin cancer.
If you have albinism, you should wear sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor (SPF). An SPF of 30 or more will provide the best protection. You should also spend time in the shade when the sun is strongest and cover up with suitable clothing and sunglasses.
It's also a good idea to look out for skin changes, such as:
a new mole, growth or lump
any moles, freckles or patches of skin that change in size, shape or colour
Report these to a doctor as soon as possible. Skin cancer is much easier to treat if it's found early."
Help and support,"There's usually no reason why someone with albinism cannot do well in schooling, further education and employment.
With appropriate help and support, children with albinism can attend a mainstream school.
You might like to talk to other people with albinism. The Albinism Fellowship runs meetings around the UK, and has phone and email support."
Information about you,"If you or your child has albinism, your clinical team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Low-risk drinking advice,"To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low:
men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis
if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days
if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week
if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum
Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks.
The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis."
Risks of alcohol misuse,"Short term
The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include:
accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury
violent behaviour and being a victim of violence
unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones
alcohol poisoning – this may lead to vomiting, fits (seizures) and falling unconscious
People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident.
Long term
Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including:
heart disease
stroke
liver disease
liver cancer
bowel cancer
mouth cancer
breast cancer
pancreatitis
damage to the brain, which can lead to problems with thinking and memory
As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems for some people, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness.
If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism).
Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this. 
Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people.
A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including:
hand tremors – ""the shakes""
sweating
seeing things that are not real (visual hallucinations)
depression
anxiety
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
This often leads to ""relief drinking"" to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Find out more about the risks of alcohol misuse"
Am I drinking too much alcohol?,"You could be misusing alcohol if:
you feel you should cut down on your drinking
other people have been criticising your drinking
you feel guilty or bad about your drinking
you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover
Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if:
they regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week
they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking
they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking (for example, missing an appointment or work because they're drunk or hungover)"
Getting help,"If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to see a GP.
They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available. 
Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as the:
Alcohol use disorders identification test (PDF, 224kb) – a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits
Alcohol use disorders identification test consumption (PDF, 382kb) – a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels
As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem.
For example, you may want to contact:
Drinkline national alcohol helpline on 0300 123 1110
Alcohol Change UK
Alcoholics Anonymous helpline on 0800 9177 650
Al-Anon Family Groups helpline on 0800 0086 811"
Treating alcohol misuse,"How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking.
Treatment options include:
counselling – including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
medicines
detoxification – this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms
There are 2 main types of medicines to help people stop drinking.
The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium).
The second is a medicine to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medicines used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone.
These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months."

Alcohol and pregnancy,"The Department of Health and Social Care recommends pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol.
Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink.
The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum.
If you're worried about alcohol use during pregnancy, talk to your doctor or midwife.
If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more.
Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.

Check if it's alcohol poisoning,"Symptoms start after drinking a lot of alcohol and may include:
confusion
slurring words or being unable to speak
being unable to coordinate movement, for example, being unable to stand, walk, or pick things up
being sick
peeing or pooing yourself
pale or blue-tinged skin - on black or brown skin this may be easier to see inside the lips, on the gums and under the fingernails
slow or irregular breathing
having a seizure or fit
loss of consciousness"
Things you can do to help someone who has drunk too much alcohol,"Do
stay with them because there's a risk they could choke on their own sick or stop breathing
sit them up if they're awake, or put them in the recovery position if they've passed out and check they're breathing properly
give them water to sip if they're able to swallow
keep them warm with a jacket or blanket
Don’t
do not let them drink more alcohol
do not give them coffee or drinks containing caffeine because this can dehydrate people with alcohol poisoning
do not put them in a cold shower or bath because there's a risk they could get too cold, fall or lose consciousness in the water
do not try to make them sick"
Treatment for alcohol poisoning,"You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications, like liver and heart failure, which can be fatal.
You may be given fluids, which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off."
Causes of alcohol poisoning,"Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking, which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood.
Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening.
Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others, with fewer effects."
Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD),"ARLD does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged.
When this happens, symptoms can include:
feeling sick
weight loss
loss of appetite
yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin (jaundice)
swelling in the ankles and tummy
confusion or drowsiness
vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools
This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage.
If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged."
Alcohol and the liver,"The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body. 
Its functions include:
filtering toxins from the blood
aiding digestion of food
regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels
helping fight infection and disease
The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die.
The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver.
ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse.
Read more about the causes of ARLD"
Stages of ARLD,"There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained here.
Alcoholic fatty liver disease
Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver.
This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD.
Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level.
Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for some time (months or years), your liver should return to normal.
Alcoholic hepatitis
Alcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis, is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period.
When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol.
Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).
The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.
Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness.
Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.
Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.
It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy."
Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD),"There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life.
This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering.
If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult.
But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services.
A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol.
You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking.
All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life."
Complications,"Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades.
Alcohol misuse is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure.
Life-threatening complications of ARLD include:
internal (variceal) bleeding
build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy)
fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure
liver cancer
increased vulnerability to infection
Read more about the complications of ARLD"
Preventing alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD),"The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits:
men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week
if you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week
A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits.
Even if you have been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short-term and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health."
Key principles,"The main principles of the Alexander technique are:
""how you move, sit and stand affects how well you function""
""the relationship of the head, neck and spine is fundamental to your ability to function optimally""
""becoming more mindful of the way you go about your daily activities is necessary to make changes and gain benefit""
""the mind and body work together intimately as one, each constantly influencing the other""
Teachers of the technique say that conditions such as backache and other sorts of long-term pain are often the result of misusing your body over a long period of time, such as moving inefficiently and standing or sitting with your weight unevenly distributed.
The aim of the Alexander technique is to help you ""unlearn"" these bad habits and achieve a balanced, more naturally aligned body."
Learning the Alexander technique,"The Alexander technique is taught by a qualified teacher in 1-to-1 lessons.
Lessons often take place in a studio, clinic or the teacher's house and usually last 30 to 45 minutes. You'll be asked to wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing so you're able to move easily.
The teacher will observe your movements and show you how to move, sit, lie down and stand with better balance and less strain. They'll use their hands to gently guide you in your movements, help you maintain a better relationship between your head, neck and spine, and to release muscle tension.
You'll need to attend a number of lessons to learn the basic concepts of the Alexander technique. Often, around 20 or more weekly lessons are recommended.
Teachers of the technique say you may see an improvement in aches and pains fairly soon after starting the lessons, but that you need to be committed to putting what you learn into practice and it may take a considerable amount of time to see the full benefits.
The overall aim is to help you gain an understanding of the main principles involved so you can apply them to everyday life, allowing you to benefit from the technique without the need for frequent ongoing lessons."
Does the Alexander technique work?,"Supporters of the Alexander technique often claim it can help people with a wide range of health conditions. Some of these claims are supported by scientific evidence, but some have not yet been properly tested.
There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with:
long-term back pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more
long-term neck pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more
Parkinson's disease – lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition
If you have one of these conditions and you're considering trying the Alexander technique, it's a good idea to speak to your GP or specialist first to check if it might be suitable for you.
Some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering, and balance skills in older people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed.
There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress."
Availability and regulation,"Alexander technique lessons are mostly available privately. Each lesson usually costs around £35 to £50.
However, in recent years some NHS trusts have started to offer Alexander technique lessons as part of their outpatient pain clinics. Ask your GP whether it's available through the NHS in your local area.
Finding a teacher
If you're thinking about trying the Alexander technique, it's important to choose a teacher who's experienced and qualified.
There aren't currently any laws or regulations stating what training someone must have to teach the Alexander technique. Professional organisations offer courses (often for 3 years) and membership upon successful completion of the course.
Teachers must meet certain requirements to register with these organisations and agree to comply with their code of ethics.
In the UK, the main organisations for teachers of the Alexander technique are the:
Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CHNC)
Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique (STAT)
Interactive Teaching Method Association (ITM)
Professional Association of Alexander Teachers (PAAT)
Alexander Technique International (ATI)
Of these, only the CHNC has been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority."
Risks and limitations,"For most people, Alexander technique lessons are safe and pose no health risks. No manipulation of your body is involved, just gentle touch.
However, the technique may not be suitable for certain people, such as those with specific spinal problems like an injury or slipped disc. These problems will need specialist medical treatment.
It's important to remember that most teachers of the Alexander technique aren't medical professionals. They should not diagnose, offer advice on or treat conditions that should be managed by a suitably qualified mainstream healthcare professional."
Signs and symptoms in adults,"Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body.
It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems.
Joints and bones
When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 30s, they may start to experience joint problems.
Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness, followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are similar to the early symptoms of osteoarthritis. 
Eventually, cartilage – a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body – may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations may be needed.
Eyes and ears
Many people develop brown or black spots on the whites of their eyes.
Another sign in many adults with alkaptonuria is thickening of ear cartilage. The cartilage may also look blue, grey or black. This is called ochronosis.
The earwax may be black or reddish-brown.
Alkaptonuria can cause dark spots in the whites of the eyes
Alkaptonuria can thicken the ear cartilage and make it look blue-black
Skin and nails
Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish or brownish colour.
The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found – the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area.
Breathing difficulties
If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Heart, kidney and prostate problems
Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to narrow, harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken.
This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements.
The deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones."
How alkaptonuria is inherited,"Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents.
One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell.
The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid.
You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the condition is very rare.
The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they will not have any signs or symptoms of the condition."
How alkaptonuria is managed,"Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition.
A medicine called nitisinone is used to slow the advance of alkaptonuria in adults.
Painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms.
Nitisinone
Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It’s offered at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients, based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital.
Find out about the National Alkaptonuria Centre and nitisinone treatment on the Alkaptonuria Society website
Diet
A protein-controlled diet can be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian will assess and advise you about this.
Exercise
If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints.
Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms.
But avoid exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby. Gentle exercise such as yoga and pilates might help in the early stages, while cycling, walking and swimming may be more suitable for advanced alkaptonuria.
Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints.

Emotional support
A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed.
But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website, a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers.
Surgery
Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened.
Your doctor may recommend:
hip replacement
knee replacement
aortic valve replacement"
Outlook,"People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will eventually experience symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints and spine, which can affect quality of life.
Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around.
Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support."
Sharing your information,"If you or your child have alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass relevant patient information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS register on GOV.UK"
Check if it's allergic rhinitis,"Common symptoms of allergic rhinitis are similar to a cold and include:
sneezing
an itchy nose
a runny or blocked nose
itchy, red and watery eyes
a cough
the roof of your mouth being itchy
This usually happens within minutes of coming into contact with something you're allergic to."
Causes of allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction.
Common allergies include:
pollen from trees, grass and weeds (hay fever)
house dust mites
animals such as dogs and cats
mould
wood dust, flour dust and latex
You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma.
Information:
Allergic rhinitis is different from non-allergic rhinitis, which is caused by things like having a cold, very hot or cold temperatures and humidity."
How you can treat allergic rhinitis yourself,"You can often treat allergic rhinitis without seeing a GP.
If you can, try to avoid the things that trigger your allergies.
A pharmacist can also advise you about medicines that can help, such as:
antihistamines
decongestant nasal sprays or drops to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be used by children under 6)
salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose
You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week as this can make your symptoms worse.
Find a pharmacy
How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution
If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better."
Treatments for allergic rhinitis from a GP,"If pharmacy medicines do not help ease your allergic rhinitis symptoms, a GP may prescribe a different medicine, such as prescription steroid nasal sprays or antihistamines.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe."
Preventing allergic rhinitis,"If you have allergic rhinitis, it's not always possible to avoid the things you're allergic to. But there are steps you can take to try to help reduce your symptoms.
Do
wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen
use hypoallergenic bedding and covers, and wash bedding regularly at 60C and above
dust with a damp cloth and use a vacuum with a HEPA filter
wash pets at least once every 2 weeks and groom them outside regularly
regularly wash your pet's bedding and clean any furniture they've been on
keep your home dry and well-ventilated, and deal with any damp and condensation
Don’t
do not allow pets in bedrooms
do not go outside or dry clothes outside when the pollen count is high, if possible"
Causes of allergies,"Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.
Common allergens include:
tree and grass pollen (hay fever)
house dust mites
foods, such as peanuts, milk and eggs (food allergy)
animals, particularly pets like cats and dogs
insect stings, such as bee and wasp stings
certain medicines"
Check if it's an allergy,"Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include:
a runny nose or sneezing
pain or tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead
coughing, wheezing or breathlessness
itchy skin or a raised rash (hives)
diarrhoea
feeling or being sick
swollen eyes, lips, mouth or throat"
What happens at your appointment,"A GP may arrange some allergy tests or refer you to a specialist allergy clinic to have them.
Tests you may have include:
a skin prick or patch test – where a small amount of the allergen is put on your skin to see if it reacts
blood tests – to check for allergens that may be causing your symptoms
a special diet where you avoid or eat less of a food you might be allergic to, to see if your symptoms get better"
Treatments for allergies,"Treatments for allergies include:
trying to avoid the thing you're allergic to whenever possible
medicines for mild allergic reactions like antihistamines, steroid tablets and steroid creams
emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors, such as an EpiPen, for severe allergic reactions
desensitisation (immunotherapy) for severe allergic reactions – this involves carefully exposing you to the thing you're allergic to over time, so your body gradually gets used to it and does not react so badly (this should only be done by a medical professional)
Your specialist will give you an allergy management plan that will explain how to manage your allergy."
Check if you're at risk of altitude sickness,"You can get altitude sickness if you're in a place that is at a high altitude (usually more than 2,500 metres above sea level).
You're more likely to get it if you travel or climb to a high altitude quickly.
You can get it in places like:
Mount Everest in Nepal
Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
some places in the Alps
La Paz in Bolivia
You cannot get altitude sickness in the UK."
Symptoms of altitude sickness,"Symptoms of altitude sickness usually start 6 to 10 hours after being at a high altitude.
The main symptoms include:
a headache
loss of appetite
feeling or being sick
feeling tired or exhausted
dizziness
difficulty sleeping
Sometimes, the symptoms can develop into more serious symptoms that can be life-threatening."
What to do if you get altitude sickness,"If you're at a high altitude and have symptoms of altitude sickness or feel unwell:
tell someone who you're travelling with that you do not feel well
rest at the same altitude until you feel better – do not travel or climb to a higher altitude
you can take anti-sickness medicine or painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to ease symptoms
Symptoms of altitude sickness usually get better in 1 to 3 days.
If your symptoms have gone and you feel better, you can travel or climb to a higher altitude.
Important:
If your symptoms do not get better
If your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 1 day, go to a lower altitude if you can. Try to go around 300 to 1,000 metres lower."
Treatment for altitude sickness,"Altitude sickness usually gets better without treatment if you rest.
You may be given medicine to help ease symptoms.
If your symptoms are more serious, you may be given:
steroid medicine
medicine to lower your blood pressure
oxygen through a mask
Rarely, you may need to be treated with oxygen in a special air-tight chamber (hyperbaric chamber) to increase the level of oxygen in your blood."
How to reduce your risk of altitude sickness,"There are some things you can do to help reduce your risk of getting altitude sickness.
Do
travel or climb to a high altitude slowly to give your body time to get used to lower oxygen levels
spend a few days at an altitude below 2,500 metres before going any higher
have a rest day at the same altitude every 3 to 4 days (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more)
drink enough water so you do not get dehydrated
speak to a GP or travel clinic if you've had altitude sickness before or if you're travelling to a high altitude quickly – they may prescribe medicine to help prevent altitude sickness
Don’t
try not to travel from an altitude that's less than 1,200 metres to an altitude that's more than 3,500 metres in 1 day
try not to fly directly to a place with a high altitude – if this is not possible, rest for 1 day before going any higher
try not to sleep more than 500 metres higher than you slept the night before (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more)
do not drink alcohol while travelling or climbing"
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions.
The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems.
For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.
As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as:
confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places
difficulty planning or making decisions
problems with speech and language
problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks
personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others
hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue)
low mood or anxiety
Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease."
Who is affected?,"Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65.
The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80.
But around 1 in every 20 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease."
Getting a diagnosis,"As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older.
Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a ""normal"" part of the ageing process.
An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help.
If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP.
If possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed.
If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.
There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease.
A GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions.
If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to:
assess your symptoms in more detail
organise further testing, such as brain scans if necessary
create a treatment and care plan
Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease."
How Alzheimer's disease is treated,"There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medicines are available that can help relieve some of the symptoms.
Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks.
Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.
Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease."
Outlook,"People with Alzheimer's disease can live for several years after they start to develop symptoms. But this can vary considerably from person to person.
Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause.
As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing.
This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs), which can cause frequent chest infections.
It's also common for people with Alzheimer's disease to eventually have difficulty eating and have a reduced appetite.
There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer's disease need palliative care.
This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's."
Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?,"As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition.
But there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as:
stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol
eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight
staying physically fit and mentally active
These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.
Read more about preventing Alzheimer's disease."
Dementia research,"There are dozens of dementia research projects going on around the world, many of which are based in the UK.
If you have a diagnosis of dementia or are worried about memory problems, you can help scientists better understand the disease by taking part in research.
If you're a carer for someone with dementia, you can also take part in research.
You can sign up to take part in trials on the NHS Join Dementia Research website."
More information,"Dementia can affect all aspects of a person's life, as well as their family's.
If you have been diagnosed with dementia, or you're caring for someone with the condition, remember that advice and support is available to help you live well.

Check if you have a lazy eye,"A lazy eye does not always cause symptoms and is often first diagnosed during an eye test.
The main symptoms include:
shutting 1 eye or squinting when looking at things
eyes pointing in different directions (a squint)
not being able to follow an object or person with your eyes
tilting your head when looking at something
having tired eyes and rubbing your eyes a lot
headaches
difficulty catching or throwing
tripping or falling over a lot
blinking a lot
Many children do not notice anything wrong with their vision.
You can check a younger child's eyes by covering each eye with your hand, 1 at a time. They may complain if you cover their good eye.
Older children may say they're not able to see as well with 1 eye and may have problems with reading, writing and drawing."
What happens during an eye test,"To check if you or your child have a lazy eye, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test.
You'll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes.
To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given eye drops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly.
If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician."
Treatments for a lazy eye,"How lazy eye is treated depends on what's causing it.
Treatment for a lazy eye aims to improve vision in the weaker eye.
This may include:
wearing glasses to correct your vision
wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye for a few hours a day for several months – these are usually worn with glasses
using eye drops to temporarily blur vision in the stronger eye
Treatment should ideally start before the age of 7, when vision is still developing.
If lazy eye is caused by cataracts or a drooping eyelid, you may need surgery.
You may also need to have surgery if you have a squint. This will straighten the eyes and allow them to work together better, but does not improve your vision."
What happens at your appointment,"If you're having problems with your memory, a GP will ask you some questions to try to find the cause.
It might be useful to bring someone else with you who can help describe the problems you're having.
The GP may refer you to a memory specialist for an in-depth assessment. Further tests, such as scans, may also sometimes be needed.
Any treatment that's recommended will depend on the cause of your memory problems."
Causes of memory loss,"Memory loss can just be a natural part of getting older.
Sometimes it may be caused by something common and treatable like:
stress
anxiety or depression
sleeping problems (insomnia)
Occasionally, memory loss can be a sign of something more serious, such as dementia.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your memory loss – always see a GP."
When amniocentesis is offered,"Amniocentesis is not offered to all pregnant women. It's only offered if there's a higher chance your baby could have a genetic condition.
This could be because:
an antenatal screening test has suggested your baby may be born with a condition, such as Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome
you have had a previous pregnancy that was affected by a genetic condition
you have a family history of a genetic condition, such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
It's important to remember that you do not have to have amniocentesis if it's offered. It's up to you to decide whether you want it.
A midwife or doctor will speak to you about what the test involves and let you know what the possible benefits and risks are to help you make a decision.
Find out about why amniocentesis is offered and deciding whether to have it"
How amniocentesis is performed,"Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, but you can have it later if necessary.
It can be performed earlier, but this may increase the risk of complications of amniocentesis and is usually avoided.
During the test, a long, thin needle is inserted through your abdominal wall, guided by an ultrasound image.
The needle is passed into the amniotic sac that surrounds your baby and a small sample of amniotic fluid is removed for analysis.
The test itself usually takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes.
Amniocentesis is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful.
Some women describe experiencing a pain similar to period pain or feeling pressure when the needle is taken out.
Find out more about what happens during amniocentesis"
Getting your results,"The first results of the test should be available within 3 working days and will tell you whether Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome has been discovered.
If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take 3 weeks or more for the results to come back.
If your test shows that your baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition, the implications will be fully discussed with you.
There's no cure for most of the conditions amniocentesis finds, so you'll need to consider your options carefully.
You may choose to continue with your pregnancy, while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared.
Find out more about having a baby that might be born with a condition
Or you may consider ending your pregnancy (having a termination).
Find out more about the results of amniocentesis"
What are the risks of amniocentesis?,"Before you decide to have amniocentesis, the risks and possible complications will be discussed with you.
One of the main risks associated with amniocentesis is miscarriage, which is the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks.
This is estimated to occur in up to 1 out of every 200 women who have amniocentesis.
There are also some other risks, such as infection or needing to have the procedure again because it was not possible to accurately test the first sample.
The risk of amniocentesis causing complications is higher if it's carried out before the 15th week of pregnancy, which is why the test is only done after this point.
Find out more about the possible complications of amniocentesis"
What are the alternatives?,"An alternative to amniocentesis is a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
This is where a small sample of cells from the placenta, the organ that links the mother's blood supply with her baby's, is removed for testing.
It's usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary.
With CVS, the risk of miscarriage is similar to the risk of miscarriage for amniocentesis (up to 1 out of every 200).
As the test can be carried out earlier, you'll have more time to consider the results.
If you're offered tests to look for a genetic or chromosomal condition in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you and help you make a decision."
Why amputation may be needed,"An amputation may be needed for many reasons, including if:
you have a severe infection in your limb
your limb has been affected by gangrene (often as a result of peripheral arterial disease)
you have complications from diabetes
there's serious trauma to your limb, such as a crush or blast wound
your limb is deformed and has limited movement and function"
Assessment before surgery,"Unless you need to have an emergency amputation, you'll be fully assessed before surgery to identify the most suitable type of amputation and any factors that may affect your rehabilitation.
The assessment is likely to include a thorough medical examination to check your physical condition, such as your cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels) and your respiratory system (lungs and airways).
The doctor will also check the condition and function of your healthy limb. Removing one limb can place extra strain on the remaining limb, so it's important to look after the healthy limb.
It may also include a psychological assessment to determine how well you'll cope with the psychological and emotional impact of amputation, and whether you'll need additional support.
There may be an assessment of your home, work and social environments to check if any changes will need to be made to help you cope.
You may also be introduced to a physiotherapist, who will be involved in your post-operative care. A prosthetist (a specialist in prosthetic limbs) will advise you about the type and function of prosthetic limbs or other devices available.
If you're having a planned amputation, you might find it reassuring to talk to someone who's had a similar type of amputation. A member of your care team may be able to arrange this."
How amputations are done,"Amputations can be done under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or using either an epidural anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic (both of which numb the lower half of the body). The choice of anaesthetic can depend on what part of your body is being amputated.
Most amputations involve removing a section of a limb rather than the entire limb.
Once the section of the limb has been amputated, additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining part of the limb and reduce the risk of complications.
These include shortening and smoothing the bone in the remaining section of the limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle. The surgeon then stitches the muscle to the bones to help strengthen the remaining section (a technique known as myodesis).
After the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection."
Recovering after an amputation,"After surgery, you may be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover in a ward.
A small flexible tube (urinary catheter) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain urine. This means you will not need to get out of bed to go to the toilet for the first few days after the operation. You may be given a commode or bedpan so you can also poo without having to get up to use the toilet.
The site of the operation may be painful, so you'll be given painkillers if you need them. Tell a member of your care team if the painkillers are not working, as you may need a larger dose or a stronger painkiller.
Your physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to help prevent blood clots and improve your blood supply while you're recovering in hospital.
Compression garments
You'll notice swelling (oedema) of the stump after surgery. This is normal and it may continue after you've been discharged.
Using a compression garment will help with swelling and the shape of the stump. It may also reduce phantom pain (pain that seems to be coming from your missing limb) and help support the limb.
You'll be fitted with a compression garment once your wound has healed. It should be worn every day, but taken off at bedtime. You should be given at least 2 garments, which should be washed regularly.
Rehabilitation
Physical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process. It can be a long, difficult and frustrating process, but it's important to persevere. After rehabilitation, you may be able to return to work and other activities.
Your rehabilitation programme will be tailored to your individual needs and will aim to allow you to do as many of your normal activities as possible.
You'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set.
Your rehabilitation programme will usually start the day after your operation. It may begin with simple exercises you can do while lying down or sitting. If you've had a leg amputation, you'll be encouraged to move around as soon as possible using a wheelchair.
You'll also be taught ""transfer techniques"" to help you move around more easily, such as how to get into a wheelchair from your bed.
Once your wound has started to heal, you may start working on an exercise programme with a physiotherapist in the hospital to help you maintain your mobility and muscle strength.
If you have a prosthetic limb fitted, your physiotherapist will teach you how to use it. For example, how to walk on a prosthetic leg or grip with a prosthetic hand.
Going home and follow-up
The length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health.
Before you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see if your home needs to be adapted to make it more accessible.
For example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift. If these types of modifications are needed, the issue can be referred to your local social care and support services. Find out more about walking aids, wheelchairs and mobility scooters and assessing your care and support needs.
You may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had an amputation of a lower limb.
You'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after you leave hospital, to discuss how you're coping at home and whether you need additional help, support or equipment.
At your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation."
Prosthetic limbs,"After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted.
Prosthetic limbs are not suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required.
Adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb.
This is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb.
If you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on:
the type of amputation you had
the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb
your general health
tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform
whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or you're more concerned with function
If it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but it cannot be used like a prosthetic limb.
It's possible to have a prosthetic limb that's both physically realistic and functional, but there may have to be an element of compromise between the different types.
Preparing to have a prosthetic limb fitted
If a prosthetic limb is suitable for you, you'll begin a programme of activities while still in hospital to prepare for the prosthesis.
Before a prosthetic limb is fitted, the skin covering your stump may be made less sensitive (known as desensitisation). This will make the prosthesis more comfortable to wear.
Skin desensitisation involves:
gently tapping the skin with a face cloth
using compression bandages to help reduce swelling and prevent a build-up of fluid inside and around the stump
rubbing and pulling the skin around your bone to prevent excessive scarring
Your physiotherapist will teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles in your remaining limb and improve your general energy levels, so you're able to cope better with the demands of an artificial limb.
Depending on what's available in your local area, it can be several weeks before you get your first appointment with a prosthetist."
Stump care,"It's very important to keep the skin on the surface of your stump clean to reduce the risk of it becoming irritated or infected.
Gently wash your stump at least once a day (more frequently in hot weather) with mild unscented soap and warm water, and dry it carefully.
If you have a prosthetic limb, you should also regularly clean the socket using soap and warm water.
When taking a bath, avoid leaving your stump submerged in water for long periods because the water will soften the skin on your stump, making it more vulnerable to injury.
If your skin becomes dry, use an unscented moisturising cream before bedtime or when you're not wearing your prosthesis.
Some people find wearing one or more socks around their stump helps absorb sweat and reduces skin irritation. The size of your stump may change as the swelling goes down, so the number of socks you need to use may vary. You should change the socks every day.
Check your stump carefully every day for signs of infection, such as:
warm, red and tender skin
discharge of fluid or pus
increasing swelling
Contact your care team for advice if you think you may be developing a skin infection.
Caring for your remaining limb
After having a leg or foot amputated, it's very important to avoid injuring your remaining ""good"" leg and foot, particularly if your amputation was needed because of diabetes. Your remaining leg and foot may also be at risk.
Avoid wearing poorly fitting footwear and ensure that an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, is involved in the care of your remaining foot. You should also be offered a regular review of your foot by a foot care team."
Complications,"Like any type of operation, an amputation carries a risk of complications. It also carries a risk of additional problems directly related to the loss of a limb.
There are a number of factors that influence the risk of complications from amputation, such as your age, the type of amputation you've had and your general health.
The risk of serious complications is lower in planned amputations than in emergency amputations.
Complications associated with having an amputation include:
heart problems such as heart attack
DVT (deep vein thrombosis)
slow wound healing and wound infection
pneumonia
stump and ""phantom limb"" pain
In some cases, further surgery may be needed to correct problems that develop or to help relieve pain. For example, if neuromas (thickened nerve tissue) are thought to be causing pain, the affected cluster of nerves may need to be removed.
Stump and ""phantom limb"" pain
Many people who have an amputation experience some degree of stump pain or ""phantom limb"" pain.
Stump pain can have many different causes, including rubbing or sores where the stump touches a prosthetic limb, nerve damage during surgery and the development of neuromas.
Phantom limb sensations are sensations that seem to be coming from the amputated limb. Occasionally, these can be painful (phantom limb pain).
The term ""phantom"" does not mean the sensations are imaginary. Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon, which has been confirmed using brain imaging scans to study how nerve signals are transmitted to the brain.
The symptoms of phantom limb pain can range from mild to severe. Some people have described brief ""flashes"" of mild pain, similar to an electric shock, that last for a few seconds. Others have described constant severe pain.
Treating stump and phantom limb pain
Stump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms.
Medicines
Medicines that may be used to help relieve pain include:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen
anticonvulsants such as pregabalin or gabapentin
antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or nortriptyline, which are useful in treating nerve pain
opioids such as codeine or morphine
corticosteroid or local anaesthetic injections
Self-help measures and complementary therapy
There are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve pain in some people. They include: 
adjusting the way your prosthesis fits to make it more comfortable
massage to increase circulation and stimulate muscles
acupuncture is thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses a small, battery-operated device to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals
Mental imagery
Research has shown that people who imagine using the part of their limb that was amputated experience a reduction in pain symptoms.
This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain. Researchers think the brain looks to receive feedback from an amputated limb, and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitute for this missing feedback.
Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve phantom pain."
Psychological impact of amputation,"The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one.
Coming to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands.
Having an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for 3 main reasons:
you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb
you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb
your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed
Negative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they do not have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery.
Common emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include:
depression
anxiety
denial (refusing to accept they need to make changes, such as having physiotherapy, to adapt to life after an amputation)
grief
People who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Talk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation."
Help and support,"Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt and with appropriate treatment and support.
There are a number of charities that can provide advice and support for people living with amputations, which include:
The Limbless Association
Douglas Bader Foundation
Steel Bones
Amputation Foundation
Blesma, The Limbless Veterans"
Symptoms of amyloidosis,"Common symptoms of amyloidosis include:
feeling very tired or weak
losing weight without trying to
shortness of breath
swollen feet or legs
bruising around your eyes
Other symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected, so you may not have all the symptoms. They can include:
a fast or slow heartbeat or chest pain, if your heart is affected
loss of appetite, feeling or being sick, diarrhoea or constipation, if your digestive system is affected
frothy pee, if your kidneys are affected
pain, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, if your nerves are affected
Important
These symptoms can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have amyloidosis. But it's important to get them checked by a GP."
How you get amyloidosis,"There are several types of amyloidosis, with different causes.
Causes of the main types of amyloidosis
Type Cause
AL amyloidosis
A problem with your bone marrow. Sometimes linked with multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer.
AA amyloidosis
Long-term inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, or infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB).
Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis
An inherited genetic condition.
Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis
Develops as you get older, usually affecting men over 75 years old.
Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis
Having long-term dialysis."
Tests for amyloidosis,"If a GP thinks you may have amyloidosis they'll refer you to a specialist. You may be seen in a specialist amyloidosis treatment centre.
Amyloidosis is often hard to diagnose because the symptoms vary and are similar to other conditions.
You'll usually have tests such as:
blood tests and urine tests
tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram or MRI scan, to check your heart and other organs
a biopsy, where a small sample of cells is removed and tested to check for amyloid
a type of scan called a SAP scan, to show where amyloid has built up in your body
genetic testing to find out if you have a hereditary type of amyloidosis
These tests will show what type of amyloidosis you have and how it's affecting you."
Treatments for amyloidosis,"There's no cure for amyloidosis, but some types can be managed well through treatment to improve the symptoms. But for some people, amyloidosis eventually leads to organs such as your heart or kidneys no longer working properly.
Your doctor will explain your treatment options and what to expect.
If your amyloidosis is caused by another health condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, treating the condition can improve your symptoms.
Other treatments depend on what type of amyloidosis you have and what parts of your body are affected. Treatments may include:
medicines to help with symptoms, such as painkillers, anti-sickness medicines, or medicines that reduce swelling (diuretics)
medicines to reduce the amount of amyloid your body produces
kidney dialysis, if your kidneys are not working properly
a kidney transplant or liver transplant, if these organs are damaged
Treatments for AL amyloidosis
If you have AL amyloidosis, caused by a problem with your bone marrow, you may be offered:
chemotherapy to destroy the blood cells in your bone marrow that cause the condition
a stem cell or bone marrow transplant"
Recording information about you and your condition,"If you have amyloidosis, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Are anabolic steroids illegal?,"Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be issued by pharmacists with a prescription.
It's legal to have anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service.
However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence of up to 14 years.
In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. If you do test positive, you may be banned from competing professionally."
Why people misuse anabolic steroids,"Anabolic steroids can be used as performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some people take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies.
However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphic disorder. This is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. These flaws are often unnoticeable to others.
People who have body dysmorphic disorder may take anabolic steroids because they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough.
Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit."
How anabolic steroids are taken,"Anabolic steroids are usually injected into a muscle or taken by mouth as tablets, but they also come as creams or gels that are applied to the skin.
Many people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and believe that by taking the drugs in certain ways they can avoid side effects. Or they may take additional medicines to try to counter the side effects.
Users might:
Take the drugs for a period of time and then stop for a rest period before starting again. This is known as ""cycling"".
Take more than one type of anabolic steroid at a time, known as ""stacking"", which they believe makes the steroids work better.
Do a combination of both stacking and cycling, known as ""pyramiding"", where they start off taking a low dose of one or more anabolic steroids, and then increase the dose over time up to a maximum dose. They then stop taking them for a rest period to give the body a break before starting the cycle again.
But there is no evidence that any of these methods actually reduce side effects and harms from taking anabolic steroids.
Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time."
Side effects of anabolic steroids,"Regularly taking anabolic steroids can lead to physical and psychological changes in both men and women, as well as potentially dangerous medical conditions.
Physical effects
Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include:
reduced sperm count
infertility
shrunken testicles
erectile dysfunction
hair loss
breast development
increased risk of prostate cancer
severe acne
stomach pain
In women, anabolic steroids can cause:
facial hair growth and body hair
loss of breasts
swelling of the clitoris
a deepened voice
an increased sex drive
problems with periods
hair loss
severe acne
In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions:
heart attack or stroke
liver or kidney problems or failure
high blood pressure (hypertension)
blood clots
fluid retention
high cholesterol
Psychological effects
Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects:
aggressive behaviour
mood swings
paranoia
manic behaviour
hallucinations and delusions
Stunted growth in adolescents
Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth.
Sharing needles
As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include:
damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene
hepatitis B infection
hepatitis C infection
HIV transmission"
Addiction,"Anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking it.
A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will want to keep using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects.
When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose.
Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include:
depression and apathy
feelings of anxiety
difficulty concentrating
insomnia
anorexia
decreased sex drive
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
headaches
muscle and joint pain"
Getting help ,"You should see a GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction.
The GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus tips for dealing with those obstacles.

Check if you have iron deficiency anaemia,"Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia can include:
tiredness and lack of energy
shortness of breath
noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)
paler than usual skin
headaches
Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia"
What happens at your appointment,"To check if you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history.
If the reason for the anaemia is not clear, they might order some tests to find out what might be causing the symptoms.
They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks.
Blood tests for iron deficiency anaemia
The GP will usually order a full blood count (FBC) test. This will find out if the number of red blood cells you have (your red blood cell count) is normal.
You do not need to do anything to prepare for this test.
Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are other types, like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia, that the blood test will also check for."
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia,"Once the reason you have iron deficiency anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment.
If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body.
You'll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron.
Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets.
Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like:
constipation or diarrhoea
tummy pain
heartburn
feeling sick
darker than usual poo
Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects.
It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects.
Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal."
Things you can do to help with iron deficiency anaemia,"If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them.
Eat more:
dark-green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale
cereals and bread with extra iron in them (fortified)
meat
dried fruit like apricots, prunes and raisins
pulses (beans, peas and lentils)
Eat and drink less:
tea
coffee
milk and dairy
foods with high levels of phytic acid, such as wholegrain cereals, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and tablets
Large amounts of these foods and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron.
You might be referred to a specialist dietitian if you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet."
Causes of iron deficiency anaemia,"Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine.
In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet.
Bleeding in the stomach and intestines is another common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by:
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin
stomach ulcers
inflammation of the bowel or food pipe (oesophagus)
piles
cancers of the bowel or stomach – but this is less common
Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could also lead to iron deficiency anaemia."
If iron deficiency anaemia is not treated,"Untreated iron deficiency anaemia:
can make you more at risk of illness and infection – a lack of iron affects the immune system
may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs – such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure
can cause a greater risk of complications before and after birth if you're pregnant"
Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency,"Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.
A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:
extreme tiredness
a lack of energy
pins and needles
a sore and red tongue
mouth ulcers
muscle weakness
problems with your vision
psychological problems, which can range from mild depression or anxiety to confusion and dementia
problems with memory, understanding and judgement
Some of these problems can also happen if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate but do not have anaemia."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.
It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.
This is because although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible."
Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency,"There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
These include:
pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK
a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can happen if you have a vegan diet and do not take vitamin B12 supplements or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 , follow a restrictive diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time
medicine – certain medicines, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs
Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74."
Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,"Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.
Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first.
Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections.
Treatments may last until your vitamin B12 levels have improved or you may need treatment for the rest of your life.
Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for 4 months.
In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it coming back.
Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and specially fortified foods.
Good sources of folate include green vegetables, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and peas."
Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,"Although it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you have been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time.
Potential complications can include:
problems with the nervous system
temporary infertility
heart conditions
pregnancy complications and birth defects
Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure.
Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others, such as problems with the nervous system, can sometimes be permanent."
Types of anaesthesia,"As well as local and general anaesthetic, there are a number of other types of anaesthesia.
Unlike general anaesthetic, these do not make you unconscious – they just stop you feeling pain in a particular area of your body.
The different types of anaesthetic are:
regional anaesthetic – a local anaesthetic given to a specific region of your body, leading to numbness or pain relief for deeper operations where more extensive numbness is needed
epidural anaesthetic – a type of regional anaesthetic usually used to numb the lower half of the body; for example, as pain relief during labour and childbirth
spinal anaesthetic – a type of regional anaesthetic used to give total numbness, lasting about 3 hours, to the lower parts of the body, such as in the base of your spine or in your lower back, so surgery can be safely carried out in this area
sedation – medicine that makes you feel sleepy and relaxes you both physically and mentally; it's sometimes used to keep you calm during minor, painful or unpleasant procedures
Different types of anaesthesia can be used in combination. For example, a regional anaesthetic can be used with a general anaesthetic to relieve pain after an operation.
A sedative is also sometimes used with a regional anaesthetic to help you feel relaxed and calm, as well as pain-free, during an operation."
How anaesthetics are given,"An anaesthetic can be given in a number of ways:
as an ointment, spray or drops
as an injection into a vein
as a gas you breathe in"
Anaesthetists,"Anaesthetists are doctors who have received specialist training in anaesthesia. They'll give you your anaesthetic and be responsible for your safety and wellbeing during your procedure.
Before the procedure, your anaesthetist will discuss a number of things with you, including:
the types of anaesthetic appropriate for the procedure you're having
any risks or side effects associated with different types of anaesthetic
They'll plan your anaesthetic and pain control with you, taking into account any preferences you have for a particular type of anaesthetic. You should ask your anaesthetist to clarify anything you're unsure about.
If you have a general anaesthetic, your anaesthetist will carefully monitor you throughout your operation and make sure you wake up comfortably afterwards. They may also help with any pain relief you might need after the procedure."
Side effects,"Anaesthetics consist of a number of medicines that can cause side effects in some people. Your anaesthetist will tell you about any side effects you may experience after having a specific type of anaesthetic and measures that will be taken to reduce these.
Some common side effects that can occur after a general anaesthetic or some regional anaesthetics include:
feeling or being sick
dizziness and feeling faint
feeling cold or shivering
headaches
itchiness
bruising and soreness
difficulty peeing
aches and pains
The side effects of anaesthetic usually do not last very long and, if necessary, some of them can be treated.
Tell the healthcare professionals treating you if you experience any of the above side effects, or if you're in pain after your procedure."
Risks and complications,"In recent years, having anaesthesia has become very safe. Advances in equipment, medicine and training mean serious problems are rare.
However, as with any type of surgery or medical procedure, there's a potential risk of complications.
The benefits and risks of surgery and anaesthesia will be carefully weighed up and explained to you before you have any operation.
The complications of anaesthesia listed below are very rare.
Permanent nerve damage
This can cause numbness or paralysis (inability to move a part of the body), although this may be a result of the surgery itself.
If the damage is slight, you may get better in a few days to a few weeks. Permanent damage to the peripheral nerves, which run between the spinal cord and the rest of the body, occurs in around 1 in 1,000 people having a general anaesthetic.
An allergic reaction to an anaesthetic medicine
Although an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can be severe, appropriate treatment is on hand to enable the best chance of dealing with this immediately and effectively.
It's not clear exactly how often anaesthetics cause anaphylaxis, but the best estimate is that a life-threatening allergic reaction occurs in 1 in 10,000 anaesthetics. More than 95 per cent of these will survive and generally recover well.
Death
If you're a healthy patient having non-emergency surgery, death is very rare at around 1 in 100,000 people having general anaesthetic. However, this may increase depending on certain factors.
Factors affecting risk of complications
Your risk of developing complications will depend on a number of factors, including:
your medical history – for example, whether you have any other serious medical conditions or illnesses
personal factors – for example, whether you smoke or are overweight; if you smoke, stopping several weeks before your operation will reduce your risk of having breathing problems, and losing weight will also help reduce your risk
the type of procedure – for example, whether it's a planned or an emergency procedure, or whether it's a major or minor procedure
the type of anaesthetic – local anaesthesia can have advantages over general anaesthesia in the right circumstances
Before your procedure, your anaesthetist will explain if there are any particular risks of developing possible complications.
In most cases, the benefits outweigh the risks. Any concerns you have should be discussed with your anaesthetist before surgery."
More information,"You can find out more about specific types of anaesthesia:
local anaesthesia
general anaesthesia
epidural
Also see the Royal College of Anaesthetists' patient information."
Anal fissure symptoms,"The most common symptoms of anal fissures are:
a sharp pain when you poo, often followed by a deep burning pain that may last several hours
bleeding when you poo – most people notice a small amount of bright red blood either in their poo or on the toilet paper"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you think you have an anal fissure.
Do not let embarrassment stop you seeking help. Anal fissures are a common problem GPs are used to dealing with.
Most anal fissures get better without treatment, but a GP will want to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as piles (haemorrhoids).
They can also tell you about self-help measures and treatments that can relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of fissures coming back."
Diagnosing anal fissures,"The GP will ask you about your symptoms and the type of pain you have been experiencing. They may also ask about your toilet habits.
They'll usually be able to see the fissure by gently parting your buttocks.
A digital rectal examination, where a GP inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your bottom to feel for abnormalities, is not usually used to diagnose anal fissures as it's likely to be painful.
The GP may refer you for specialist assessment if they think something serious may be causing your fissure.
This may include a more thorough examination of your bottom carried out using anaesthetic to minimise pain.
Occasionally, a measurement of anal sphincter pressure may be taken for fissures that have not responded to simple treatments.
The anal sphincter is the ring of muscles that open and close the anus."
What causes anal fissures?,"Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal, the last part of the large intestine.
Most cases occur in people who have constipation, when a particularly hard or large poo tears the lining of the anal canal.
Other possible causes of anal fissures include:
persistent diarrhoea
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
pregnancy and childbirth
occasionally, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as syphilis or herpes, which can infect and damage the anal canal
having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles, which can increase the tension in your anal canal, making it more susceptible to tearing
In many cases, no clear cause can be identified."
Treatment for anal fissure from a GP,"A GP can prescribe medicine to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process.
This can include laxatives to help you poo more easily and painkilling ointment that you put directly on your anus.
Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medicine have not helped.
Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures, but it does carry a small risk of complications, such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence).
Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment.
But they can easily come back if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated.
In some people, symptoms from anal fissures last 6 weeks or more (chronic anal fissures)."
How to ease symptoms of anal fissure,"Adopting some simple self-help measures can make going to the toilet easier.
This will allow existing fissures to heal, as well as reduce your chances of developing new fissures in the future.
Self-help measures for avoiding constipation include:
plenty of fibre in your diet, such as fruit and vegetables and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice – adults should aim to eat at least 30g of fibre a day
staying well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids
not ignoring the urge to poo – this can cause your poo to dry out and become harder to pass
exercising regularly – you should aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week
You can help soothe the pain by taking simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, or by soaking your bottom in a warm bath several times a day, particularly after a bowel movement."
Who's affected,"Anal fissures are quite common, with around 1 in every 10 people affected at some point in their life.
They affect both sexes equally and people of all ages can get them.
But children and young adults between 15 and 40 years of age are more likely to get anal fissures."
Symptoms of an anal fistula,"Symptoms of an anal fistula include:
skin irritation around the anus
a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down, move around, poo or cough
smelly discharge from near your anus
passing pus or blood when you poo
swelling and redness around your anus and a high temperature if you also have an abscess
difficulty controlling bowel movements (bowel incontinence) in some cases
The end of the fistula might be visible as a hole in the skin near your anus, although this may be difficult for you to see yourself."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have persistent symptoms of an anal fistula. They'll ask about your symptoms and whether you have any bowel conditions.
They may also ask to examine your anus and gently insert a finger inside it (rectal examination) to check for signs of a fistula.
If the GP thinks you might have a fistula, they can refer you to a specialist called a colorectal surgeon for further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most suitable treatment.
Tests you may have include:
a further physical and rectal examination
a proctoscopy, where a special telescope with a light on the end is used to look inside your anus
an ultrasound scan, MRI scan or CT scan"
When to get medical help,"The GP will look at the skin around the opening of your bottom (anus) to check for signs of an anal fistula.
They may also ask you if they can do a rectal examination. This involves gently inserting a gloved finger into your bottom.
If the GP thinks you have an anal fistula, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests.
Tests you may have include:
using a thin tube with a light at one end to look inside your bottom – this procedure is called a proctoscopy
scans, such as an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan"
Causes of anal fistulas,"Most anal fistulas develop after an anal abscess. You can get one if the abscess does not heal properly after the pus has drained away.
Less common causes of anal fistulas include:
Crohn's disease – a long-term condition where the digestive system becomes inflamed
diverticulitis – infection of the small pouches that can stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon)
hidradenitis suppurativa – a long-term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring
infection with tuberculosis (TB) or HIV
a complication of surgery near the anus"
Treatments for an anal fistula,"Anal fistulas usually require surgery as they rarely heal if left untreated.
The main options include:
a fistulotomy – a procedure that involves cutting open the whole length of the fistula so it heals into a flat scar
seton procedures – where a piece of surgical thread called a seton is placed in the fistula and left there for several weeks to help it heal before a further procedure is carried out to treat it
All the procedures have different benefits and risks. You can discuss this with the surgeon.
Many people do not need to stay in hospital overnight after surgery, although some may need to stay in hospital for a few days.
Find out more about treating an anal fistula"
Common causes of anal pain,"Anal pain has many different causes.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what is causing anal pain. Do not self-diagnose, see a GP if you're worried.
Common causes of anal pain and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pooing less than normal for you and pain when pooing Constipation
Itchy anus, feeling a lump around the anus, blood on the paper after wiping Piles (haemorrhoids)
Sharp pain when pooing, burning pain after doing a poo and blood on the paper after wiping Anal fissures
Constant throbbing pain, pus and blood on the paper after wiping, high temperature Anal fistulas and abscesses
Less often, anal pain can be caused by something else like a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or fungal infection. Rarely, it can be a sign of something serious like anal cancer."
How you can ease or prevent anal pain,"Do
drink lots of fluid and eat plenty of fibre to keep your poo soft
exercise regularly
wipe your bottom with damp toilet paper
take paracetamol
take a warm bath to ease itching and pain
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
Don’t
do not scratch around your anus
do not ignore the urge to poo
do not push too hard when pooing
do not use fragranced products, such as shower gels or soaps around your anus
do not eat spicy food or drink alcohol and caffeine
do not lift or carry anything heavy
do not take ibuprofen if your anus is bleeding
A pharmacist can help with anal pain
A pharmacist can recommend medicines to reduce constipation and anal pain such as:
painkillers like ibuprofen or paracetamol
creams or suppositories (medicines you put into your bottom) to ease itching, pain and swelling
medicines that help make it easier to poo (laxatives)
Many pharmacies have private areas if you do not want to be overheard.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for anal pain,"Treatment for anal pain depends on what's causing it.
A GP will examine you and may prescribe:
a cream or ointment to ease your pain
laxatives to help you poo more easily
antibiotics if you have an infection
The GP may also recommend changes to your diet or arrange for tests to look for a cause of the anal pain.
Sometimes surgery or other treatments may be needed if the pain is caused by severe anal fissures, piles or fistulas."
Check if it's anaphylaxis,"Symptoms of anaphylaxis happen very quickly.
They usually start within minutes of coming into contact with something you're allergic to, such as a food, medicine or insect sting.
Symptoms include:
swelling of your throat and tongue
difficulty breathing or breathing very fast
difficulty swallowing, tightness in your throat or a hoarse voice
wheezing, coughing or noisy breathing
feeling tired or confused
feeling faint, dizzy or fainting
skin that feels cold to the touch
blue, grey or pale skin, lips or tongue – if you have brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet
You may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy."
What to do if you have anaphylaxis,"Follow these steps if you think you or someone you're with is having an anaphylactic reaction:
Use an adrenaline auto-injector (such as an EpiPen) if you have one – instructions are included on the side of the injector.
Call 999 for an ambulance and say that you think you're having an anaphylactic reaction.
Lie down – you can raise your legs, and if you're struggling to breathe, raise your shoulders or sit up slowly (if you're pregnant, lie on your left side).
If you have been stung by an insect, try to remove the sting if it's still in the skin.
If your symptoms have not improved after 5 minutes, use a 2nd adrenaline auto-injector.
Do not stand or walk at any time, even if you feel better."
Treatment for anaphylaxis,"Anaphylaxis needs to be treated in hospital immediately.
Treatments can include:
adrenaline given by an injection or drip in your vein
oxygen
fluids given by a drip in your vein
You'll usually stay in hospital for around 2 to 12 hours, but you may need to stay longer.
Before you leave hospital, you'll be given 2 adrenaline auto-injectors to keep in case you have another anaphylactic reaction.
An adrenaline auto-injector is a special device for injecting adrenaline yourself. You'll be told how and when to use it.
You may also be referred to an allergy specialist for tests."
Things you can do to help prevent anaphylaxis,"There are some things you can do to help prevent anaphylaxis or prepare for if it happens.
Do
avoid the food, medicine or thing that you're allergic to – for example, if you have a food allergy, check food labels carefully and tell staff at restaurants and cafes about your allergy
carry 2 adrenaline auto-injectors with you at all times

Causes of anaphylaxis,"Anaphylaxis happens when your body has a serious reaction to something you're allergic to.
Allergies that can sometimes cause anaphylaxis include:
foods such as nuts, cows' milk, eggs, fish or sesame seeds
medicines such as antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
insect stings such as wasp and bee stings
anaesthetics
latex (a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms)
Sometimes it's not known what caused an anaphylactic reaction."
What causes AIS?,"AIS is caused by a genetic alteration that is passed along the female line to the child.
Although people with AIS have XY (usual male pattern) chromosomes, the body does not respond to testosterone (the sex hormone) fully or at all. This prevents the sex development of a typical male.
A penis does not form or is underdeveloped. This means the child's genitals may develop as female, or are underdeveloped as male.
The child may have fully or partially undescended testicles. But there will be no womb or ovaries.
Women who carry the genetic alteration will not have AIS themselves, but there's a 1 in 4 chance each child they have will be born with AIS.
Read more about the causes of AIS."
Types of AIS,"There are 2 main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone.
These are:
complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) – where testosterone has no effect on sex development, so the genitals are entirely female
partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) – where testosterone has some effect on sex development, so the genitals are often not as expected for boys or girls
PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different.
CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look like those of any other girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods do not start and pubic and underarm hair does not develop.
Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS."
Living with AIS,"Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care.
The team will help you understand your child's sex development. In the case of PAIS, they will talk to you about why they recommend raising your child as a boy or a girl.
Children with PAIS will be brought up either as girls or boys, depending mostly on the extent to which their body responds to hormones (androgens), including testosterone.
You and the specialist team will decide together what you think is in the best interests of your child.
Most children with CAIS are raised as girls.
Once you have learned about your child's sex development, and understand how their body will grow and develop, the specialist team can explain the treatment options your child might have in the future.
Read more about how AIS is treated."
Support and advice,"You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS.
Children may not need psychological support while they're very young. But they will need to grow up understanding their body and how it works.
You'll be given advice about talking to your child about AIS at all ages.
You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as DSD Families."
Gender identity and gender dysphoria,"Most children with AIS continue to feel they are the gender they grew up with.
In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity does not match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria.
People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex or as non-binary.
They may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity or how they choose to identify.
If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about issues of gender identity."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat AIS. You can opt out of the register at any time."
About brain aneurysms,"The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm.
Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture).
This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms.
Symptoms of a burst brain aneurysm include:
a sudden agonising headache – it's been described as a ""thunderclap headache"", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before
a stiff neck
sickness and vomiting
pain on looking at light
Find out more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm
A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency.
If you think someone has had a brain haemorrhage, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance."
How brain aneurysms are treated,"If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future.
Most aneurysms do not rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high.
Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have.
If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils (coiling) or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip (surgical clipping).
The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured.
If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm.
You may also be given medicine to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke."
Why brain aneurysms develop,"Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified.
These include: 
smoking
high blood pressure
a family history of brain aneurysms
In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth."
Who's affected,"It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected.
Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people.
The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 15,000 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year.
Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40.
Women tend to be affected more commonly than men."
Preventing brain aneurysms,"The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid activities that could damage your blood vessels.
Things to avoid include:
smoking
eating a high-fat diet
not controlling high blood pressure
being overweight or obese
Find out more about preventing aneurysms"
Characteristics of Angelman syndrome,"A child with Angelman syndrome will begin to show signs of delayed development at around 6 to 12 months of age, such as being unable to sit unsupported or make babbling noises.
Later, they may not speak at all or may only be able to say a few words. However, most children with Angelman syndrome will be able to communicate using gestures, signs or other systems.
The movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking because of issues with balance and co-ordination (ataxia). Their arms may tremble or make jerky movements, and their legs may be stiff.
Several distinctive behaviours are associated with Angelman syndrome, although a child with the condition may not have all of these behaviours. They include:
frequent laughter and smiling, often with little stimulus
being easily excitable, often flapping the hands
being restless (hyperactive)
having a short attention span
trouble sleeping and needing less sleep than other children
a particular fascination with water
By around 2 years of age, a small head which may also be flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) may be noticeable in some children with Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome may also start to have seizures or fits around this age.
Other possible features of the syndrome include:
tendency to stick the tongue out
crossed eyes (strabismus)
skin, hair and eyes that are paler than other family members
a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth
a side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis)
walking with arms in the air
Some young babies with Angelman syndrome may have difficulties feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing. In such cases, they may need to be fed through a feeding tube. Babies with Angelman syndrome may need to be treated for reflux."
Causes of Angelman syndrome,"In most cases of Angelman syndrome, the child's parents do not have the condition and the genetic difference responsible for the syndrome happens by chance around the time of conception.
Angelman syndrome usually happens when the gene known as UBE3A is either missing or not working properly. A gene is a single unit of genetic material (DNA) that acts as an instruction for the way an individual is made and develops.
Usually a child gets 2 copies of this gene, one from each parent, but only the gene from the mother is active.
Most cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by the child not getting a copy of the UBE3A gene from its mother, or the gene not working. This means there's no active copy of the gene in the child's brain.
In a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome happens when a child gets 2 inactive copies of the gene from their father, rather than 1 from each parent.
Sometimes the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. Most children in these unexplained cases have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes."
Diagnosing Angelman syndrome,"Angelman syndrome may be suspected if a child's development is delayed and they have the syndrome's distinctive characteristics.
A blood test is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several genetic tests will be done on the blood sample. These tests look for:
any chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes that are missing
changes in the mother's or father's UBE3A gene that they may have passed on
changes in the child's UBE3A gene that would stop it from working
For each child with Angelman syndrome, it's important to know the genetic change that caused the condition. This helps to determine your chance of having another child with Angelman syndrome.
Most children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 9 months to 6 years, when physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent.
If your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you will be able to talk to a genetic doctor about what support they might need."
Managing Angelman syndrome,"Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids:
anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures
physiotherapy may improve posture, balance and walking ability; it's also important to prevent permanent stiffening of the joints as people with Angelman syndrome get older
communication therapy may help them develop non-verbal language skills, such as sign language and using visual aids, or ways to help them communicate such as Signalong, Makaton or PECS; using iPad applications and similar tablet devices may also help
behavioural therapy may be recommended to help overcome behaviours you find hard to manage, such as hyperactivity and a short attention span
In later childhood, the seizures usually improve, although they may return in adulthood. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and may sleep better.
Most people with the syndrome will have learning disability and limited speech throughout their life. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen.
People with Angelman syndrome usually have good general health and are often able to improve their communication and acquire new skills.
While there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, research into treatments is being done in other countries. There are also clinical trials looking at treatment for some of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome, such as seizures.

Help and support,"AngelmanUK is a charity providing information and support for parents and carers of people with Angelman syndrome.
You can call their helpline (0300 999 0102) to speak with parents of people with Angelman syndrome, who can offer you advice and support.
The Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST) is a charity that provides information about Angelman syndrome.
The website includes a section for parents who have a child who has recently been diagnosed with Angelman syndrome."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child has Angelman syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of angina,"The main symptom of angina is chest pain.
Chest pain caused by angina usually:
feels tight, dull or heavy – it may spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back
is triggered by physical exertion or stress
stops within a few minutes of resting
Sometimes there might be other symptoms, like feeling sick or breathless."
When to get medical help,"If you have not been diagnosed with angina, get an urgent GP appointment if you have an attack of chest pain that stops within a few minutes of resting.
They can check if it might be a heart problem and refer you to a hospital for tests.
Find out more about how angina is diagnosed
Call 999 for an ambulance if you have chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes. This could be a heart attack."
Types,"There are 2 main types of angina you can be diagnosed with:
stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting
unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting
Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina."
Treatment for angina,"You'll probably need to take several different medicines for the rest of your life.
You may be given medicine to:
treat attacks when they happen (only taken when needed)
prevent further attacks
reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes
If medicines are not suitable or do not help, an operation to improve blood flow to your heart muscles may be recommended."
Living with angina,"If it's well controlled, there's no reason why you cannot have a largely normal life with angina.
You can usually continue to do most of your normal activities.
You'll probably need to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as:
having a balanced diet
cutting down on alcohol
stopping smoking if you smoke
losing weight if you're overweight
exercising regularly – gentle exercises are usually safe
This can help reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes."
Causes of angina,"Angina is usually caused by the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscles becoming narrowed by a build-up of fatty substances.
This is called atherosclerosis.
Things that can increase your risk of atherosclerosis include:
an unhealthy diet
a lack of exercise
smoking
increasing age
a family history of atherosclerosis or heart problems
Angina can also be caused by other conditions affecting the heart and arteries."
Check if you have angioedema,"Angioedema is where a part of the body suddenly becomes swollen.
You'll usually have a raised, itchy rash (hives) if an allergic reaction has caused the swelling.
Areas of the body commonly affected include:
the face – particularly the lips, tongue and eyelids
the hands or feet
the genitals
Sometimes the bowel may also become swollen, which can cause stomach pain.
Less commonly, the throat can swell up, leading to breathing difficulties. This is a medical emergency and immediate treatment is needed."
Treatments for angioedema,"You may not need treatment for angioedema if the swelling is mild or it only affects a small area of your body.
If the swelling is severe or widespread, or if it affects your lips, tongue, or throat, you'll usually need emergency treatment in hospital.
Treatments for angioedema include:
identifying and avoiding the underlying cause – if a medicine is thought to be the cause, you may be given a different one to take instead
antihistamine medicine, such as cetirizine, fexofenadine or loratadine
steroid tablets, such as prednisolone
If you have a type of angioedema that keeps coming back (hereditary angioedema), you may also need medicine to stop this happening.
You may have regular reviews to check if your treatment is working.
If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, you may need to go back to hospital for further tests and treatment."
Types of angioedema,"Types of angioedema
Cause Type
Angioedema caused by an allergic reaction to certain foods, medicines or substances Acute allergic angioedema
A non-allergic reaction to a medicine, most commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Non-allergic angioedema
Long-term angioedema where the cause is unknown Idiopathic angioedema
A rare and potentially life-threatening type of angioedema that's often inherited from your parents Hereditary angioedema
A very rare type of angioedema that you can get if you have lymphoma (cancer), or a condition that affects the connective tissue, such as lupus Acquired angioedema"
Why angiography is used,"Angiography is used to check the health of your blood vessels and how blood flows through them.
It can help to diagnose or investigate several problems affecting blood vessels, including:
atherosclerosis – narrowing of the arteries, which could mean you're at risk of having a stroke or heart attack
peripheral arterial disease – reduced blood supply to the leg muscles
a brain aneurysm – a bulge in a blood vessel in your brain
angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles
blood clots or a pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the artery supplying your lungs
a blockage in the blood supply to your kidneys
Angiography may also be used to help plan treatment for some of these conditions."
What happens during angiography,"Angiography is done in a hospital X-ray or radiology department.
For the test:
you'll usually be awake, but may be given a medicine called a sedative to help you relax
you lie on an X-ray table and a small cut (incision) is made over 1 of your arteries, usually near your groin or wrist – local anaesthetic is used to numb the area where the cut is made
a very thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into the artery
the catheter is carefully guided to the area that's being examined (such as the heart)
a contrast agent (dye) is injected into the catheter
a series of X-rays are taken as contrast agent flows through your blood vessels
The test can take between 30 minutes and 2 hours. You'll usually be able to go home a few hours afterwards.
Read more about what happens before, during and after angiography."
Risks of angiography,"Angiography is generally a safe and painless procedure.
But for a few days or weeks afterwards it's common to have:
bruising
soreness
a very small lump or collection of blood near where the cut was made
There's also a very small risk of more serious complications, such as an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, a stroke or a heart attack.
Read more about the risks of angiography."
Types of angiography,"There are several different types of angiography, depending on which part of the body is being looked at.
Common types include:
coronary angiography – to check the heart and nearby blood vessels
cerebral angiography – to check the blood vessels in and around the brain
pulmonary angiography – to check the blood vessels supplying the lungs
renal angiography – to check the blood vessels supplying the kidneys
Occasionally, angiography may be done using scans instead of X-rays. These are called CT angiography or MRI angiography.
There's also a type of angiography that's used to check the eyes, called fluorescein angiography. It's different to the other types of angiography and is not covered in this topic."
When a coronary angioplasty is used,"Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries.
In some people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease.
If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress.
While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective.
Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack."
What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?,"In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.
If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future."
How a coronary angioplasty is performed,"A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out.
A thin, flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video.
When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed.
If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed.
A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week.
If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home.
Read more about: 
What happens during a coronary angioplasty
Recovering from a coronary angioplasty"
How safe is a coronary angioplasty?,"A coronary angioplasty is 1 of the most common types of treatment for the heart.
As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment.
The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as:
your age
your general health
whether you've had a heart attack
Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include:
excessive bleeding
a heart attack
a stroke
Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty."
Are there any alternatives?,"If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered.
This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries.
Read more about the alternatives to a coronary angioplasty."
What to do after animal or human bites,"There are some things you can do after being bitten by an animal or a person.
Do
clean the skin around the wound with soap and warm water – you can also use antiseptic, but try not to get it in the wound
try to remove any objects like teeth, hair or dirt from the wound using running water
gently squeeze the wound so it bleeds slightly (unless it's already bleeding) – this can help reduce the risk of infection
press a dry dressing or clean cloth firmly onto the wound to stop the bleeding if it's bleeding heavily
after cleaning the wound, gently pat it dry and cover it with a clean dressing
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease any pain and swelling – children under 16 should not take aspirin"
Treatments for animal and human bites,"If you've been bitten by an animal or person, a doctor or nurse will check the wound.
They may:
clean the bite thoroughly – if the wound is very dirty, some of the affected area may need to be removed to reduce the risk of infection
close the wound with stitches, sticky strips or special glue, or leave it open to heal
give you antibiotics to stop the wound becoming infected
check your risk of getting tetanus and rabies – you'll be given treatment to prevent these serious infections if needed
If you've been bitten by a person, you may also be offered a blood test to check for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV."
How you can ease ankle pain yourself,"If you see a GP about ankle pain, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest and raise your ankle when you can
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your ankle for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
wear wide comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
use soft insoles or heel pads in your shoes
wrap a bandage around your ankle to support it
try regular gentle stretching exercises
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
Don’t
do not walk or stand for long periods
do not wear high heels or tight pointy shoes
A pharmacist can help with ankle pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
insoles and pads for your shoes
if you need to see a GP

Common causes of ankle pain,"Ankle pain is often caused by exercising too much or wearing shoes that are too tight.
Your symptoms might also give you an idea of what's causing your ankle pain.
Possible symptoms and causes of ankle pain.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain, swelling, bruising, started after intense or repetitive exercise Sprained ankle
Pain in ankle and heel, pain in calf when standing on tiptoes Achilles tendonitis
Redness and swelling, dull aching pain Bursitis
Sudden sharp pain, swelling, a popping or snapping sound during the injury, difficulty walking, ankle at odd angle Broken ankle"
Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis,"The symptoms of AS can vary, but usually involve:
back pain and stiffness
pain and swelling in other parts of the body – caused by inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and inflammation where a tendon joins a bone (enthesitis)
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time.
In some people the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse.
Read about symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis."
When to seek medical advice,"You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.
If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints (rheumatologist) for further tests and any necessary treatment.
Further tests may include blood tests and imaging tests.
Read about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis."
Causes of ankylosing spondylitis,"It's not known what causes the condition, but there's thought to be a link with a particular gene variant known as HLA-B27.
Read about the causes of ankylosing spondylitis."
Treating ankylosing spondylitis,"There's no cure for AS and it's not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help delay its progression.
In most cases treatment involves a combination of:
exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness
physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility
medicine to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation – such as painkillers, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication and other forms of biological therapy
Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon.
Read about treating ankylosing spondylitis."
Complications of ankylosing spondylitis,"The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others it can get progressively worse over time.
Some people with AS are able to remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term.
However, some people eventually become severely disabled as a result of the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees.
With modern treatments, AS does not normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems.
For example, AS can lead to:
weakening of the bones (osteoporosis)
spinal fractures
cardiovascular disease – a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels
Read about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis.

Causes of lost or changed sense of smell,"Changes in sense of smell are most often caused by:
illnesses such as a cold, flu or COVID-19
sinusitis (sinus infection)
an allergy, like hay fever
growths in your nose (nasal polyps)
It can also be caused by some medicines and, rarely, by more serious conditions like Parkinson’s disease or epilepsy.
These problems can cause:
loss of smell (anosmia)
smelling things that are not there (phantosmia), like smoke or burnt toast
reduced sense of smell (hyposmia)
changes to how things smell (parosmia)
It's also common to lose some of your sense of smell as you get older."
Cleaning inside your nose can help,"Rinsing the inside of your nose with a saltwater solution may help if your sense of smell is affected by an infection or allergy.
You can make a saltwater solution at home.
How to clean your nose with a saltwater solution
Some pharmacies sell sachets you can use to make a saltwater solution and devices to help you rinse your nose.
Find a pharmacy
Information:
If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better."
Treatment for lost or changed sense of smell,"Your sense of smell may go back to normal in a few weeks or months.
Treating the cause might help. For example, steroid nasal sprays or drops might help if you have sinusitis or nasal polyps.
Sometimes changes in sense of smell cannot be treated and may be permanent.
A treatment called smell training can help some people."
When antacids are used,"Antacids may help if you have:
indigestion
heartburn, acid reflux or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
a stomach ulcer
gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
They can quickly relieve your symptoms for a few hours. But they do not treat the underlying cause and long-term use is not recommended.
Speak to a GP if you find you need to take antacids regularly."
Common types of antacids,"Many different types of antacid are available. Some are sold under a brand name and others are named after their main ingredient. Brands include Gaviscon (alginic acid) and Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate).
Ingredients to look for include:
aluminium hydroxide
magnesium carbonate
magnesium trisilicate
magnesium hydroxide
calcium carbonate
sodium bicarbonate
Some antacids also contain other medicines, such as an alginate (which coats your gullet with a protective layer) and simeticone (which reduces flatulence)."
How and when to take antacids,"Check the instructions on the packet or leaflet to see how much antacid to take and how often. This depends on the exact medicine you're taking.
Antacids should be used when you have symptoms or think you will get them soon – for most people, the best time to take them is with or soon after meals, and just before going to bed.
Remember that doses for children may be lower than for adults.
Contact a GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111, if you take too much of the medicine and start to feel unwell."
"Taking antacids with food, alcohol and other medicines","It's best to take antacids with food or soon after eating because this is when you're most likely to get indigestion or heartburn.
The effect of the medicine may also last longer if taken with food.
Antacids can affect how well other medicines work, so do not take other medicines within 2 to 4 hours of taking an antacid.
You can drink alcohol while taking antacids, but alcohol can irritate your stomach and make your symptoms worse."
Side effects of antacids,"Antacids do not usually have many side effects if they're only taken occasionally and at the recommended dose.
But sometimes they can cause:
diarrhoea or constipation
flatulence (wind)
stomach cramps
feeling sick or vomiting
These should pass once you stop taking the medicine.
Speak to a pharmacist or a GP if side effects do not improve or are troublesome. You may need to switch to another medicine."
Who may not be able to take antacids,"Antacids are safe for most people to take, but they're not suitable for everyone.
Speak to a pharmacist or a GP for advice first if you:
are pregnant or breastfeeding – most antacids are considered safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding, but always get advice first. Products containing sodium bicarbonate or magnesium trisilicate are not recommended in pregnancy
are looking for a medicine for a child under 12 years of age – some antacids are not recommended for children
have liver disease, kidney disease or heart failure – some antacids may not be safe if you have one of these problems
have an illness that means you need to control how much salt (sodium) is in your diet, such as high blood pressure or cirrhosis – some antacids contain high levels of sodium, which could make you unwell
are taking other medicines – antacids can interfere with other medicines and may need be avoided or taken at a different time"
When antibiotics are needed,"Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that:
are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics
could infect others
could take too long to clear without treatment
carry a risk of more serious complications
People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis.
Read more about when antibiotics are used and why antibiotics are not routinely used to treat infections."
How to take antibiotics,"Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist.
Antibiotics can come as:
tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink – these can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body
creams, lotions, sprays and drops – these are often used to treat skin infections and eye or ear infections
injections – these can be given as an injection or through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are used for more serious infections
Missing a dose of antibiotics
If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, check the patient information leaflet that came with your medicine to find out what to do. If you're not sure, speak to a pharmacist or a GP.
In most cases, you can take the dose you missed as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal.
But if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
Accidentally taking an extra dose
There's an increased risk of side effects if you take 2 doses closer together than recommended.
Accidentally taking 1 extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm.
But it will increase your chances of getting side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick.
If you accidentally take more than 1 extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or you get severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible."
Side effects of antibiotics,"As with any medicine, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics do not cause problems if they're used properly and serious side effects are rare.
The common side effects include:
being sick
feeling sick
bloating and indigestion
diarrhoea
Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and another type of antibiotic called cephalosporins.
In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency.
Call 999 or go to A&E now if:
you get a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin
you're wheezing
you get tightness in the chest or throat
you have trouble breathing or talking
your mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat start swelling
You could be having a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.
Read more about the side effects of antibiotics."
Considerations and interactions,"Some antibiotics are not suitable for people with certain medical problems, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Tell your healthcare professional if you're pregnant or breastfeeding so they can prescribe the most suitable antibiotic for you.
Only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you – never ""borrow"" them from a friend or family member.
Some antibiotics do not mix well with other medicines, such as the contraceptive pill and alcohol.
Read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP.
Read more about how antibiotics interact with other medicines."
Types of antibiotics,"There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be classified into 6 groups.
Penicillins (such as penicillin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin) – widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections
Cephalosporins (such as cefalexin) – used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as sepsis and meningitis
Aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) – tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as sepsis, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they're usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections
Tetracyclines (such as tetracycline, doxycycline and lymecycline) – can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat acne and a skin condition called rosacea
Macrolides (such as azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin) – can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or as an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria
Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) – are broad-spectrum antibiotics that were once used to treat a wide range of infections, especially respiratory and urinary tract infections; these antibiotics are no longer used routinely because of the risk of serious side effects
Other antibiotics include chloramphenicol (used for eye and ear infections), fusidic acid (used for skin and eye infections), and nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim (used for urinary tract infections).

Types of anticoagulants,"The most commonly prescribed anticoagulant is warfarin.
Newer types of anticoagulants are also available and are becoming increasingly common. These include:
rivaroxaban (Xarelto)
dabigatran (Pradaxa)
apixaban (Eliquis)
edoxaban (Lixiana)
Warfarin and the newer alternatives are taken as tablets or capsules. There's also an anticoagulant called heparin that can be given by injection. Read more about heparin on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website."
When anticoagulants are used,"If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through a blood vessel, the affected part of the body will become starved of oxygen and will stop working properly.
Depending on where the clot forms, this can lead to serious problems such as:
strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (""mini-strokes"")
heart attacks
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
pulmonary embolism
Treatment with anticoagulants may be recommended if your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing one of these problems. This may be because you've had blood clots in the past or you've been diagnosed with a condition such as atrial fibrillation that can cause blood clots to form.
You may also be prescribed an anticoagulant if you've recently had surgery, as the period of rest and inactivity you need during your recovery can increase your risk of developing a blood clot.
Read more about when anticoagulants are used."
How to take anticoagulants,"Your doctor or nurse should tell you how much of your anticoagulant medicine to take and when to take it. 
Most people need to take their tablets or capsules once or twice a day with water or food.
The length of time you need to keep taking your medicine for depends on why it's been prescribed. In many cases, treatment will be lifelong.
If you're unsure how to take your medicine, or are worried that you missed a dose or have taken too much, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it or ask your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist what to do. You can also call NHS 111 for advice.
Read more about anticoagulant dosage."
Things to consider when taking anticoagulants,"There are several things you need to be aware of when taking anticoagulant medicines.
If you're going to have surgery or a test such as an endoscopy, make sure your doctor or surgeon is aware that you're taking anticoagulants, as you may have to stop taking them for a short time.
Speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as some medicines can affect how your anticoagulant works.
If you're taking warfarin, you'll also need to avoid making significant changes to what you normally eat and drink, as this can affect your medicine.
Most anticoagulant medicines aren't suitable for pregnant women. Speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic if you become pregnant or are planning to try for a baby while taking anticoagulants.
Read more about things to consider when taking anticoagulants."
Side effects of anticoagulants,"Like all medicines, there's a risk of experiencing side effects while taking anticoagulants.
The main side effect is that you can bleed too easily, which can cause problems such as:
passing blood in your urine
passing blood when you poo or having black poo
severe bruising
prolonged nosebleeds
bleeding gums
vomiting blood or coughing up blood
heavy periods in women
For most people, the benefits of taking anticoagulants will outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.
Read more about the side effects of anticoagulants."
Infections antifungals can treat,"Fungal infections commonly treated with antifungals include:
ringworm
athlete's foot
fungal nail infection
vaginal thrush
some types of severe dandruff
Some fungal infections can grow inside the body and need to be treated in hospital.
Examples include:
aspergillosis, which affects the lungs
fungal meningitis, which affects the brain
You're more at risk of getting one of these more serious fungal infections if you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you're taking medicines to suppress your immune system."
Types of antifungal medicines,"You can get antifungal medicines as:
a cream, gel, ointment or spray
a capsule, tablet or liquid
an injection
a pessary: a small and soft tablet you put inside the vagina
Common names for antifungal medicines include:
clotrimazole (Canesten)
econazole
miconazole
terbinafine (Lamisil)
fluconazole (Diflucan)
ketoconazole (Daktarin)
nystatin (Nystan)
amphotericin"
How antifungal medicines work,"Antifungal medicines work by either:
killing the fungus
preventing the fungus from growing"
When to see a pharmacist or GP,"See a pharmacist or GP if you think you have a fungal infection. They can advise you on which antifungal medicine is best for you.
If you take too much antifungal medicine, call 111 or speak to a pharmacist or GP.
If you're advised to go to hospital, take the medicine's packaging with you so the healthcare professionals who treat you know what you've taken."
Things to consider when using antifungal medicines,"Before taking antifungal medicines, speak to a pharmacist or GP about:
any existing conditions or allergies that may affect your treatment for fungal infection
the possible side effects of antifungal medicines
whether the antifungal medicine may interact with other medicines you may already be taking
whether your antifungal medicine is suitable to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding – many are not suitable
You can also check the patient information leaflet that comes with your antifungal medicine for more information."
Side effects of antifungal medicines,"Antifungal medicines may cause side effects. These are usually mild and do not last long.
They can include:
itching or burning
redness
feeling sick
tummy (abdominal) pain
diarrhoea
a rash
Occasionally, antifungal medicines may cause a more severe reaction, such as:
an allergic reaction – your face, neck or tongue may swell and you may have difficulty breathing
a severe skin reaction – such as peeling or blistering skin
liver damage (very rarely) – you may have loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, jaundice, dark pee or pale poo, tiredness or weakness
Stop using the medicine if you have these severe side effects, and see a GP or pharmacist to find an alternative.
If you're having difficulty breathing, go to A&E or call 999."
Reporting side effects,"If you think a medicine has made you unwell, you can report this side effect through the Yellow Card Scheme."
Antifungal medicines for children,"Some antifungal medicines can be used to treat children and babies – for example, miconazole oral gel can be used for oral thrush in babies.
But different doses are usually needed for children of different ages. Speak to a pharmacist or GP for more advice."
Types of antihistamine,"There are many types of antihistamine.
They're usually divided into 2 main groups:
antihistamines that make you feel sleepy – such as chlorphenamine (Piriton), cinnarizine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and promethazine
non-drowsy antihistamines that are less likely to make you feel sleepy – such as acrivastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine
They also come in several different forms – including tablets, capsules, liquids, syrups, creams, lotions, gels, eyedrops and nasal sprays.
Which type is best?
There's not much evidence to suggest any particular antihistamine is better than any other at relieving allergy symptoms.
Some people find certain types work well for them and others do not. You may need to try several types to find one that works for you.
Non-drowsy antihistamines are generally the best option, as they're less likely to make you feel sleepy. But types that make you feel sleepy may be better if your symptoms stop you sleeping.
Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're unsure which medicine to try as not all antihistamines are suitable for everyone."
How to take antihistamines,"Take your medicine as advised by the pharmacist or doctor, or as described in the leaflet that comes with it.
Before taking an antihistamine, you should know:
how to take it – including whether it needs to be taken with water or food, or how to use it correctly (if eyedrops or a nasal spray)
how much to take (the dose) – this can vary depending on things such as your age and weight
when to take it – including how many times a day you can take it and when to take it (some types should be taken before bedtime)
how long to take it for – some types can be used for a long time, but some are only recommended for a few days
what to do if you miss a dose or take too much (overdose)
The advice varies depending on the exact medicine you're taking. If you're not sure how to take your medicine, ask a pharmacist."
Side effects of antihistamines,"Like all medicines, antihistamines can cause side effects.
Side effects of antihistamines that make you drowsy can include:
sleepiness (drowsiness) and reduced co-ordination, reaction speed and judgement – do not drive or use machinery after taking these antihistamines
dry mouth
blurred vision
difficulty peeing
Side effects of non-drowsy antihistamines can include:
headache
dry mouth
feeling sick
drowsiness – although this is less common than with older types of antihistamines
Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects and advice about when to get medical help.
If you think your medicine has caused an unwanted side effect, you can report it through the Yellow Card Scheme."
"Taking antihistamines with other medicines, food or alcohol","Speak to a pharmacist or GP before taking antihistamines if you're already taking other medicines.
There may be a risk the medicines do not mix, which could stop either from working properly or increase the risk of side effects.
Examples of medicines that could cause problems if taken with antihistamines include some types of:
antidepressants
stomach ulcer or indigestion medicines
cough and cold remedies that also contain an antihistamine
Try not to drink alcohol while taking an antihistamine, particularly if it's a type that makes you drowsy, as it can increase the chances of it making you feel sleepy.
Food and other drinks do not affect most antihistamines, but check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to make sure."
Who can take antihistamines,"Most people can safely take antihistamines.
But speak to a pharmacist or GP for advice if you:
are pregnant or breastfeeding
are looking for a medicine for a young child
are an older person
are taking other medicines 
have an underlying health condition, such as heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease or epilepsy
Some antihistamines may not be suitable in these cases. A pharmacist or doctor can recommend one that's best for you.
Loratadine is usually recommended if you need to take an antihistamine in pregnancy. Loratadine or cetirizine are usually OK to take while breastfeeding.
Always check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it's safe for you before taking it or giving it to your child."
How antihistamines work,"Antihistamines block the effects of a substance called histamine in your body.
Histamine is normally released when your body detects something harmful, such as an infection. It causes blood vessels to expand and the skin to swell, which helps protect the body.
But in people with allergies, the body mistakes something harmless – such as pollen, animal hair or house dust – for a threat and produces histamine. The histamine causes an allergic reaction with unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watering eyes, a running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.
Antihistamines help stop this happening if you take them before you come into contact with the substance you're allergic to. Or they can reduce the severity of symptoms if you take them afterwards."
Find out more about your medicine,"The leaflet that comes in the packet with your medicine will have detailed information about it, including how to take it and what side effects you might get.

What causes antiphospholipid syndrome?,"APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake.
In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies.
These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot.
It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies.
As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part.
Find out more about the causes of APS"
Who's affected,"APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies.
But most people are diagnosed with APS between 20 and 50 years of age, and it affects 3 to 5 times as many women as men.
It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition."
Diagnosing APS,"Diagnosing APS can sometimes be difficult, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis.
This means blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition.
Find out more about diagnosing APS"
How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated,"Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed.
An anticoagulant medicine, such as warfarin, or an antiplatelet, such as low-dose aspirin, is usually prescribed.
These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming, but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself.
Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy.
With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy.
Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives.
But a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment.
Find out more about treating APS"
Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome,"In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).
CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants.

Signs of antisocial personality disorder,"A person with antisocial personality disorder may:
exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others
lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress
behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour
have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships
be unable to control their anger
lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes
blame others for problems in their lives
repeatedly break the law
A person with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, such as truancy (not going to school), delinquency (for example, committing crimes or substance misuse), and other disruptive and aggressive behaviours."
Who develops antisocial personality disorder?,"Antisocial personality disorder affects more men than women.
It's not known why some people develop antisocial personality disorder, but both genetics and traumatic childhood experiences, such as child abuse or neglect, are thought to play a role.
A person with antisocial personality disorder will have often grown up in difficult family circumstances. 
One or both parents may misuse alcohol, and parental conflict and harsh, inconsistent parenting are common.
As a result of these problems, social services may become involved with the child's care.
These types of difficulties in childhood will often lead to behavioural problems during adolescence and adulthood."
Effects of antisocial personality disorder,"Criminal behaviour is a key feature of antisocial personality disorder, and there's a high risk that someone with the disorder will commit crimes and be imprisoned at some point in their life.
Men with antisocial personality disorder have been found to be 3 to 5 times more likely than women to misuse alcohol and drugs than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide.
People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless."
Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder,"To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person will usually have a history of conduct personality disorder before the age of 15.
Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous detailed psychological assessment.
A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least 3 of the following criteria behaviours apply:
repeatedly breaking the law
repeatedly being deceitful
being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead
being irritable and aggressive
having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others
being consistently irresponsible
lack of remorse
These signs are not part of a schizophrenic or manic episode – they're part of a person's everyday personality and behaviour.
This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20s. It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40s."
Treating antisocial personality disorder,"In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated.
Evidence suggests behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain. 
But antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat.
A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court.
The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse.
The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care.
Sometimes, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved.
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): management and prevention of antisocial personality disorder
Talking therapies
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder.
It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.
Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.
The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour.
Democratic therapeutic communities (DTC)
Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons.
DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs.
It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community.
There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work.
The recommended length of treatment is 18 months, as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice.
Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups, and be subject to the democratic process.
Read more about DTC and working with offenders with personality disorder on GOV.UK
Medicine
There's little evidence to support the use of medicine for treating antisocial personality disorder, but certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines may be helpful in some instances.
Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms.

Depending on the cause, the GP might:
suggest trying things to ease it yourself
prescribe medicine, such as stronger steroid creams, or ointments
Important
Tell the GP immediately if a cream, ointment or other medicine makes the itching worse."
Sexual health clinics can help with an itchy bottom,"You can also go to a sexual health clinic if you think your itchy bottom might be caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) – for example, if you've had unprotected sex. They can provide the same treatments you would get from a GP.
Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment.
Find a sexual health clinic"
Causes of an itchy bottom,"There's not always a clear cause of an itchy bottom. If it gets better quickly, it might have been caused by something that does not need treatment, like sweating a lot in hot weather.
If it lasts longer, you might be able to get an idea of the cause from any other symptoms you have. See a GP if you're worried or if your symptoms keep coming back.
Itchy bottom and possible causes
Other symptoms with itchy bottom Possible causes
Gets worse at night, worms in poo (they look like small pieces of thread)
Threadworms, especially in children
Bright red blood when pooing
Piles (haemorrhoids)
Poo leaking or pooing you cannot control
Diarrhoea or bowel incontinence
Sores, swelling or irritation
Fungal infection or a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
Itching elsewhere on the body
Skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis
While using long-term medicine
Side effects of steroid creams, antibiotics, some gels and ointments for haemorrhoids or anal fissures, and peppermint oil
Important
It's unusual for an itchy bottom to be caused by something serious. But rarely, it may be a sign of conditions like diabetes or anal cancer, so it's important to get it checked by a GP."
Symptoms of anxiety in children and young people,"Signs to look out for in your child are:
finding it hard to concentrate
not sleeping, or waking in the night with bad dreams
eating more or less than usual
quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts
constantly worrying or having negative thoughts
feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often
always crying
being clingy, especially in young children
complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell
Separation anxiety is common in younger children, whereas older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school or have social anxiety."
How to help your anxious child,"If your child is having problems with anxiety, there's plenty you can do to help.
Above all, it's important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries.
Read more about anxiety in children, including self-help tips for parents of anxious children.
Many children at different ages may have anxieties that will go away after a while, with your reassurance.
However, it's a good idea to seek professional help or reassurance yourself if your child is constantly anxious and:
it's not getting better, or is getting worse
self-help is not working
it's affecting their school or family life, or their friendships"
Where to get help for anxiety,"An appointment with a GP is a good place to start.
You can talk to the GP on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you.
If the GP thinks your child could have an anxiety disorder, they may refer them for an assessment with your local children and young people's mental health services (CYPMHS).
Specialist CYPMHS are NHS mental health services that focus on the needs of children and young people. CYPMHS workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems, including anxiety.
If your child does not want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help directly from a local youth counselling service. For more information, visit Youth Access. You may also want to talk to your child's school about their anxiety and any support they need."
Treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people,"The type of treatment offered will depend on your child's age and the cause of their anxiety.
Counselling can help your child understand what's making them anxious and allow them to work through the situation.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their anxiety by changing the way they think and behave. This could be in person or as self-help online.
Anxiety medicines may be offered to your child if their anxiety is severe or does not get better with talking therapies. They're usually only prescribed by doctors who specialise in children and young people's mental health."
What causes anxiety disorders in children and young people,"Having a close family member with anxiety may increase your child's chance of having it too.
Children can also pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people.
Some children develop anxiety after stressful events, such as:
frequently moving house or school
parents fighting or arguing
the death of a close relative or friend
becoming seriously ill or getting injured in an accident
school-related issues like exams or bullying
being abused or neglected
Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders are more likely to have problems with anxiety."

When is it necessary to replace the aortic valve?,"The aortic valve may need to be replaced for 2 reasons:
the valve has become narrowed (aortic stenosis) – the opening of the valve becomes smaller, obstructing the flow of blood out of the heart
the valve is leaky (aortic regurgitation) – the valve allows blood to flow back through into the heart
The problems can get worse over time and in severe cases can lead to life-threatening problems such as heart failure if left untreated.
There are no medicines to treat aortic valve problems, so replacing the valve will be recommended if you're at risk of serious complications but are otherwise well enough to have surgery. 
Find out more about why aortic valve replacements are carried out"
How is an aortic valve replacement carried out?,"An aortic valve replacement is carried out under general anaesthetic.
This means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out.
During the procedure:
a large cut (incision) about 25cm long is made in your chest to access your heart – although sometimes a smaller cut may be made
your heart is stopped and a heart-lung (bypass) machine is used to take over the job of your heart during the operation
the damaged or faulty valve is removed and replaced with the new one
your heart is restarted and the opening in your chest is closed
The operation usually takes a few hours.
You'll have a discussion with your doctor or surgeon before the procedure to decide whether a synthetic or animal tissue replacement valve is most suitable for you.
Find out what happens during an aortic valve replacement"
Recovering from an aortic valve replacement,"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for about a week after an aortic valve replacement, although it may be 2 to 3 months before you fully recover.
You should take things easy when you first get home, but you can start to gradually return to your normal activities over the next few weeks.
You'll be given specific advice about any side effects you can expect while you recover and any activities you should avoid.
You won't usually be able to drive for around 6 weeks and you'll probably need 6 to 12 weeks off work, depending on your job.

Risks of an aortic valve replacement,"An aortic valve replacement is a big operation and, like any type of surgery, carries a risk of complications.
Some of the main risks of an aortic valve replacement include:
wound, lung, bladder or heart valve infections
blood clots
strokes
a temporarily irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
reduced kidney function for a few days
The risk of dying from an aortic valve replacement is around 2%, although this risk is much smaller than that of leaving severe aortic valve problems untreated.
Most people who survive surgery have a life expectancy close to normal.
Read more about the risks of aortic valve replacement."
Alternatives to an aortic valve replacement,"An aortic valve replacement is the most effective treatment for aortic valve conditions. 
Alternative procedures are usually only used if open heart surgery is too risky.
Possible alternatives include:
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) – the replacement valve is guided into place through the blood vessels, rather than through a large incision in the chest
aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty – the valve is widened using a balloon
sutureless aortic valve replacement – the valve is not secured using stitches (sutures) to minimise the time spent on a heart-lung machine
Read more about the alternatives to an aortic valve replacement."
Symptoms of aphasia,"People with aphasia often have trouble with the 4 main ways people understand and use language.
These are:
reading
listening
speaking
typing or writing
Speaking problems are perhaps the most obvious, and people with aphasia may make mistakes with the words they use.
This could be sometimes using the wrong sounds in a word, choosing the wrong word, or putting words together incorrectly.
Although aphasia affects a person's ability to communicate, it doesn't affect their intelligence.
Aphasia can occur by itself or alongside other disorders, such as visual difficulties, mobility problems, limb weakness, and problems with memory or thinking skills."
Types of aphasia,"Aphasia is often classified as ""expressive"" or ""receptive"", depending on whether there are difficulties with understanding or expressing language, or both.
But most people with aphasia have some trouble with their speaking, and will have a mixture of problems with writing, reading and perhaps listening.
Symptoms can range widely from getting a few words mixed up to having difficulty with all forms of communication.
Some people are unaware that their speech makes no sense and get frustrated when others don't understand them.
Read more about the different types of aphasia."
Causes of aphasia,"Aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and producing language.
Common causes include:
stroke – the most common cause of aphasia
severe head injury
a brain tumour
progressive neurological conditions – conditions that cause the brain and nervous system to become damaged over time, such as dementia
Aphasia can affect people of all ages, but it's most common in people over the age of 65. This is because strokes and progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults."
Diagnosing aphasia,"Aphasia is usually diagnosed after tests carried out by a clinician – either a speech and language therapist or a doctor. They can also help arrange treatment if necessary.
These tests often involve simple exercises, such as asking a person to name objects in the room, repeat words and sentences, and read and write.
The aim of these tests is to understand a person's ability to:
understand basic speech and grammar
express words, phrases and sentences
socially communicate – for example, hold a conversation or understand a joke
read and write letters, words and sentences
Imaging techniques such as a CT scan or MRI scan can be used to assess brain damage."
Treating aphasia,"Speech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia.
This aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate, as well as help you develop alternative ways of communicating, if necessary.
You may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis or in a group, depending on your needs and the service provided.
An increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia.
But it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist.
How successful treatment is differs from person to person. Most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery, and some recover fully.
If the aphasia is caused by a one-off event, like a stroke, most patients recover to some degree with therapy. There's no evidence to suggest that recovery stops at a specific time after stroke.
But the chance of recovery is poorer for people with aphasia resulting from a progressive neurological condition.
Some people can still respond to therapy, but there are currently no good ways of reversing the ongoing injury to the brain.
When aphasia is caused by a progressive condition, treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do and developing other ways of communicating to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult.
Read more about treating aphasia."
Complications of aphasia,"The challenges of living with aphasia can impact how a person feels and interacts with others.
In some cases, it can lead to:
isolation
anxiety
depression
If you're concerned about someone with aphasia, encourage them to discuss any problems with their GP or a member of their care team to access the relevant support.
If the person is unable to do this themselves, they may require someone to communicate on their behalf."
Symptoms of appendicitis,"Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.
Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe.
Pressing on this area, coughing or walking may make the pain worse.
You may lose your appetite, feel sick and have constipation or diarrhoea."
When to get medical help,"If you have abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact a GP or your local out-of-hours service immediately.
If these options are not available, call NHS 111 for advice.
Call 999 to ask for an ambulance if you have pain that suddenly gets worse and spreads across your abdomen, or if your pain temporarily improves before getting worse again.
If your pain eases for a while but then gets worse, your appendix may have burst, which can lead to life-threatening complications.
Read more about diagnosing appendicitis and complications of appendicitis."
How appendicitis is treated,"If you have appendicitis, it's likely your appendix will need to be removed as soon as possible.
Removal of the appendix, known as an appendicectomy or appendectomy, is 1 of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent.
It's most commonly carried out as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy).
Several small cuts are made in the abdomen, allowing special surgical instruments to be inserted.
Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually used if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.
It usually takes a couple of weeks to make a full recovery after your appendix has been removed.
But strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6 weeks after having open surgery."
What causes appendicitis?,"It's not clear what causes appendicitis. In many cases it may be that something blocks the entrance of the appendix.
For example, it could become blocked by a small piece of poo, or an upper respiratory tract infection could cause the lymph node within the wall of the bowel to become swollen.
If the obstruction causes inflammation and swelling, it could lead to increased pressure within the appendix, which may then burst.
As the causes of appendicitis are not fully understood, there's no guaranteed way of preventing it."
Who's affected,"Appendicitis is a common condition. In England, around 50,000 people are admitted to hospital with appendicitis each year.
You can get appendicitis at any age, but it usually affects people aged between 10 and 30 years."
Preventing arrhythmias,"It is not always possible to prevent an arrhythmia developing, although a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of developing a heart condition.
Treatment aims to prevent future episodes. You can also make lifestyle changes so you avoid some of the triggers for your heart rhythm problem."
Your heart's electrical system,"The heart's rhythm is controlled by electrical signals. An arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart's rhythm. It may beat too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly.
These abnormalities range from a minor inconvenience or discomfort to a potentially fatal problem."
Symptoms of arrhythmias,"Symptoms of arrhythmias include palpitations, feeling dizzy, fainting and being short of breath, although having these symptoms does not always mean you have a heart rhythm problem.
Arrhythmia Alliance's heart rhythm checklists can help you gather information to discuss with your GP if you have any of these symptoms."
Diagnosing arrhythmias,"If your symptoms persist or there's a history of unexplained sudden death in your family, it's important for your GP to refer you to a heart specialist (a cardiologist or electrophysiologist who specialises in heart rhythm disorders).
The most effective way to diagnose an arrhythmia is with an electrical recording of your heart rhythm called an electrocardiogram (ECG). If the ECG doesn't find a problem, you may need further monitoring of your heart.
This may involve wearing a small portable ECG recording device for 24 hours or longer. This is called a Holter monitor or ambulatory ECG monitoring. Some people might be asked to wear an ECG monitor for up to 14 days.
If your symptoms seem to be triggered by exercise, an exercise ECG may be needed to record your heart rhythm while you are using a treadmill or exercise bike.
You should request a copy of your ECG. Take it with you to see the cardiologist or heart rhythm specialist and always keep a copy for future use.
Other tests used in diagnosing arrhythmias include:
cardiac event recorder – a device to record occasional symptoms over a period of time whenever you have them
electrophysiological (EP) study – a test to locate problems with the electrical signals in your heart by passing soft wires up a vein in your leg and into your heart while you are sedated
echocardiogram (echo) – an ultrasound scan of your heart"
Treatment for arrhythmias,"How your arrhythmia will be treated will depend on whether it is a fast or slow arrhythmia or heart block. Any underlying causes of your arrhythmia, such as heart failure, will need to be treated as well.
The treatments used for arrhythmias include:
medicine – to stop or prevent an arrhythmia or control the rate of an arrhythmia
electrical cardioversion – a treatment that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm while you are anaesthetised or sedated
catheter ablation – a keyhole treatment under local or general anaesthetic that carefully destroys the diseased tissue in your heart that causes the arrhythmia
pacemaker – a small device containing its own battery that is implanted in your chest under local anaesthetic; it produces electrical signals to do the work of the natural pacemaker in your heart to help it beat at a normal rate
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) – a device similar to a pacemaker that monitors your heart rhythm and shocks your heart back into a normal rhythm whenever this is needed"
Staying safe with an arrhythmia,"If you have an arrhythmia that affects your driving, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
If your job involves working at height or with machinery that could be dangerous, you will need to stop work at least until your arrhythmia is diagnosed or you get treatment for your underlying condition. Get advice from your GP or cardiologist."

Types of arthritis,"Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis.
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK.
It most often develops in people in their mid-40s or older.
It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. 
But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.
Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder.
This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes.
Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.
The most commonly affected joints are those in the:
hands
spine
knees
hips
Find out more about osteoarthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis.
It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men.
In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. 
The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected.
This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.
People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.
Find out more about rheumatoid arthritis
Other types of arthritis and related conditions
ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints
cervical spondylosis – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness
fibromyalgia – causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons
lupus – an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues
gout – a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe), but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling
psoriatic arthritis – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis
enteropathic arthritis – a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 2 main types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the lower limb joints and the spine
reactive arthritis – this can cause pain and swelling of the joints, sore eyes and extreme tiredness. It develops shortly after an infection of the gut, bowel or throat
secondary arthritis – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards
polymyalgia rheumatica – a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation"
Symptoms of arthritis,"There are lots of different types of arthritis.
The symptoms you experience will vary depending on the type you have.
This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:
joint pain, tenderness and stiffness
inflammation in and around the joints
restricted movement of the joints
warm red skin over the affected joint
weakness and muscle wasting"
Arthritis and children,"Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children.
Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
JIA causes pain and inflammation in 1 or more joints for at least 6 weeks.
Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.
Oligo-articular JIA (oligoarthritis)
Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects up to 4 joints in the body, most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.
Oligo-articular JIA often goes away without causing long-term joint damage.
But there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an eyecare specialist called an ophthalmologist are recommended.
Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)
Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, is the second most common type of JIA and affects 5 or more joints.
It can affect a child of any age and may come on suddenly or develop gradually.
The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis.
A child with the condition may also feel unwell and may occasionally have a high temperature of 38C or above.
Systemic onset JIA
Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, a lack of energy and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed.
Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.
Enthesitis-related arthritis
Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that often affects the joints of the leg and spine, causing inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone.
It can cause stiffness in the neck and lower back in the teenage years.
It's also linked to a painful eye condition called acute uveitis.

Treating arthritis,"There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow it down.
Osteoarthritis treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery.
Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation. This helps prevent joint damage.
Treatments include medicine, physiotherapy and surgery.

Symptoms of asbestosis,"Symptoms of asbestosis include:
shortness of breath
persistent cough
wheezing
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
pain in your chest or shoulder
in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips
It can take 20 to 30 years after being exposed to asbestos before symptoms appear.
There are sometimes no symptoms."
Causes of asbestosis,"Asbestosis is caused by exposure to asbestos.
You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, particularly from the 1950s to the 1990s.
You could be exposed to asbestos today if your job involves working in certain roles in old buildings.
Examples include:
heating and ventilation engineers
demolition workers
plumbers
construction workers
electricians"
Tests for asbestosis,"A GP will listen to your lungs and ask about your work history.
They may refer you to a specialist in lung diseases for more tests if they think you might have asbestosis.
Tests may include:
a chest X-ray
a CT scan of the lungs
lung function tests to see how well your lungs are working"
Treatment for asbestosis,"There's no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, as it's not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.
But some treatments can help, including:
pulmonary rehabilitation – a programme of exercises and education to help manage your symptoms
oxygen therapy – breathing in oxygen-rich air from a machine or tank to help improve breathlessness if your blood oxygen levels are low
using an inhaler to ease breathing (if your symptoms are mild)"
Things you can do to help with asbestosis,"If you have asbestosis, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and lower your chances of getting infections.
Do
try to quit smoking if you smoke – your symptoms may get worse if you smoke, and it increases the risk of lung cancer
get the flu vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccination – this reduces your chance of getting an infection that affects your lungs"
How you get aspergillosis,"Aspergillosis is usually caused by inhaling tiny bits of mould. The mould is found in lots of places, including:
soil, compost and rotting leaves
plants, trees and crops
dust
damp buildings
air conditioning systems
You cannot catch aspergillosis from someone else or from animals.
Information:
Most people who breathe in the mould do not get ill."
Aspergillosis is rare in healthy people,"You're usually only at risk of aspergillosis if you have:
a lung condition – such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
a weakened immune system – for example, if you have had an organ transplant or are having chemotherapy
had tuberculosis (TB) in the past
severe flu or coronavirus (COVID-19) and need artificial ventilation"
Symptoms of aspergillosis,"Symptoms of aspergillosis include:
shortness of breath
a cough – you may cough up blood or lumps of mucus
wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)
a high temperature of 38C or above
weight loss
If you already have a lung condition, your existing symptoms may get worse."
Treatment for aspergillosis depends on the type,"Treatment usually helps control the symptoms. If it's not treated or well controlled, there's a risk it could damage your lungs.
Treatments for common types of aspergillosis
Common types Treatment
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) – an allergy to aspergillus mould steroid tablets and antifungal tablets for a few months (possibly longer)
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) – a long-term lung infection long-term (possibly lifelong) treatment with antifungal tablets
Aspergilloma – a ball of mould in the lungs, often linked to CPA surgery to remove the ball if it's causing symptoms, often after antifungal treatment
Invasive pulmonary aspergillus (IPA) – a life-threatening infection in people with a weakened immune system antifungal medicine given directly into a vein in hospital"
You cannot always prevent aspergillosis,"It's almost impossible to completely avoid aspergillus mould.
But there are things you can do to reduce your risk of aspergillosis if you have a lung condition or weakened immune system.
Do
try to avoid places where aspergillus mould is often found, such as compost heaps and piles of dead leaves
close your windows if there's construction work or digging outside
wear a face mask in dusty places
consider using an air purifier at home – devices with HEPA filters are best
Don’t
do not dry your laundry in your bedroom or living areas, if possible – ideally dry it outside or in a tumble dryer
Information:
You can find out more about aspergillosis on the Aspergillosis Patients and Carers website."
Symptoms of asthma,"The main symptoms of asthma are:
a whistling sound when breathing (wheezing)
breathlessness
a tight chest, which may feel like a band is tightening around it
coughing
The symptoms can sometimes get temporarily worse. This is known as an asthma attack."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you think you or your child may have asthma.
Several conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis and correct treatment.
The GP will usually be able to diagnose asthma by asking about symptoms and carrying out some simple tests.
Find out more about how asthma is diagnosed."
Treatments for asthma,"Asthma is usually treated by using an inhaler, a small device that lets you breathe in medicines.
The main types are:
reliever inhalers – used when needed to quickly relieve asthma symptoms for a short time
preventer inhalers – used every day to prevent asthma symptoms happening
Some people also need to take tablets."
Causes and triggers of asthma,"Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This makes the tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily narrow.
It may happen randomly or after exposure to a trigger.
Common asthma triggers include:
allergies (to house dust mites, animals or pollen, for example)
smoke, pollution and cold air
exercise
infections like colds or flu
Identifying and avoiding your asthma triggers can help you keep your symptoms under control."
How long asthma lasts for,"Asthma is a long-term condition for many people, particularly if it first develops when you're an adult.
In children, it sometimes goes away or improves during the teenage years, but can come back later in life.
The symptoms can usually be controlled with treatment. Most people will have normal, active lives, although some people with more severe asthma may have ongoing problems."
Complications of asthma,"Although asthma can normally be kept under control, it's still a serious condition that can cause a number of problems.
This is why it's important to follow your treatment plan and not ignore your symptoms if they're getting worse.
Badly controlled asthma can cause problems such as:
feeling tired all the time
underperformance at, or absence from, work or school
stress, anxiety or depression
disruption of your work and leisure because of unplanned visits to a GP or hospital
lung infections (pneumonia)
delays in growth or puberty in children
There's also a risk of severe asthma attacks, which can be life threatening."
What is astigmatism?,"Astigmatism means your eye is shaped more like a rugby ball than a football, so light is focused at more than 1 place in the eye.
This can cause:
blurred vision
headaches
eye strain (you may notice this after concentrating for a long time – on a computer, for example)
Astigmatism normally happens alongside short-sightedness or long-sightedness.
Astigmatism in 1 eye may cause lazy eye (where the vision does not develop properly). It's important this is spotted early so it can be treated.
Important:
Regular eye tests for children
Take your child for regular eye tests. Astigmatism, as well as short-sightedness or long-sightedness, may affect their reading or concentration.
Find an optician
Teenagers with astigmatism should also have regular eye tests to check for an eye condition called keratoconus. This causes the cornea to change shape."
Treatments for astigmatism,"If astigmatism is affecting your eyesight, there are ways to correct it.

Types of ataxia,"There are many different types of ataxia, which can be divided into three broad categories:
acquired ataxia – where symptoms develop as the result of trauma, a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), a brain tumour, nutritional deficiencies, or other problems that damage the brain or nervous system
hereditary ataxia – where symptoms develop slowly over many years and are caused by faulty genes that a person inherits from their parents; the most common type is Friedreich's ataxia
idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) – where the brain is progressively damaged over time for reasons that are unclear
Read more about the main types of ataxia."
What causes ataxia?,"Ataxia usually results from damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to other parts of the nervous system.
This damage can be part of an underlying condition such as MS, or can be caused by a head injury, lack of oxygen to the brain, or long-term, excessive alcohol consumption.
Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene passed on by family members, who may or may not be affected.
Read more about the causes of ataxia."
How ataxia is treated,"In most cases, there's no cure for ataxia and supportive treatment to control the symptoms is necessary.
This may include:
speech and language therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems
physiotherapy to help with movement problems
occupational therapy to help you cope with the day-to-day problems
medication to control muscle, bladder, heart and eye problems
In a few cases, it's possible to improve ataxia or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause.
Read more about treating ataxia."
Outlook,"The outlook for ataxia can vary considerably and largely depends on the type of ataxia you have. Some types may remain relatively stable or even improve with time, but most will get progressively worse over many years.
Life expectancy is generally shorter than normal for people with hereditary ataxia, although some people can live well into their 50s, 60s or beyond. In more severe cases, the condition can be fatal in childhood or early adulthood.
For acquired ataxia, the outlook depends on the underlying cause. Some cases may improve or stay the same, while other cases may get gradually worse over time and reduce life expectancy."
Check if you have atherosclerosis,"You may not have any symptoms of atherosclerosis, but symptoms can include:
chest pain
pain in your arms and legs, especially when exercising
feeling short of breath
feeling tired all the time
feeling weak
feeling confused"
Causes of atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis happens when fatty deposits build up in the arteries, which causes them to narrow.
Things that increase your chances of getting atherosclerosis include:
being over 65 years of age
smoking
having high cholesterol
having high blood pressure
having close relatives who have cardiovascular disease"
Things you can do to help with atherosclerosis,"There are some things you can do to help stop atherosclerosis getting worse:
Do
eat healthily and eat less saturated fat and sugar
exercise regularly
maintain a healthy weight
keep your blood sugar levels under control if you have diabetes
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink more than 14 units of alcohol per week"
Treatments for atherosclerosis,"There are currently no treatments to reverse atherosclerosis, but you may be offered medicines to lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke.
You may need medicines to:
lower your cholesterol (statins)
lower your blood pressure
lower your risk of blood clots
lower your blood sugar levels if you have diabetes
You may also need surgery to help improve blood flow through the affected arteries."
Complications of atherosclerosis,"Without lifestyle changes and medical treatment, atherosclerosis may get worse over time.
It can cause:
heart attacks
stroke
peripheral arterial disease
other types of cardiovascular disease"
Symptoms of athlete's foot,"One of the main symptoms of Athlete's foot is itchy white patches between your toes.

Other symptoms
Athlete's foot can also affect your soles or sides of your feet. It sometimes causes fluid-filled blisters.
If it's not treated, the infection can spread to your toenails and cause a fungal nail infection."
A pharmacist can help with athlete's foot,"Athlete's foot is unlikely to get better on its own, but you can buy antifungal medicines for it from a pharmacy. They usually take a few weeks to work.
Athlete's foot treatments are available as:
creams
sprays
powders
They're not all suitable for everyone – for example, some are only for adults. Always check the packet or ask a pharmacist.
You might need to try a few treatments to find one that works best for you.
Find a pharmacy
Things you can do if you have athlete's foot
You can keep using some pharmacy treatments to stop athlete's foot coming back.
It's also important to keep your feet clean and dry. You do not need to stay off work or school.
Do
dry your feet after washing them, particularly between your toes – dab them dry rather than rubbing them
use a separate towel for your feet and wash it regularly
take your shoes off when at home
wear clean socks every day – cotton socks are best
Don’t
do not scratch affected skin – this can spread it to other parts of your body
do not walk around barefoot – wear flip-flops in places like changing rooms and showers
do not share towels, socks or shoes with other people
do not wear the same pair of shoes for more than 2 days in a row
do not wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty
Important
Keep following this advice after finishing treatment to help stop athlete's foot coming back."
Treatment for athlete's foot from a GP,"The GP may:
send a small scraping of skin from your feet to a laboratory to check you have athlete's foot
prescribe a steroid cream to use alongside antifungal cream
prescribe antifungal tablets – you might need to take these for several weeks
refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) for more tests and treatment if needed"
How you get athlete's foot,"You can catch athlete's foot from other people with the infection.
You can get it by:
walking barefoot in places where someone else has athlete's foot – especially changing rooms and showers
touching the affected skin of someone with athlete's foot
You're more likely to get it if you have wet or sweaty feet, or if the skin on your feet is damaged."
Symptoms of atopic eczema,"Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can look red on white skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on brown and black skin. This means it may also be more difficult to see on brown and black skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands in adults, and the inside of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. It may also affect the outside of elbows and front of knees in children with brown and black skin.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups)."
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, you or your child will be diagnosed with atopic eczema if you, or they, have an itchy skin condition and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under, and children with brown and black skin) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months (in children)
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
if your child is 4 years old or older and the condition started before the age of 2"
Causes of atopic eczema,"The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. 
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms."
Treating atopic eczema,"Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms, and the condition often improves over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections. 
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups"
Other types of eczema,"Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands and bottom (soles) of the feet"
Symptoms of atrial fibrillation,"In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate is irregular and can sometimes be very fast. In some cases, it can be considerably higher than 100 beats a minute.
This can cause problems including dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness.
You may be aware of noticeable heart palpitations, where your heart feels like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for a few seconds or, in some cases, a few minutes.
Sometimes atrial fibrillation does not cause any symptoms and a person who has it is completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular."
When to see a GP,"See a GP or call 111 if:
you have chest pain that comes and goes
you have chest pain that goes away quickly but you're still worried
you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat
your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100 (particularly if you're experiencing other symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as dizziness and shortness of breath)
It's important to get medical advice to make sure it's nothing serious."
What causes atrial fibrillation?,"When the heart beats normally, its muscular walls tighten and squeeze (contract) to force blood out and around the body.
They then relax so the heart can fill with blood again. This process is repeated every time the heart beats.
In atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) contract randomly and sometimes so fast that the heart muscle cannot relax properly between contractions. This reduces the heart's efficiency and performance.
Atrial fibrillation happens when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria.
These impulses override the heart's natural pacemaker, which can no longer control the rhythm of the heart. This causes you to have a highly irregular pulse rate.
The cause is not fully understood, but it tends to affect certain groups of people, such as older people and people living with long-term (chronic) conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure or obesity.
It may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking too much alcohol or smoking.
Atrial fibrillation can be defined in various ways, depending on the degree to which it affects you.
For example:
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation – episodes come and go, and usually stop within 48 hours without any treatment
persistent atrial fibrillation – each episode lasts for longer than 7 days (or less when it's treated)
permanent atrial fibrillation – when it's present all the time
long-standing atrial fibrillation – where you've had atrial fibrillation usually for over a year"
Who's affected,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, affecting around 1.4 million people in the UK.
It can affect adults of any age, but it's more common in older people.
More men than women have atrial fibrillation. 
Atrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), atherosclerosis or a heart valve problem.

Social care and support guide
If you:
need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability
care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled (including family members)
Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support."
Treating atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation is not usually life threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and often requires treatment.
Treatment may involve: 
medicines to prevent a stroke (people with atrial fibrillation are more at risk of having a stroke)
medicines to control the heart rate or rhythm
cardioversion – where the heart is given a controlled electric shock to restore normal rhythm
catheter ablation – where the area inside the heart that's causing the abnormal heart rhythm is destroyed using radiofrequency energy; afterwards you may then need to have a pacemaker fitted to help your heart beat regularly"
Atrial flutter,"Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation, but shares the same symptoms, causes and possible complications.
Some people with atrial flutter also have atrial fibrillation.
Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in the atria is more organised and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns caused by atrial fibrillation.
Treatment for atrial flutter is also slightly different. Catheter ablation is considered to be the best treatment for atrial flutter, whereas medicine is often the first treatment used for atrial fibrillation."
Getting help,"Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This does not necessarily mean they have ADHD.
But you should discuss your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or a GP if you think their behaviour may be different from most children their age.
It's also a good idea to speak to a GP if you're an adult and think you may have ADHD, but were not diagnosed with the condition as a child."
What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?,"The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families.
Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD when compared with those without the condition.
Other factors suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include:
being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)
having a low birthweight
smoking or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy
ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties."
How attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated,"For children with ADHD, although there's no cure, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medicine, if necessary.
For adults with ADHD, medicine is often the first treatment offered, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help."
Living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Parents of children with ADHD
Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they cannot help their behaviour.
Some day-to-day activities might be more difficult for you and your child, including:
getting your child to sleep at night
getting ready for school on time
listening to and carrying out instructions
being organised
social occasions
shopping
Adults with ADHD
Adults with ADHD may find they have problems with:
organisation and time management
following instructions
focusing and completing tasks
coping with stress
feeling restless or impatient
impulsiveness and risk taking
Some adults may also have issues with relationships or social interaction."
Check if you or your child have auditory processing disorder (APD),"Auditory processing disorder (APD) often starts in childhood, but some people develop it later.
If you or your child have APD, you may find it difficult to understand:
people speaking in noisy places
people with strong accents or fast talkers
similar sounding words
spoken instructions
APD is not a hearing problem. People with the condition usually have normal hearing."
Tests for auditory processing disorder (APD),"To test for auditory processing disorder (APD) you or your child may be asked to:
listen to speech with background noise
spot small changes in sounds
fill in missing parts of words
Other tests may include:
having electrodes on your head to measure how your brain reacts to sound
speech and language tests
memory, problem-solving and concentration tests
Testing for APD is not usually done on children under 7 years old."
Treating auditory processing disorder (APD),"There's no cure for auditory processing disorder (APD) but there are things that can help.
Treatment usually involves activities to improve listening and concentration. This is called auditory training. You can do it with a hearing specialist or in your own time online.
To reduce background noise, schoolchildren with APD may be advised to wear a wireless earpiece that connects to a tiny microphone worn by their teacher."
Things you can do to help with auditory processing disorder (APD),"There are things that you and other people can do to help with your or your child's auditory processing disorder (APD).
Do
talk face to face
use pictures and text
repeat or rephrase things if necessary
use carpet and soft furnishings to reduce room noise
Don’t
do not cover your mouth when talking
do not talk in long complicated sentences
do not speak too fast or too slow
do not have background noise, like TV and radio"
Causes of auditory processing disorder (APD),"It's not always clear what causes auditory processing disorder (APD).
Possible causes include:
regular ear infections
genetics
head injury
complications at birth
APD is often found in people with attention, language and learning difficulties, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."
What causes ADPKD,"ADPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of some of the cells in the kidneys and causes cysts to grow.
Faults in 1 of 2 different genes are known to cause ADPKD.
The affected genes are:
PKD1, which accounts for around 78% of cases
PKD2, which accounts for around 15% of cases
Both types of ADPKD have the same symptoms, but they tend to be more severe in PKD1.
A child has a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene.
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease that can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene. In this type problems usually start much earlier, during childhood.
Non-inherited ADPKD
In up to 1 in 4 (25%) cases, a person develops ADPKD without having a known family history of the condition.
This could be because the condition was never diagnosed in a relative, or a relative with the condition may have died before their symptoms were recognised.
In around 1 in 10 cases of ADPKD, the mutation develops for the first time in the affected person. It's not known what causes this to happen.
The affected person can pass the faulty gene on to their children in the same way as someone who's inherited it from a parent."
Who's affected,"ADPKD is the most common inherited condition to affect the kidneys, although it's still relatively uncommon.
It's estimated up to 1 in every 1000 to 2500 people in the UK has ADPKD. This means there could be between 30,000 and 70,000 people in the UK with the condition."
Treating ADPKD,"There's currently no cure for ADPKD, however:
a healthy lifestyle may help to protect your kidney function
various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition
Most problems, such as high blood pressure, pain and UTIs, can be treated with medication, although you may need to have an operation to remove any large kidney stones that develop.
If the condition reaches a point where the kidneys are not able to function properly, there are 2 main treatment options:
dialysis, where a machine is used to replicate kidney functions
a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure
A medication called tolvaptan can be used to slow down the formation of cysts and protect kidney function.
Find out more about treating ADPKD"
Outlook,"The outlook for ADPKD is highly variable. Some people experience kidney failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, whereas others may live the rest of their life with their kidneys working relatively well.
On average, around half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the time they're 60.
As well as kidney failure, ADPKD can also cause a number of other potentially serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes caused by high blood pressure, or bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) caused by a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm).
Find out more about the complications of ADPKD"
Information about you,"If you have ADPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

The kidneys,"The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the back of the body, just underneath the ribcage.
The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and pass them out of the body in urine.
The kidneys also play an important role in:
helping to maintain blood pressure at a healthy level
keeping salt and water in balance
making hormones needed for the production of blood and bone"
The kidneys,"The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just beneath the rib cage.
The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine.
The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level."
What causes ARPKD?,"ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver.
In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them.
Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function.
Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow a digestive fluid called bile to flow out of the liver.
The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time.
ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents.
If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have developing ARPKD.
The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood.
Sometimes ADPKD can happen when only one parent has passed on a faulty gene, but this is rare.
Find out more about the causes of ARPKD"
Treating ARPKD,"There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause.
Treatment for ARPKD may include:
breathing assistance with a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs (a ventilator) for children with severe breathing difficulties
medication to treat high blood pressure
procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur
medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia
If kidney failure does occur, there are 2 main treatment options:
dialysis, where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney
a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure
Find out more about how ARPKD is treated"
Outlook,"The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably depending on the severity of the condition.
If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage.
But in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first 4 weeks after birth.
About 9 out of 10 babies with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least 5 years old.
It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates.
But with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood."
Information about you,"If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Bird flu in the UK,"Plans are in place to manage any suspected cases of bird flu in the UK.
H5N8 and H5N1 bird flu have been found in some poultry, other captive birds and wild birds in the UK.
H5N6 has also been found in some wild birds in the UK, but this is a different strain to the H5N6 virus that has infected some people in China.
You can read the latest bird flu updates on GOV.UK."
How bird flu spreads to humans,"Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive).
This includes:
touching infected birds
touching droppings or bedding
killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking
Markets where live birds are sold can also be a source of bird flu. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling to countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. You can check health advice for the country you're visiting on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can't catch bird flu through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of bird flu."
Things you can do to prevent bird flu,"If you're visiting a foreign country that's had an outbreak you should:
wash your hands often with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling food, in particular raw poultry
use different utensils for cooked and raw meat
make sure meat is cooked until steaming hot
avoid contact with live birds and poultry
What not to do:
do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick or dead birds
do not go to live animal markets or poultry farms
do not bring any live birds or poultry back to the UK, including feathers
do not eat undercooked or raw poultry or duck
do not eat raw eggs
There is no bird flu vaccine
The seasonal flu vaccine doesn't protect against bird flu."
Symptoms of bird flu in humans,"The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include:
a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery
aching muscles
headache
a cough or shortness of breath
Other early symptoms may include:
diarrhoea
sickness
stomach pain
chest pain
bleeding from the nose and gums
conjunctivitis
It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you've been infected.
Within days of symptoms appearing, it's possible to develop more severe complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Getting treatment quickly, using antiviral medicine, may prevent complications and reduce the risk of developing severe illness."
When to seek medical advice,"Use NHS 111 online (111.nhs.uk) or call NHS 111 if you experience any symptoms of bird flu and have visited an area affected by bird flu in the past 10 days.
Your symptoms can be checked over the phone.
If you're abroad
Get medical help straight away if you get the symptoms of bird flu.
Contact your travel insurance company if you need advice about where to get help."
What a doctor can do,"Tell the doctor if you have:
recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within 1 metre) to live or dead birds
had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness
had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and was from an area that had an outbreak
These tests can be done to confirm bird flu:
a nose and throat swab to see if they contain the virus
if you're coughing up phlegm this may be tested for the virus
If the tests are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu."
Treatment for bird flu,"If it's thought you might have symptoms of bird flu you'll be advised to stay at home, or you'll be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients.
You may be given an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).
Antiviral medicines help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.
They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff."
Reporting suspected cases of bird flu in birds,"If you suspect bird flu in poultry or other captive birds, you must report it immediately by calling:
03000 200 301 if you're in England
03003 038 268 if you're in Wales
APHA Field Services if you're in Scotland
Bird flu is a notifiable disease in poultry and other captive birds. If you do not report it, you’re breaking the law.
Read more about notifiable diseases in animals from GOV.UK.
Signs that a bird may be infected with bird flu include:
sudden death
swollen head
closed and runny eyes
Reporting dead wild birds can also help the authorities keep track of the spread of the disease.
For a complete list of bird flu symptoms in birds, and further advice, visit Bird flu (avian influenza): how to spot it and report it on GOV.UK."
Causes of back pain,"Back pain can have many causes. It's not always obvious what causes it, and it often gets better on its own.
A common cause of back pain is an injury like a pulled muscle (strain).
Sometimes, medical conditions like a slipped disc, sciatica (a trapped nerve) or ankylosing spondylitis can cause back pain.
Very rarely, back pain can be a sign of a serious problem such as a broken bone, cancer or an infection."
How to ease back pain yourself,"Back pain often improves on its own within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help speed up your recovery.
Do
stay active and try to continue with your daily activities
take anti-inflammatory medicine like ibuprofen – paracetamol on its own is not recommended for back pain but it may be used with another painkiller
use an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to reduce pain and swelling
use a heat pack (or hot water bottle) wrapped in a tea towel to relieve joint stiffness or muscle spasms
try doing some exercises and stretches for back pain
Don’t
do not stay in bed for long periods of time"
Treatments for back pain,"If your back pain is severe or not getting better, a GP may prescribe painkillers or medicines to relax the muscles in your back.
Other treatments may be recommended if your pain does not get better after a few weeks.
These include:
group exercise sessions and physiotherapy
manual therapy – where a trained therapist massages and moves the muscles, bones and joints in your back
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to help you cope with the pain
a procedure to seal off some of the nerves in your back so they stop sending pain signals (only for long-term lower back pain)
If your back pain is caused by a medical condition like a slipped disc and other treatments have not helped, surgery may be an option.
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have back pain, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for back pain near you"
Check if you have bacterial vaginosis,"Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include:
an unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell, particularly after sex
a change to the colour and consistency of your discharge, such as becoming greyish-white and thin and watery
Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms.
Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, a GP or sexual health clinic will want to confirm it is bacterial vaginosis and rule out an STI.
You'll be asked about your symptoms, and a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina.
A cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge inside your vagina to test for bacterial vaginosis and other infections."
Treatment for bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.
These are prescribed by a GP or sexual health clinic.
If you have a same-sex partner, they may also need treatment.
Recurring bacterial vaginosis
It's common for bacterial vaginosis to come back, usually within a few months. If it comes back, you'll usually be given more antibiotics to treat it.
If you keep getting it (you get it more than 4 times in a year), you may be given an antibiotic gel that you put in your vagina. You may need to use this for a few months to help stop bacterial vaginosis coming back.
A GP or sexual health clinic will recommend how long you need to treat it.
They can also help identify if something is triggering your bacterial vaginosis, such as sex or your period."
Things you can do yourself,"There are things you can do to help relieve symptoms and prevent bacterial vaginosis returning.
Do
use water and plain soap to wash your genital area
have showers instead of baths
Don’t
do not use perfumed soaps, bubble bath, shampoo or shower gel in the bath
do not use vaginal deodorants, washes or douches
do not put antiseptic liquids in the bath
do not use strong detergents to wash your underwear
do not smoke"
What causes bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina.
What causes this to happen is not fully known, but you're more likely to get it if:
you're sexually active (but women who have not had sex can also get bacterial vaginosis)
you have had a change of partner
you have an IUD (contraception device)
you use perfumed products in or around your vagina
Bacterial vaginosis is not an STI, even though it can be triggered by sex.
A woman can pass it to another woman during sex.
You're more likely to get an STI if you have bacterial vaginosis. This may be because it makes your vagina less acidic and reduces your natural defences against infection."
Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy,"If you develop bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, there's a small chance of complications, such as premature birth or miscarriage.
But bacterial vaginosis causes no problems in the majority of pregnancies.
Speak to a GP or your midwife if you're pregnant and your vaginal discharge changes."
How to treat bad breath yourself,"The best way of making sure you do not have bad breath is to keep your teeth, tongue and mouth clean.
Do
gently brush your teeth and gums at least twice a day for 2 minutes
use a fluoride toothpaste
gently clean your tongue once a day using a tongue scraper or cleaner
clean between your teeth with interdental brushes or floss at least once a day
get regular dental check-ups
keep dentures clean and remove them at night
use sugar-free mints or chewing gum after having strong-smelling food and drinks
try using an antibacterial mouthwash or toothpaste
Don’t
do not smoke
do not rinse your mouth with water straight after brushing your teeth
do not have lots of sugary foods and drinks
do not brush so hard your gums or tongue bleed"
Causes of bad breath,"Causes of bad breath include:
eating or drinking strong-smelling or spicy foods and drinks
problems with your teeth or gums, such as gum disease, holes in your teeth or an infection
crash dieting
some medical conditions, like dry mouth, tonsillitis and acid reflux
smoking"
What causes a Baker's cyst?,"Knee damage caused by a sports injury or a blow to the knee can lead to a Baker's cyst developing.
A Baker's cyst can also sometimes occur if you have a health condition such as:
osteoarthritis – usually caused by age-related ""wear and tear"" of joints; it particularly affects the knees, hips, hands and big toe
inflammatory arthritis – including rheumatoid arthritis, which is a less common type of arthritis and is caused by the immune system attacking the joints
gout – a type of arthritis that usually affects the big toe and is caused by a build-up of the waste product uric acid in the blood
Baker's cysts usually develop in people aged 30 to 70, although they can affect people of any age, including children."
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you have a lump behind your knee that's causing problems and does not clear up on its own. They'll usually be able to diagnose a Baker's cyst by examining the back of your knee and asking about your symptoms.
Your GP will ask you whether you have any associated health conditions, such as arthritis.
Tests may be recommended to rule out other more serious conditions, such as a tumour, an aneurysm (bulge in a section of a blood vessel) or DVT (deep vein thrombosis) (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body). You may need an ultrasound scan or a MRI scan."
Treating a Baker's cyst,"Treatment will not usually be necessary if you have a Baker's cyst that is not causing any symptoms.
Painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used to reduce the swelling and relieve any pain. A knee support or an ice pack may also help. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well as an ice pack.
If you have an underlying condition that's causing your cyst, it's important that the condition is properly managed. The cyst may disappear when the condition causing it has been treated.
In some cases, it may be possible to drain the cyst. Surgery may also be needed to repair any significant damage around the knee joint.
Read more about treating a Baker's cyst."
Check if you have balanitis,"With balanitis, the head of your penis is usually swollen, itchy and sore. It usually looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin.
Other symptoms can include:
pain when peeing
a thick discharge that comes from under your foreskin
bleeding around your foreskin
an unpleasant smell
difficulty pulling back your foreskin – though in young children it's normal to have a tight foreskin"
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of balanitis, a doctor or nurse will look at your penis and ask you a few questions.
If your symptoms are severe, they may suggest a blood test to check for conditions that can lead to balanitis, such as diabetes.
They may also wipe a cotton bud over the head of your penis to test for infections."
Treatment for balanitis,"Treatment for balanitis depends on what's causing it.
A GP may prescribe:
a mild steroid cream or ointment
an antifungal cream or ointment
antibiotics
If you or your child keeps getting balanitis and medicine has not helped, circumcision (surgery to remove the foreskin) may be considered."
Things you can do to help with balanitis,"If you have balanitis
Do
wash your penis every day using just water or an emollient (moisturising treatment)
gently pull back your foreskin and wash the area with warm water
dry gently after washing
if you use condoms, choose condoms for sensitive skin
wash your hands before peeing or touching your penis
Don’t
do not use soap or shower gel
If your child has balanitis
Do
gently wash your child's penis every day
use warm water and then dry it gently
if they wear nappies, change your child's nappies often
Don’t
do not use soap, bubble bath or baby wipes
do not pull your child's foreskin back if it's fixed in place"
Causes of balanitis,"Causes of balanitis include:
not washing your penis properly
some young boys have a very tight foreskin (phimosis), which means they cannot pull it back to clean under it
thrush
a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia – if a STI is suspected you may be referred to a sexual health clinic
substances such as soap, shower gels or condoms may irritate the skin
diabetes – high levels of sugar in your pee can cause thrush"
When barium enemas are used,"Nowadays, barium enemas aren't carried out very often, as alternative tests such as a colonoscopy or CT scan are usually preferred.
But a barium enema can sometimes be a useful way of finding the cause of problems like blood in your stools or a constant change in your bowel habits.
Conditions that can be detected during a barium enema include:
bowel cancer
growths in the bowel (bowel polyps)
inflammation of the bowel (ulcerative colitis) or Crohn's disease
pouches in the bowel (diverticular disease)"
Preparing for a barium enema,"To ensure the X-ray images taken during a barium enema are clear, your bowel must be empty before the test.
The hospital should send you instructions on what you need to do to prepare.
You'll normally be asked to:
eat a light diet – for a few days leading up to the test, only eat low-fibre foods such as clear soup, white bread and lean meat
take laxatives – you'll be given medication that makes you empty your bowels frequently to take from the day before the test
drink plenty of fluids – this will help to replace the fluids you lose each time you empty your bowels
It's usually a good idea to stay at home the day before the test, as the laxative medication will make you go to the toilet frequently.
Contact the hospital as soon as you receive your appointment letter if you have diabetes or are pregnant (or think you could be pregnant).
Barium enemas aren't done during pregnancy because the X-rays may harm the baby.
If you have diabetes, you'll need to follow special instructions to ensure your blood sugar level is kept under control."
Having a barium enema,"When you arrive at hospital, you'll be asked to change into a hospital gown.
You can take someone with you to the hospital, but they're not usually allowed into the X-ray room.
During the test:
you'll be asked to lie on your side on an X-ray table, and an injection of a medication called Buscopan may be given into your arm or hand to prevent involuntary bowel movements
a small, soft tube will be gently inserted a few centimetres into your bottom, where it will remain throughout the test
the barium is passed through the tube and into your bowel – try to keep the muscles in your bottom tight to prevent it coming back out, but don't worry if some leaks out
you may be asked to move around a bit to help the barium spread along your bowel, and air may be pumped into your bowel to expand it and help push the barium around
several X-rays will be taken with you in different positions
The whole process usually takes around 30 to 45 minutes."
What happens after a barium enema,"When the test is finished, the tube will be removed from your bottom and you can go to the toilet to empty your bowels.
You should be able to go home shortly afterwards, although it's a good idea to take things easy for a few hours before returning to your normal activities.
If you had a Buscopan injection, your vision may be blurry for a short while afterwards, so you won't be able to drive. It's best to arrange for someone to drive you home.
When you get home:
stay close to a toilet for the next few hours, as you may find you need to empty your bowels quite often at first
your poo may be a whitish colour for a few days – this is normal and is just the remaining barium passing out of your body
you can eat and drink as normal – drink plenty of fluids and eat high-fibre foods for the first few days to help stop the barium causing constipation
The X-ray images taken during the test will be analysed by a specialist. A report will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test and you can discuss the results at your next appointment."
Does a barium enema hurt?,"Having a barium enema may be a bit embarrassing and unpleasant, but it shouldn't be painful.
You'll probably feel uncomfortable when the air is pumped into your bowel during the test, similar to the feeling of having trapped wind.
You may have some bloating, wind or stomach cramps for a short while afterwards."
Are there any risks or side effects?,"A barium enema is generally a very safe procedure, although there a few risks and side effects that you should be aware of.
These include:
laxative side effects – side effects such as feeling sick, a mild headache and bloating are common, but shouldn't last long
barium side effects – barium is usually harmless, but it can cause an upset stomach or constipation, and can cause an allergic reaction in very rare cases
radiation exposure – you'll be exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test; this is about the equivalent to what you would receive naturally from the environment over 3 years (for more information, see GOV.UK: patient dose information)
bowel perforation – there's a risk of a small hole developing in your bowel as a result of the procedure, but this is very rare
Your doctor can help you weigh up the risks of the procedure against the benefits of identifying any problem in your bowel."
Symptoms of a Bartholin's cyst,"You may feel a soft, painless lump. This does not usually cause any problems.
But if the cyst grows very large, it can become noticeable and uncomfortable. You may feel pain in the skin surrounding the vagina (vulva) when you walk, sit down or have sex.
The cyst can sometimes affect the outer pair of lips surrounding the vagina (labia majora). One side may look swollen or bigger than usual.
If the cyst becomes infected, it can cause a painful collection of pus (abscess) to develop in one of the Bartholin's glands.
Signs of an abscess include the affected area becoming red, swollen, tender and hot. It can also cause a high temperature."
When to see a GP,"Small Bartholin's cysts are sometimes only found during a routine cervical screening test or an examination carried out for another reason.
Always see a GP if you develop a lump in the area around your vagina so they can confirm a diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions.
If they think the cyst or one of your Bartholin's glands may be infected, they may use a swab to remove a sample of discharge for analysis to identify the bacteria responsible.
Sometimes, a GP may recommend you have a biopsy. A small sample of cyst tissue will be removed and examined under a microscope to check for signs of a rare type of vulval cancer called Bartholin's gland cancer."
What causes Bartholin's cysts?,"The Bartholin's glands are a pair of pea-sized glands found just behind and either side of the lips that surround the entrance to the vagina.
The glands are not usually noticeable because they're rarely larger than 1cm (0.4 inches) across.
The Bartholin's glands secrete fluid that acts as a lubricant during sex. The fluid travels down tiny tubes called ducts into the vagina.
If the ducts become blocked, they can fill with fluid and expand to form a cyst.
It's often not known why the ducts become blocked, but sometimes it's linked to sexually transmitted bacterial infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia, or other bacterial infections, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli)."
How Bartholin's cysts are treated,"If you do not have any noticeable symptoms, it's unlikely you'll need treatment.
If the cyst is painful, a GP may recommend some simple self-care measures, such as soaking the cyst in warm water several times a day for 3 or 4 days and taking painkillers you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket.
If these do not work, several treatments are available to treat the pain and any infection. If necessary, the cyst can be drained. Most of these treatments involve a minor surgical procedure.
A Bartholin's cyst can sometimes return after treatment."
Who's affected,"A Bartholin's cyst usually affects sexually active women aged 20 to 30.
Bartholin's cysts do not usually affect children because the Bartholin's glands do not start functioning until puberty. 
The cysts are also uncommon after the menopause as this usually causes the Bartholin's glands to shrink."
Preventing Bartholin's cysts,"It's not clear exactly why Bartholin's cysts develop, so it's not usually possible to prevent them.
But as some are thought to be linked to STIs, practising safe sex (using a condom every time you have sex) can help reduce your chances of developing Bartholin's cysts.

Check if it's bedbugs,"Bedbugs can be dark yellow, red or brown. Adults are around 5mm long.
Credit:
Bedbugs can hide in many places, including on bed frames, mattresses, clothing, furniture, behind pictures and under loose wallpaper.
Signs of bedbugs include:
bites – often on skin exposed while sleeping, like the face, neck and arms
spots of blood on your bedding – from the bites or from squashing a bedbug
small brown spots on bedding or furniture (bedbug poo)
Bedbug bites can be raised and itchy. They're often in a line or grouped together.
Credit:
On white skin, bedbug bites usually look red. On black or brown skin, they may look purple and may be harder to see.
Some people have a reaction to the bites. They can be very itchy and there may be painful swelling.
A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is also possible but rare."
How you can treat bedbug bites,"Bedbug bites usually clear up on their own in a week or so.
Things you can do include:
putting something cool, like a clean, damp cloth, on the affected area to help with the itching and any swelling
keeping the affected area clean
not scratching the bites to avoid getting an infection
A pharmacist can help with bedbug bites
You can ask a pharmacist about:
mild steroid cream like hydrocortisone cream to ease bedbug bites (children under 10 and pregnant women should get advice from a doctor before using hydrocortisone cream)
antihistamines – these may help if the bites are very itchy and you're unable to sleep
Find a pharmacy"
How to get rid of bedbugs,"If you think you have bedbugs, you should contact your local council or pest control service.
It's very difficult to get rid of bedbugs yourself because they can be hard to find and may be resistant to some insecticides.
There are some things you can try yourself, but these are unlikely to get rid of bedbugs completely.
Do
wash affected bedding and clothing on a hot wash (60C) and tumble dry on a hot setting for at least 30 minutes
put affected clothing and bedding in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer for 3 or 4 days
clean and vacuum regularly – bedbugs are found in both clean and dirty places, but regular cleaning will help you spot them early
Don’t
do not keep clutter around your bed
do not bring secondhand furniture indoors without carefully checking it first
do not take luggage or clothing indoors without checking it carefully if you have come from somewhere where you know there were bedbugs"
Things you can do at home to help with bedwetting,"Do
give your child enough water to drink during the day
make sure your child goes to the toilet regularly, around 4 to 7 times a day, including just before bedtime
agree with your child on rewards for positive actions, such as a sticker for every time they use the toilet before bed
use waterproof covers on their mattress and duvet
make sure they have easy access to a toilet at night
Don’t
do not punish your child – it is not their fault and can make bedwetting worse
do not give your child drinks containing caffeine, such as cola, tea and coffee – this can make them pee more
do not regularly wake or carry your child in the night to use the toilet – this will not help in the long term"
Treatments from a GP,"If your child keeps wetting the bed, a GP will be able to suggest options such as:
a bedwetting alarm
medicine to reduce how much pee your child makes at night
The GP will check if treatment is helping. They'll also be able to offer support if you are finding it hard to cope.
If these treatments do not work, your child may be referred to a specialist."
Causes of bedwetting,"There are many reasons why a child might wet the bed. Causes include:
not feeling the need to pee while sleeping
making too much pee at night
stress at home or at school
Bedwetting may also be caused by an underlying health condition such as diabetes or constipation."
Symptoms of Behçet's disease,"The main symptoms of Behçet's disease include:
genital and mouth ulcers
red, painful eyes and blurred vision
acne-like spots
headaches
painful, stiff and swollen joints
In severe cases, there's also a risk of serious and potentially life-threatening problems, such as permanent vision loss and strokes.
Most people with the condition experience episodes where their symptoms are severe (flare-ups or relapses), followed by periods where the symptoms disappear (remission).
Symptom's often start in adults in their 20s and 30s, but can also start in childhood.
Over time, some of the symptoms can settle down and become less troublesome, although they may never resolve completely.
Read about the symptoms of Behçet's disease"
Diagnosing Behçet's disease,"There's no definitive test that can be used to diagnose Behçet's disease.
Several tests may be necessary to check for signs of the condition, or to help rule out other causes, including:
blood tests
urine tests
scans, such as X-rays, a CT scan or an MRI scan
a skin biopsy
a pathergy test – which involves pricking your skin with a needle to see if a particular red spot appears within the next day or two; people with Behçet's disease often have particularly sensitive skin
Current guidelines state a diagnosis of Behçet's disease can usually be confidently made if you've experienced at least 3 episodes of mouth ulcers over the past 12 months and you have at least 2 of the following symptoms:
genital ulcers
eye inflammation
skin lesions (any unusual growths or abnormalities that develop on the skin)
pathergy (hypersensitive skin)
Other potential causes also need to be ruled out before the diagnosis is made."
Causes of Behçet's disease,"The cause of Behçet's disease is unknown, although most experts believe it's an autoinflammatory condition.
An autoinflammatory condition is where there are repeated episodes of inflammation in the body.
In Behçet's disease, this involves inflammation of the blood vessels. This is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system.
It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, but 2 things are thought to play a role:
genes – Behçet's disease tends to be much more common in certain ethnic groups where the genes that are linked to the condition may be more common
environmental factors – although a specific environmental factor has not been identified, rates of Behçet's disease are lower in people from an at-risk ethnic group who live outside their native country
Behçet's disease is more common in the Far East, the Middle East and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Israel.
People of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Asian origin are thought to be most likely to develop the condition, although it can affect all ethnic groups."
Treating Behçet's disease,"There's no cure for Behçet's disease, but it's often possible to control the symptoms with medicines that reduce inflammation in the affected parts of the body.
These medicines include:
steroids – powerful anti-inflammatory medicines
immunosuppressants – medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system
biological therapies – medicines that target the biological processes involved in the process of inflammation
Your healthcare team will create a specific treatment plan for you depending on your symptoms.

Specialist Behçet's disease centres
There are 3 NHS Centres of Excellence that have been set up to help diagnose and treat people with Behçet's disease in England.
These are located in London, Birmingham and Liverpool.
You may be referred to one of these centres so a diagnosis can be confirmed. Staff at these centres may also liaise with specialists at other centres to help with a person's management and treatment, even if they're not seen directly.
You can find out more about these centres on the Behçet's Syndrome Centres of Excellence website.
If you have Behçet's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Further information about Behçet's disease,"A natural response to receiving a diagnosis of a complex condition such as Behçet's disease is to find out as much as possible about the condition.
However, in the UK this may be difficult because Behçet's disease is so rare that many healthcare professionals know little about it.
A good place to start to learn more about Behçet's disease is from Behçet's UK – the UK's main patient support group for people with Behçet's disease.
Its website has a range of information about different aspects of Behçet's disease, a members' forum, blogs and links to other useful resources."
How to treat diarrhoea and vomiting yourself,"Diarrhoea and vomiting can usually be treated at home. The most important thing is to have lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Do
stay at home and get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash – take small sips if you feel sick
carry on breast or bottle feeding your baby – if they're being sick, try giving small feeds more often than usual
give babies on formula or solid foods small sips of water between feeds
eat when you feel able to – it may help to avoid foods that are fatty or spicy
take paracetamol if you're in discomfort – check the leaflet before giving it to your child
Don’t
do not have fruit juice or fizzy drinks – they can make diarrhoea worse
do not make baby formula weaker – use it at its usual strength
do not give children under 12 medicine to stop diarrhoea
do not give aspirin to children under 16"
How long diarrhoea and vomiting last,"In adults and children:
diarrhoea usually stops within 5 to 7 days
vomiting usually stops in 1 or 2 days"
Diarrhoea and vomiting can spread easily,"Stay off school or work until you've not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least 2 days.
If you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.
To help avoid spreading an infection:
wash your hands with soap and water frequently
wash any clothing or bedding that has poo or vomit on it separately on a hot wash
clean toilet seats, flush handles, taps, surfaces and door handles every day
do not prepare food for other people, if possible
do not share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils
do not use a swimming pool until at least 48 hours after your symptoms stop"
A pharmacist can help with diarrhoea and vomiting,"Speak to a pharmacist if:
you or your child (over 5 years) have signs of dehydration, such as dark, smelly pee or peeing less than usual
you're an older person, have a weakened immune system, or have other health conditions that increase your risk of dehydration
you need to stop diarrhoea for a few hours
They may recommend:
oral rehydration powder that you mix with water to make a drink
medicine to stop diarrhoea for a few hours, like loperamide (not suitable for children under 12)
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of diarrhoea and vomiting,"The most common causes of diarrhoea and vomiting are:
a stomach bug
food poisoning
Other causes of diarrhoea or vomiting"
Symptoms of Bell's palsy,"Symptoms of Bell's palsy include:
weakness on 1 side of your face, or not being able to move 1 side of your face – this usually happens over a few days
a drooping eyelid or corner of your mouth
drooling
a dry mouth
loss of taste
a dry or watering eye
You may also find it difficult to close the eye on the weak side of your face.
Rarely, you may not be able to move both sides of your face."
Treatment for Bell's palsy,"Treatments for Bell's palsy include:
a 10-day course of steroid medicine, sometimes with antiviral medicine
eye drops and ointment to stop the affected eye drying out
surgical tape to keep the eye closed at bedtime
If you cannot close your eye, you may need treatment to prevent damage to your vision."
Recovering from Bell's palsy,"Your Bell's palsy symptoms should get better within 6 months, but it can take longer for some people.
Go back to see a GP if your symptoms are not getting better after 3 weeks.
Some people can have permanent facial weakness and symptoms such as:
pain in their face, around the jaw and behind the ear
a constantly watering eye
difficulty eating and drinking
changes in their sense of taste
difficulty with loud sounds
Living with Bell's palsy can make you feel depressed, stressed or anxious. Speak to a GP if it's affecting your mental health.
You'll usually only get Bell's palsy once, but rarely it can come back, sometimes years later."
Types and grades of non-cancerous brain tumour,"There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumours, which are related to the type of brain cells affected.
Examples include:
gliomas – tumours of the glial tissue, which hold and support nerve cells and fibres
meningiomas – tumours of the membranes that cover the brain
acoustic neuromas – tumours of the acoustic nerve (also known as vestibular schwannomas)
craniopharyngiomas – tumours near the base of the brain that are most often diagnosed in children, teenagers and young adults
haemangioblastomas – tumours of the brain's blood vessels
pituitary adenomas – tumours of the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland on the under surface of the brain
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of brain tumours.
Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to how fast they grow and spread, and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.
Non-cancerous brain tumours are grades 1 or 2 because they tend to be slow growing and unlikely to spread.
They are not cancerous and can often be successfully treated, but they're still serious and can be life threatening."
Symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours,"The symptoms of a non-cancerous brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Some slow-growing tumours may not cause any symptoms at first.
Common symptoms include:
new, persistent headaches
seizures (epileptic fits)
feeling sick all the time, being sick, and drowsiness
mental or behavioural changes, such as changes in personality
weakness or paralysis, vision problems, or speech problems"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, these symptoms need to be assessed by a doctor.
The GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also test your nervous system.
If the GP thinks you may have a brain tumour, or they're not sure what's causing your symptoms, they'll refer you to a brain and nerve specialist called a neurologist."
Causes of non-cancerous brain tumours,"The cause of most non-cancerous brain tumours is unknown, but you're more likely to develop one if:
you're over the age of 50
you have a family history of brain tumours
you have a genetic condition that increases your risk of developing a non-cancerous brain tumour – such as neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, tuberous sclerosis, Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome
you've had radiotherapy"
Treating non-cancerous brain tumours,"Treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour depends on the type and location of the tumour.
Surgery is used to remove most non-cancerous brain tumours, and they do not usually come back after being removed. But sometimes tumours do grow back or become cancerous.
If all of the tumour cannot be removed, other treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, may be needed to control the growth of the remaining abnormal cells."
Recovering from treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour,"After treatment, you may have persistent problems, such as seizures and difficulties with speech and walking. You may need supportive treatment to help you recover from, or adapt to, these problems.
Many people are eventually able to resume their normal activities, including work and sport, but it can take time.
You may find it useful to speak to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of your diagnosis and treatment.
The Brain Tumour Charity has links to support groups in the UK, and Brain Tumour Research also has details of helplines you can contact."
Symptoms of benign prostate enlargement,"The prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder.
If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and the urethra, which is the tube that urine passes through.
This can affect how you pee and may cause:  
difficulty starting to pee
a frequent need to pee
difficulty fully emptying your bladder
Credit:
In some men, the symptoms are mild and do not need treatment. In others, they can be very troublesome."
Causes of benign prostate enlargement,"The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but it's believed to be linked to hormonal changes as a man gets older.
The balance of hormones in your body changes as you get older and this may cause your prostate gland to grow."
Diagnosing benign prostate enlargement,"You might have several different tests to find out if you have an enlarged prostate.
A GP may do some of these tests, such as a urine test, but others might need to be done at a hospital.
Some tests may be needed to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to BPE, such as prostate cancer.
Find out more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement"
Treating benign prostate enlargement,"Treatment for an enlarged prostate will depend on how severe your symptoms are.
If you have mild symptoms, you do not usually need immediate treatment. Your doctor will agree with you if and when you need more check-ups.
You'll probably be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as:
drinking less alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drinks
limiting your intake of artificial sweeteners
exercising regularly
drinking less in the evening
Medicine to reduce the size of the prostate and relax your bladder may be recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of an enlarged prostate.
Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms that have not responded to medicine."
Complications of benign prostate enlargement,"Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as:
a urinary tract infection (UTI)
chronic urinary retention
acute urinary retention
Chronic urinary retention
Chronic urinary retention is when you cannot empty your bladder fully but you can still pee a little.
Symptoms of chronic urinary retention can include:
a weak flow when you pee
leaking pee at night
feeling that your stomach is swollen or that you're not emptying your bladder fully
Chronic urinary retention is usually painless but can slowly stretch your bladder muscle and make it weaker.
Acute urinary retention
Acute urinary retention (AUR) is the sudden inability to pass any urine.
Symptoms of AUR include:
suddenly not being able to pee at all
severe lower tummy pain
swelling of the bladder that you can feel with your hands
Go immediately to your nearest A&E if you experience the symptoms of AUR."
Uses for beta blockers,"Beta blockers may be used to treat:
angina – chest pain caused by narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart
heart failure – failure of the heart to pump enough blood around the body
atrial fibrillation – irregular heartbeat
heart attack – an emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked
high blood pressure – when other medicines have been tried, or in addition to other medicines
Less commonly, beta blockers are used to prevent migraine or treat:
an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
anxiety 
tremor
glaucoma – as eyedrops
There are several types of beta blocker, and each one has its own characteristics. The type prescribed for you will depend on your health condition."
Who can take beta blockers,"Beta blockers are not suitable for everyone. Tell your doctor if you have:
uncontrolled heart failure
had an allergic reaction to a beta blocker or any other medicine in the past
low blood pressure or certain conditions that affect the rhythm of your heart
metabolic acidosis – when there's too much acid in your blood
lung disease or asthma
Tell your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant, are already pregnant or breastfeeding.
It's important not to stop taking beta blockers without seeking your doctor's advice. In some cases, suddenly stopping the medicine may make your health condition worse."
Cautions with other medicines,"There are some medicines that may interfere with the way that beta blockers work, including beta blocker eyedrops.
Tell your doctor if you're taking:
other medicines for high blood pressure. The combination with beta blockers can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. This may make you feel dizzy or faint
other medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainide
other medicines that can lower your blood pressure. These include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an enlarged prostate gland like tamsulosin, or Parkinson's disease medicines such as levodopa
medicines for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
medicines for diabetes, particularly insulin – beta blockers may make it more difficult to recognise the warning signs of low blood sugar
medicines to treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)
medicines for allergies, such as ephedrine, noradrenaline or adrenaline
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. These medicines may increase your blood pressure, so it's best to keep them to a minimum"
Side effects of beta blockers,"Most people taking beta blockers have either no or very mild side effects that become less troublesome with time.
Contact your GP if you're having symptoms that bother you or last more than a few days.
Side effects commonly reported by people taking beta blockers include:
feeling tired, dizzy or lightheaded (these can be signs of a slow heart rate)
cold fingers or toes (beta blockers may affect the blood supply to your hands and feet)
difficulties sleeping or nightmares
difficulty getting an erection or other difficulties with sex
feeling sick
It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking beta blockers.
Tell a doctor straight away if you have:
shortness of breath and a cough that gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, or an irregular heartbeat – these can be signs of heart problems
shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest – these can be signs of lung problems
yellowish skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – these can be signs of liver problems
These are not all the side effects of beta blockers. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.
You can report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme – find out more on the Yellow Card website.
For more information on the side effects of beta blockers, read about the specific medicine you take in our Medicines A to Z."
Missed or extra doses,"Depending on your beta blocker, you can take it up to 4 times a day. Some must be taken once a day, others between 2 and 3 times a day. Check the information included with your medicine.
What if I forget to take it?
If you forget to take a dose of your beta blocker, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.
Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.
If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.
What if I take too much?
If you take more than your prescribed dose, beta blockers can slow down your heart rate and make it difficult to breathe. It can also cause dizziness and trembling.
The amount of beta blocker that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.
Call your doctor, contact 111 or go to A&E straight away if you take too much of your beta blocker."
How you get schistosomiasis,"The worms that cause schistosomiasis live in fresh water, such as:
ponds
lakes
rivers
reservoirs
canals
Showers that take unfiltered water directly from lakes or rivers may also spread the infection, but the worms aren't found in the sea, chlorinated swimming pools or properly treated water supplies.
You can become infected if you come into contact with contaminated water – for example, when paddling, swimming or washing – and the tiny worms burrow into your skin.
Once in your body, the worms move through your blood to areas such as the liver and bowel.
After a few weeks, the worms start to lay eggs. Some eggs remain inside the body and are attacked by the immune system, while some are passed out in the person's pee or poo.
Without treatment, the worms can keep laying eggs for several years.
If the eggs pass out of the body into water, they release tiny larvae that need to grow inside freshwater snails for a few weeks before they're able to infect another person. 
This means it's not possible to catch the infection from someone else who has it."
Symptoms of schistosomiasis,"Many people with schistosomiasis don't have any symptoms, or don't experience any for several months or even years.
You probably won't notice that you've been infected, although occasionally people get small, itchy red bumps on their skin for a few days where the worms burrowed in.
After a few weeks, some people develop:
a high temperature (fever)
an itchy, red, blotchy and raised rash
a cough
diarrhoea
muscle and joint pain
tummy pain
a general sense of feeling unwell
These symptoms, known as acute schistosomiasis, often get better by themselves within a few weeks.
But it's still important to get treated because the parasite can remain in your body and lead to long-term problems."
Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis,"Some people with schistosomiasis, regardless of whether they had any initial symptoms or not, eventually develop more serious problems in parts of the body the eggs have travelled to.
This is known as chronic schistosomiasis.
Chronic schistosomiasis can include a range of symptoms and problems, depending on the exact area that's infected.
For example, an infection in the:
digestive system can cause anaemia, tummy pain and swelling, diarrhoea and blood in your poo
urinary system can cause irritation of the bladder (cystitis), pain when peeing, a frequent need to pee, and blood in your pee
heart and lungs can cause a persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing up blood
nervous system or brain can cause seizures (fits), headaches, weakness and numbness in your legs, and dizziness
Without treatment, affected organs can become permanently damaged."
When to seek medical advice,"Visit your GP if you develop the symptoms above and you've travelled in parts of the world where schistosomiasis is found, or if you're concerned that you may have been exposed to the parasites while travelling.
Tell your GP about your travel history and whether you think you may have been exposed to potentially contaminated water.
If your GP suspects schistosomiasis, they may refer you to an expert in tropical diseases.
The diagnosis is usually made by finding eggs in a sample of your pee or poo. You may also be diagnosed by a blood test."
Treatments for schistosomiasis,"Schistosomiasis can usually be treated successfully with a short course of a medication called praziquantel, which kills the worms.
Praziquantel is most effective once the worms have grown a bit, so treatment may need to be repeated a few weeks after your first dose.
Steroid medication can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of acute schistosomiasis, or symptoms caused by damage to the brain or nervous system."
Preventing schistosomiasis,"There's no vaccine for schistosomiasis, so it's important to be aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid exposure to contaminated water.
You can check whether the area you're visiting is known to have a problem with schistosomiasis using Travel Health Pro's country information section.
If you're visiting one of these areas:
avoid paddling, swimming and washing in fresh water – only swim in the sea or chlorinated swimming pools
boil or filter water before drinking – as the parasites could burrow into your lips or mouth if you drink contaminated water
avoid medicines sold locally that are advertised to treat or prevent schistosomiasis – these are often either fake, sub-standard, ineffective or not given at the correct dosage
don't rely on assurances from hotels, tourist boards or similar that a particular stretch of water is safe – try to find out from an official or reliable source
Quickly drying yourself with a towel after getting out of the water is not a reliable way of preventing infection, although it's a good idea to dry yourself as soon as possible if you're accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated water."
When a biopsy may be needed,"A biopsy can be used to investigate abnormalities, which can be:
functional – such as kidney or liver problems
structural – such as swelling in a particular organ
When the tissue sample is examined under the microscope, abnormal cells may be identified, which can help to diagnose a specific condition.
If a condition has already been diagnosed, a biopsy can also be used to assess its severity (such as the degree of inflammation) and grade (such as the aggressiveness of a cancer).
This information can be very useful when deciding on the most appropriate treatment, and assessing how well a person responds to a particular type of treatment.
It can also be useful in helping to determine a person's overall prognosis (outlook).
Examples of conditions where a biopsy may be helpful include:
cancer
inflammation, such as in the liver (hepatitis) or kidney (nephritis)
infection, such as in lymph nodes – for example, tuberculosis
various skin conditions
It's not usually possible to tell whether a lump or growth on your skin or inside your body is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) by clinical examination alone, which is why a biopsy is often required."
Types of biopsy,"There are various types of biopsy that can be used to help identify a wide range of health conditions.
Different types of biopsy include: 
a punch biopsy – a special instrument punches a small hole in the skin to obtain a skin sample to investigate a skin condition
a needle biopsy – a special hollow needle, guided by X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI scan, is used to obtain tissue from an organ or from tissue underneath the skin
an endoscopic biopsy – an endoscope is used to remove tissue, such as from the stomach during a gastroscopy
an excision biopsy – surgery is used to remove a larger section of tissue
perioperative biopsy – if consent has been given, a perioperative biopsy can be carried out during surgery; in certain circumstances, the sample may be tested straightaway to help guide the surgery or further treatment
How a biopsy is carried out will depend on where the tissue sample is being taken from.
Before the procedure, CT or MRI scanning is often used as a guide to help with this decision.
After the tissue sample is taken, it will be examined under a microscope to help identify the nature of the problem. This often means that a definite diagnosis can be made.
The type of stains and tests that are used when the tissue is examined under the microscope will depend on the medical condition being investigated."
Recovery,"Most biopsies will only require local anaesthetic, which means you won't need to stay in hospital overnight.
But an overnight stay is usually required when the procedure is carried out under general anaesthetic.
Most types of biopsy are painless once the anaesthetic starts to work, although this depends on where the sample is taken.
You may experience a dull ache, which can be treated with painkillers on the advice of your doctor or surgeon.
Some types of biopsy may involve staying in hospital for a few hours.
You may need to have stitches or a dressing applied before you leave.
Read more about recovering from a biopsy."
Getting your results,"How quickly you get the results of a biopsy will depend on the urgency of your case and your local hospital's policy.
Results are often available within a few days. But this is difficult to predict, because further tests may be needed after the first examination of the sample.
It's sometimes necessary to send the microscope slides away to get another specialist opinion.
If a biopsy is carried out during surgery, in some cases a different processing method may be used, known as a frozen section.
This enables the surgeon to get a preliminary result, which can be used to help guide treatment while it's in progress.
Your GP, hospital consultant or practice nurse will give you your results and explain what they mean.
A biopsy is sometimes inconclusive, which means it hasn't produced a definitive result.
In this case, the biopsy may need to be repeated, or other tests may be required to confirm your diagnosis."
Types of birthmark,"There are many different types of birthmark.
Flat, red or pink areas of skin (salmon patches or stork marks)
Credit:
Salmon patches:
are red or pink patches, often on a baby's eyelids, head or neck
are very common
look red or pink on white, brown and black skin
are easier to see when a baby cries
usually fade by the age of 2 when on the forehead or eyelids
can take longer to fade when on the back of the head or neck
Raised red lumps (strawberry marks or haemangiomas)
Credit:
Strawberry marks:
are blood vessels that form a raised red lump on the skin
appear soon after birth
usually look red on white, brown and black skin
are more common in girls, premature babies (born before 37 weeks), low birthweight babies, and multiple births, such as twins
get bigger for the first 6 to 12 months, and then shrink and disappear by the age of 7
sometimes appear under the skin, making it look blue or purple
may need treatment if they affect vision, breathing, or feeding"
Treatment for birthmarks,"Most birthmarks do not need treatment, but some do. This is why it's important to get a birthmark checked if you're worried about it.
A birthmark can be removed on the NHS if it's affecting a person's health. If you want a birthmark removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll have to pay to have it done privately.
Possible treatments for birthmarks include:
medicines – to reduce blood flow to the birthmark, which can slow down its growth and make it lighter in colour
laser therapy – where heat and light are used to make the birthmark smaller and lighter (it works best if started between 6 months and 1 year of age)
surgery – to remove the birthmark (but it can leave scarring)

Things you can do yourself to ease a black eye,"There are things you can do yourself to ease any pain or swelling from a black eye.
Do
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a cloth to the area around your eye for about 10 to 20 minutes at a time, and repeat regularly during the first 1 to 2 days
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, for any pain
after the first 2 days, gently apply a warm (not hot) heat pack or cloth to the area around your eye regularly during the day
Don’t
do not take aspirin unless prescribed by a doctor, as this can make the bruising worse
do not press or rub the area around your eye
do not put ice directly on your skin"
Types of bladder cancer,"Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has spread. 
If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (early bladder cancer). This is the most common type of bladder cancer. 
When the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding bladder muscle, it's referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer (or invasive bladder cancer). This is less common, but has a higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body.
If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's known as advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.
Read more about diagnosing bladder cancer."
Causes of bladder cancer,"Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years. 
Tobacco smoke is a common cause and it's estimated that more than 1 in 3 cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking.
Contact with certain chemicals previously used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since been banned.
Read more about the causes of bladder cancer."
Treating bladder cancer,"In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it's usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact.
This is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medicines directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
In cases with a higher risk of recurrence, medicine known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy.
Most patients will have a choice of either surgery or a course of radiotherapy.
When the bladder is removed, you'll need another way of collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy.
After treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you'll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence.
Read more about treating bladder cancer."
Who is affected?,"About 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year and it's the 11th most common cancer in the UK.
The condition is more common in older adults, with most new cases diagnosed in people aged 60 and above.
Bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the manufacturing industry."
Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis),"The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include:
intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy)
sudden strong urges to pee
needing to pee more often than usual
pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee
waking up several times during the night to pee
Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria).
These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed.
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy.
Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown."
Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis),"Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30.
The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse.
You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks.
It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help."
What causes interstitial cystitis?,"The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it.
These include:
damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves
a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing
your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction
Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests.
BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if:
you have pelvic pain that does not go away
you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life
Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee.
What happens when you see a GP
BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI.
Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help.
A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as:
keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse
stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder
When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist
Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist.
Men may be referred to a urologist."
How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed?,"There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed.
The tests offered may include:
cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope
urine tests
ultrasound, MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too
urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra
vaginal swabs
Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for."
Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis),"When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help.
No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you.
Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why.
Medicines
Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis).
These include:
over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen
medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin
tolterodine, solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee
a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder
pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people)
Bladder instillations
Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter.
These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations.
Examples of intravesical medicines include:
lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder,
a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used
hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining
antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection
As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options.
Supportive therapies and treatments
Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful:
physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain.
acupuncture – may help with pain relief
talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body
pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist
Surgery and procedures
Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work.
Procedures that may be carried out include:
cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser
bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms
botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain.
neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee
In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy).
If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body."
Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis),"Things that may help improve your symptoms include:
reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques
making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day
keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first
stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder"
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you experience any of the above symptoms, particularly if you have persistent abdominal pain, need to pee more frequently, or have blood in your urine.
These symptoms may not necessarily be caused by bladder stones, but need to be investigated further.
If your GP suspects you have a stone in your bladder, you'll be referred to hospital for testing. 
A blood and a urine test will probably be carried out first. A blood test will detect if there's an infection inside your bladder.
The next stage is to take an X-ray of your bladder. Not all types of bladder stones show up clearly on X-rays, so a negative X-ray result doesn't always mean that you don't have bladder stones.
An ultrasound scan may be used instead of an X-ray. Bladder stones can also be identified using a cystoscopy.
This is where a thin fibreoptic tube with a light and a camera at one end (a cystoscope) is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and moved up into the bladder.
The camera relays images to a screen, where they can be seen by the urologist (specialist in treating bladder conditions)."
What causes bladder stones?,"Bladder stones usually form when you can't completely empty your bladder of urine.
A common reason for this in men is having an enlarged prostate gland that blocks the flow of urine.
If urine sits in the bladder for a long time, chemicals in the urine form crystals, which harden into bladder stones.
Read more about the causes of bladder stones and who's at risk."
Treating bladder stones,"Surgery is usually needed to remove the stones from the bladder. The most common procedure is a cystolitholapaxy, where a thin tube (cystoscope) with a camera at the end is used to find the bladder stones.
The cystoscope will then use stone-crushing devices, lasers or ultrasound to break up the stones before they're removed.
Where possible, it's important to treat the underlying causes of bladder stones to prevent new stones developing in the future.
Read more about treating bladder stones."
Preventing bladder stones,"If you have had bladder stones, they can come back. There are things you can do to try to prevent this happening.
You can try to:
increase your daily fluid intake to 2 to 3 litres to lower the concentration of your urine
regularly empty your bladder without delaying
urinate again 10 to 20 seconds after your first attempt (if you're unable to empty your bladder completely first time); this is called double voiding and helps empty the bladder more efficiently
avoid constipation (regular laxatives may be recommended)"
The bladder and kidneys,"The kidneys filter waste products out of the blood, which are mixed with water to create urine. Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder, where it's stored.
When the bladder is full and you're ready to pee, urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra."
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have postmenopausal bleeding, a GP should refer you to hospital or a special postmenopausal bleeding clinic.
You should not have to wait more than 2 weeks to see a specialist.
What happens at your hospital or clinic appointment
A specialist, who may be a nurse, will offer you tests to help find out what's causing the bleeding and plan any necessary treatment.
The tests may include:
a small device being placed in your vagina to scan for any problems (vaginal ultrasound scan)
an examination of your pelvis and vagina – a speculum (plastic device) may be inserted into your vagina to hold it open, so the inside of the vagina and the cervix can be seen
a thin, telescope-like camera being passed up your vagina, through the cervix and into your womb to look for any problems (a hysteroscopy) and to take a tissue sample (biopsy) for testing – under local or general anaesthetic
the specialist pressing on your tummy and inside your vagina to check for lumps, tenderness or other abnormalities"
Causes of postmenopausal bleeding,"There can be several causes of postmenopausal bleeding.
The most common causes are:
inflammation and thinning of the vaginal lining (atrophic vaginitis) or womb lining (endometrial atrophy) – caused by lower oestrogen levels
cervical or womb polyps – growths that are usually non-cancerous
a thickened womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) – this can be caused by hormone replacement therapy (HRT), high levels of oestrogen or being overweight, and can lead to womb cancer
Less commonly, postmenopausal bleeding is caused by cancer, such as ovarian cancer and womb cancer."
Treatment for postmenopausal bleeding,"Treatment for postmenopausal bleeding depends on what's causing it.
Causes and treatment for postmenopausal bleeding
Cause Treatment
Cervical polyps
The polyps may need to be removed by a specialist
Vaginal or endometrial atrophy
You may not need treatment, but may be offered oestrogen cream or pessaries
Endometrial hyperplasia
Depending on the type of hyperplasia, you may be offered no treatment, hormone medicine (tablets or an intrauterine system, IUS) or a total hysterectomy (surgery to remove your uterus, cervix and ovaries)
Side effect of HRT
Changing or stopping HRT treatment
Womb cancer
Total hysterectomy will often be recommended, often followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy, or a combination of treatments
Ovarian cancer
Surgery to remove your ovaries, and sometimes your womb (total hysterectomy). You may also have chemotherapy."
Check if you're bleeding from the bottom,"You might be bleeding from the bottom if you have:
blood on your toilet paper
red streaks on the outside of your poo
pink water in the toilet bowl
blood in your poo or bloody diarrhoea
very dark poo (this can be blood mixed in poo)
A small amount of one-off bleeding can often go away on its own without needing treatment."
What happens at the GP appointment,"If you have bleeding from your bottom, a GP will check what's causing it.
They might:
check your bottom (rectum) with a gloved finger (rectal examination)
ask for a sample of poo for testing
refer you to a specialist for tests
Important:
Bowel cancer risk
Bleeding from the bottom is sometimes a sign of bowel cancer.
This is easier to treat if it's found early, so it's important to get it checked."
Common causes of bleeding from the bottom,"If you have other symptoms, this might give you an idea of the cause.
Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
Bright red blood on toilet paper, streaks on poo, pink toilet water
Blood in poo or blood with slime
Very dark or black blood or poo"
Check if you have blepharitis,"Blepharitis symptoms often come and go.
Symptoms of blepharitis include:
sore eyelids
itchy eyes
a gritty feeling in the eyes
flakes or crusts around the roots of the eyelashes
eyelids sticking together in the morning when you wake up
Credit:"
Things you can do to treat and prevent blepharitis,"Do
clean your eyelids twice a day to start with and then once a day as your symptoms improve
continue to clean your eyes, even if your symptoms clear up
Don’t
do not wear contact lenses while you have symptoms
do not use eye makeup, especially eyeliner and mascara, while you have symptoms
How to clean your eyes
Soak a clean flannel or cotton wool in warm water and place it on your closed eyelid for 5 to 10 minutes.
Gently massage your eyelids for around 30 seconds.
Clean your eyelids using cotton wool or a cotton bud. It might help to use a small amount of baby shampoo in water. Gently wipe along the edge of your eyelids to remove any flakes or crusts.
A pharmacist can help with blepharitis
A pharmacist might be able to suggest things to help keep your eyelids clean, including:
eye pads and wipes
eyedrops
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for blepharitis from a GP,"A GP might suggest using an antibiotic cream or ointment that you rub on your eyelid if your blepharitis does not clear up after cleaning your eyelids regularly.
If blepharitis has caused other problems, such as a lump of fluid under the skin (cyst), antibiotic eyedrops or tablets may be recommended.
If your blepharitis is severe, or if you also have other eye symptoms, the GP may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist)."
Causes of blepharitis,"Blepharitis can be caused by:
a type of bacteria that lives on the skin
a skin condition, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis
the glands inside the eyelids not producing enough oil
Blepharitis cannot be spread to other people."
Specialist referral,"If you're blind or partially sighted, you may be referred to a specialist low-vision clinic, which is often located within a hospital. Staff at the clinic can help you understand your condition and come to terms with your diagnosis.
They can also advise you about practical things, such as lighting and vision aids, and let you know about further sources of help and support.
Ask your local hospital if they have an Eye Clinic Liaison Officer (ECLO), whose role involves providing support to people with vision loss in eye clinics."
Support groups,"If you're blind or partially sighted, you may find it helpful to contact a support group for people with vision loss.
Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)

There are also many local voluntary organisations around the country that help and support people with vision problems. You can find local support organisations on the RNIB's Sightline Directory."
Registering as blind or partially sighted,"If your vision has deteriorated to a certain level, you may choose to register as visually impaired. Depending on the severity of your vision loss you'll either be registered as sight impaired (previously ""partially sighted"") or severely sight impaired (previously ""blind"").
Your eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will measure your ability to see detail at a distance (visual acuity) and how much you can see from the side of your eye when looking straight ahead (your field of vision).
These measurements will help your ophthalmologist determine whether you're eligible to be certified as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. If you are, they will complete an official certificate with the results of your eye examination.
In England and Wales this certificate is called the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI), in Scotland it's called the CVI (Scotland) form, and in Northern Ireland it's called an A655.
Your ophthalmologist will send a copy of the certificate to you, a copy to your GP and a copy to your local social services department. Upon receiving the certificate, your local social services team will contact you to ask whether you want to be added to its register of visually impaired people. If you say ""yes"" then you become registered.
After you're registered, social services will contact you again to arrange for an assessment to be carried out. The aim is to assess your needs and find out what help you require to remain independent, such as help with cleaning and cooking, or help with mobility and transport.
Registering as visually impaired isn't compulsory, but it can help you to get a range of benefits, including:
benefits to help with any costs relating to your disability or illness
a reduction in the TV licence fee
help with NHS costs
help with Council Tax and tax allowances
reduced fees on public transport
parking concessions

Changes to your home,"Most visually impaired people can continue to live at home. However, you'll probably need to make some changes to your home, particularly if you live on your own.
Below is a list of some important pieces of equipment you may find useful.
Big-button telephone – both landline and mobile phones are available from the RNIB online shop.
Computer, smartphone or tablet – the internet can provide a real sense of connection to friends and family as well as other people with a visual impairment. It's also a practical way of finding out information and obtaining goods and services. Big-button keyboards, screen display software and text readers are available from the RNIB.
Community alarm – this small, wearable device has an alarm button which, if pressed, sends an alarm signal to a response centre, which will alert a nominated friend or carer. Your local authority should be able to provide you with further information.
Bright lighting – bright light bulbs and adjustable lights are essential for your home, particularly in the kitchen and the stairs (areas where you're most likely to have an accident). Fluorescent bulbs are recommended because they produce the most light and tend to be cheaper in the long term than conventional bulbs. Lighting in and around the home: A guide to better lighting for people with visual impairment by the Thomas Pocklington Trust, contains more information on the importance of lighting.
The way your house is painted can also make it easier to find your way around. Using a two-tone contrast approach, such as black and white, can make it easier to tell the difference between nearby objects, such as a door and its handle or the stairs and its handrail.
Read more from the RNIB about adapting your home"
Reading and writing,"There are several options available if you're having problems reading standard text in books, newspapers and magazines.
One of the simplest options is to use a magnifying device that can make print appear bigger to help you read. These can be obtained from a number of places including hospital low-vision services, optometrists, local voluntary organisations, and the RNIB.
The RNIB also has a collection of large-print publications you can borrow, as do most libraries.
You could also use an e-reader to help you read. E-readers are handheld devices that allow you to download books and subscribe to newspapers and magazines on the internet. You can choose a setting that allows you to display text at a larger size. Or you can use text-to-speech software.
The RNIB has more information on text-to-speech in eBooks
If you're unable to read at all you could listen to audio recordings. You can sign up to the:
RNIB's Newsagent scheme, which provides more than 200 magazine and newspaper titles in different formats, such as online or on CD.
RNIB Talking Books Service, where you can download audio books to listen to on your smartphone, tablet or computer or on a device known as a DAISY player. You can also get books on CD or USB stick, delivered to your door.
You can also install screen-reading software on your computer that will read out emails, documents and text on the internet.
The RNIB has more information about using screen-reading software
There are also voice recognition programmes where you speak into a microphone and the software translates what you say into writing. These programmes can also be used to issue commands, such as closing down the internet and moving from one website to another.
Braille
Some people with severe sight loss, particularly those who've had the problem from a young age, choose to learn Braille. Braille is a writing system where raised dots are used as a substitute for written letters.
As well as Braille versions of books and magazines, you can buy Braille display units, which can be attached to computers that allow you to read the text displayed on a computer screen. Braille computer keyboards are also available.
The RNIB website has more information about reading and Braille"
Getting around,"There are several different methods you can use to get around independently if you have a problem with your vision.
Long cane
You may find a long cane useful when travelling. These canes are usually foldable and can help you get around by detecting objects in your path. The cane will also make drivers and other pedestrians aware that you have sight loss.
To get the most from a long cane, it's a good idea to attend a training course that will teach you how to use it.
The charity Guide Dogs has more information about getting around safely with a long cane
Guide dogs
Guide Dogs has been providing guide dogs for people with vision loss for many years. Guide dogs can help you get around, and provide both a sense of independence and companionship.
If you apply for a guide dog, Guide Dogs provide all the essential equipment free of charge and can also offer financial assistance if needed for things like food or vet costs.
You don't need to have lost all your sight to benefit from a guide dog and you don't have to be officially registered as blind or partially sighted to apply for one.
Guide Dogs has more on applying for a guide dog
Guide Dogs also offer a number of other services for people with a visual impairment (even if you don't have a guide dog), such as Help for children and families and mobility training.
The Guide Dogs' Sighted guiding service aims to reduce the isolation that many people with sight loss experience, helping to rebuild their confidence and regain their independence.
Global positioning system (GPS)
A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigational aid that uses signals from satellites to tell you where you are and help plan your journeys.
GPS devices are available as standalone units that can be programmed using a Braille keyboard, which tell you your current location and give you directions to where you want to go.
If you have a smartphone, there are a number of GPS apps you can download.
The RNIB website has more information about using GPS
Driving
If you're diagnosed with a condition that affects your vision, you have a legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Failure to do so is a crime and can result in a fine of up to £1,000.
GOV.UK has more on driving with a disability or a health condition
If you're registered as having a sight impairment, the DVLA will assume your driving licence is no longer valid and you'll no longer be able to drive.
Exceptions are occasionally made for people with mild vision impairment. If you think this applies to you, then your doctor will need to fill in a DVLA medical information questionnaire.
You're only legally allowed to drive if you can read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (65 feet), and an eye test shows your visual acuity is at least 6/12. You're allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses when reading the plate or letter chart.
There are also standards relating to your visual field and driving. If you have a condition that may reduce your visual field, the DVLA may ask you to complete a visual field test to demonstrate you're safe to drive."
Technology,"Technology to help you live well and safely with sight loss is developing all the time. You can read:
the RNIB's information on technology and useful products
the Guide Dogs' information on technology for visual impairment"
Employment,"If you're currently employed and have recently been diagnosed with a visual impairment, you should contact the GOV.UK: Access to Work scheme.
Access to Work is a scheme run by Jobcentre Plus that provides advice and support about what equipment and adjustments may be required to enable you to do your job.
They also offer a grant to contribute towards the costs of any equipment or training you may need, such as voice recognition software, a Braille keyboard and display unit and a printer that can convert text into Braille (Braille embossers).
Depending on the size of the company you work for, the grant can pay for 80% to 100% of costs, up to £10,000.

The Thomas Pocklington Trust: employment
You don't have to disclose that you have a visual impairment when applying for a job, but it's usually recommended that you do.
If you feel you've been turned down for a job because of your disability, and you were capable of doing the job, you can make a complaint under the Equality Act 2010.
Some people with a visual impairment decide to become self-employed, often because it allows them the flexibility to work at home for hours they choose.
The RNIB website has more information and advice about equality, rights and employment
Regular sight tests
If you have vision loss, it's still important to have regular sight tests so your optometrist (eye specialist) can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of your vision.

How you can treat a blister yourself,"There are things you can do to protect a blister and help stop it getting infected.
Do
keep the blister as clean as possible – gently wash the skin and pat it dry
cover blisters with a soft plaster or padded dressing
wash your hands before touching a burst blister
allow the fluid in a burst blister to drain before covering it with a plaster or dressing
Don’t
do not burst a blister yourself
do not peel the skin off a burst blister
do not pick at the edges of the remaining skin
do not wear the shoes or use the equipment that caused your blister until it heals
A pharmacist can help with blisters
To protect your blister from becoming infected, a pharmacist can recommend a plaster or dressing to cover it while it heals.
A hydrocolloid dressing (a moist dressing) can protect the blister, help reduce pain and speed up healing.
Find a pharmacy"
Check if you have a blister,"Blisters are small pockets of clear fluid under a layer of skin.
Credit:
Blood blisters may look red or black and are filled with blood instead of clear fluid.
Credit:
An infected blister can be hot and filled with green or yellow pus. The surrounding skin may look red, but this can be hard to see on brown or black skin.
Credit:
Important
Do not ignore an infected blister. Without treatment it could lead to a skin or blood infection."
Treatment for blisters from a GP,"A GP might burst a large or painful blister using a sterilised needle. If your blister is infected, they may prescribe antibiotics.
They can also offer treatment and advice if blisters are caused by a medical condition."
How to prevent blisters,"Blisters develop to protect damaged skin and help it heal. They're mostly caused by friction, burns and skin reactions, such as an allergic reaction.
Blood blisters appear when blood vessels in the skin have also been damaged.
If you often get friction blisters on your feet or hands:
wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes
wear new shoes for short periods of time, until they're comfortable
wear thick socks during exercise, such as moisture-wicking sports socks
change your socks frequently if you get sweaty feet
wear protective gloves when you exercise or if you use tools at work"
Symptoms of bloating,"You may be bloated if:
your tummy feels full or bigger than usual
you have tummy pain or discomfort
your tummy is rumbling or making noises
you're farting more than usual"
Causes of bloating,"The most common reason for bloating is having a lot of gas in your gut.
This can be caused by some food and drinks, such as some vegetables and fizzy drinks, or by swallowing air when you eat.
It can also be caused by a problem with your digestion, such as:
constipation
a food intolerance
coeliac disease
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Some people feel bloated around the time of their period.
Sometimes, bloating that does not go away can be a sign of something more serious such as ovarian cancer."
How to reduce bloating,"Do
exercise regularly to improve your digestion and help prevent bloating – exercise can also help when you're feeling bloated
chew with your mouth closed to avoid swallowing air
drink plenty of water
eat foods high in fibre if constipated
eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large meals
massage your stomach from right to left to release trapped wind
Don’t
do not drink lots of fizzy drinks, alcohol or caffeine in coffee and tea
do not eat lots of foods that are known to cause gas, like cabbage, beans or lentils
do not eat large meals late at night before bed, or slouch when eating
do not eat lots of processed, sugary, spicy or fatty foods
do not eat food you are intolerant to, if you have a food intolerance
A pharmacist can help with bloating
You can ask a pharmacist about:
laxatives to help treat constipation
medicines like Buscopan to help ease the bloating
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for bloating,"Treatment for bloating is often not needed. If you need treatment it will depend on the cause.
A GP may:
refer you to an NHS dietitian if general diet tips, such as cutting down on foods that trigger bloating, are not helping
refer you to a specialist for tests to find out what may be causing your bloating"
What a blood clot in a leg can look like,"Swelling and redness caused by a clot in the left leg
Credit:
Red and swollen right leg caused by a clot
Credit:
A blood clot in a leg is called a DVT (deep vein thrombosis).
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you're struggling to breathe
someone has passed out
This could be a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), which needs to be treated immediately."
Check if you're at risk of blood clots,"Blood clots are rare in young, healthy people.
You're more likely to get them if you:
are staying in or recently left hospital – especially if you cannot move around much (like after an operation)
are overweight
smoke
are using combined hormonal contraception such as the combined pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring
have had a blood clot before
are pregnant or have just had a baby
have an inflammatory condition such as Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis
There are also other things that increase your risk of clots."
How to prevent blood clots,"If you're at a high risk of blood clots – for example, you're in hospital – follow the advice of your care team about preventing clots.
This may involve wearing stockings that improve your blood flow or taking medicine to reduce the risk of clots (anticoagulants).
There are also things you can do to help avoid clots.
Do
stay active – taking regular walks can help
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration – you're more likely to get a clot if you're dehydrated
try to lose weight if you're overweight
wear flight stockings or flight socks to improve your blood flow on long flights – a pharmacist can advise you about this
Don’t
do not sit for long periods without moving, if you can avoid it
do not drink lots of alcohol – this can make you dehydrated
do not smoke"
Antibodies and antigens,"Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.
Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.
Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells."
The ABO system,"There are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:
blood group A – has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma
blood group B – has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma
blood group O – has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma
blood group AB – has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies
Blood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (around 48%) has blood group O.
Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.
This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.
As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.
Find out more about the different blood groups on the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website"
The Rh system,"Red blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative.
This means you can be 1 of 8 blood groups:
A RhD positive (A+)
A RhD negative (A-)
B RhD positive (B+)
B RhD negative (B-)
O RhD positive (O+)
O RhD negative (O-)
AB RhD positive (AB+)
AB RhD negative (AB-)
About 85% of the UK population is RhD positive (35% of the population has O+, the most common type).
In most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies when the blood type is not immediately known.
It's safe for most recipients because it does not have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.
Find out more about the Rh system on the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website"
Blood group test,"To work out your blood group, your red blood cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example, the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you're blood group B), it will clump together.
If the blood does not react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies, it's blood group O. A series of tests with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group.
If you have a blood transfusion (where blood is taken from one person and given to another) your blood will be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens. If there's no reaction, donor blood with the same ABO and RhD type can be used."
Pregnancy,"Pregnant women are always given a blood group test. This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated.
RhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood.
Read more about Rhesus disease."
Giving blood,"Most people are able to give blood, but a lot fewer people than are needed to meet demand actually do.
You can usually donate blood if you:
are fit and healthy
weigh between 50kg (7st 12lb) and 158kg (25st)
are 17 to 65 years old

Check if you have blood in your semen,"Blood in your semen can be:
bright red
pink
brown or reddish-brown
Sometimes there may be small lumps (clots) in the blood.
Depending on the cause, you may also have other symptoms like blood in your pee, pain when peeing or peeing more often than usual."
Causes of blood in semen,"Most of the time it's not obvious what causes blood in semen and it goes away on its own.
But it's important to get it checked to make sure it's nothing serious.
Common causes of blood in semen include:
an infection, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or sexually transmitted infection (STI)
a recent procedure or test, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a cystoscopy or a vasectomy
a problem with the prostate, such as prostatitis or an enlarged prostate
Rarely, blood in semen can be a sign of cancer, such as prostate cancer."
Treatment for blood in semen,"Blood in semen does not usually need to be treated. It often goes away by itself in a few days or weeks.
If a cause can be found, this may need to be treated.
For example, a urinary tract infection (UTI) or sexually transmitted infection (STI) may be treated with antibiotics."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have blood in your pee, a GP will ask about your symptoms and may need to check inside your bottom (rectal examination), and your vagina if you're a woman.
They might also:
ask for a pee sample or arrange a blood test
prescribe antibiotics if they think you have an infection
refer you to a specialist for tests"
Causes of blood in urine,"Blood in your pee could come from anywhere in the urinary tract – the bladder, kidneys or urethra (the tube that carries pee out of the body).
If you have other symptoms, this might give you an idea of the cause. But do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you think it's blood in your pee.
Possible causes of blood in urine
Other symptoms Possible cause
Burning pain when peeing, need to pee often, smelly or cloudy pee, high temperature, pain in sides or lower back Urinary tract infection (UTI)
Bad pain in sides, lower back or groin that comes and goes, unable to lie still, feeling sick Kidney stones
Older men (common in over-50s) finding it difficult to pee, needing to pee suddenly and often, waking up to pee in middle of the night Enlarged prostate
When it might be something else
It may not be blood in your pee if:
you've recently eaten beetroot – this can turn your pee pink
you're taking a new medicine – some medicines can turn pee red or brown
you're bleeding from your bottom instead
it's happening during your period"
Check if it's sepsis,"Sepsis is life threatening. It can be hard to spot.
There are lots of possible symptoms. They can be like symptoms of other conditions, including flu or a chest infection.
If you think you or someone you look after has symptoms of sepsis, call 999 or go to A&E. Trust your instincts.
Immediate action required:

They can tell you what to do, arrange a phone call from a nurse or doctor, or call you an ambulance."
What is sepsis?,"Sepsis is a life-threatening reaction to an infection.
It happens when your immune system overreacts to an infection and starts to damage your body's own tissues and organs.
You cannot catch sepsis from another person.
Sepsis is sometimes called septicaemia or blood poisoning."
What is high blood pressure?,"Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels between heartbeats when blood is pumped around your heart.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg or more if your reading was taken at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic (or an average of 135/85mmHg if it was taken at home)
if you're over the age of 80, high blood pressure is considered to be from 150/90mmHg or more if your reading was taken at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic (or an average of 145/85mmHg if it was taken at home)
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for people over the age of 80 years old is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg if it was taken at home)
Blood pressure readings from 121/81mmHg to 139/89mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Information:
Understanding your blood pressure reading
If you have a recent blood pressure reading use the NHS Check your blood pressure tool to understand what your reading means. You'll also get information about what to do next."
Risks of high blood pressure,"If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions."
Check your blood pressure,"The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 years old are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years. 
Some people from African, Afro-Caribbean or South Asian heritage may have high blood pressure at a younger age and are encouraged to get their blood pressure checked earlier.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at most pharmacies
at your GP surgery
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.

Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure,"It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
have a lot of stress
are over 65 years old
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or Black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
High blood pressure is also sometimes caused by an underlying health condition or taking a certain medicine."
Treatment for high blood pressure,"Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options."
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure,"These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol 
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high."
Medicines for high blood pressure,"If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."
Symptoms of low blood pressure,"Get your blood pressure checked if you keep getting symptoms like:
lightheadedness or dizziness
feeling sick
blurred vision
generally feeling weak
confusion
fainting
This might mean your blood pressure is too low.
If you get symptoms when you stand up or suddenly change position, you may have a type of low blood pressure called postural hypotension."
How to check your blood pressure,"You can check your blood pressure:
by asking if a pharmacist can do it
by asking a practice nurse or GP to do it
at home yourself using a home blood pressure monitor
Low blood pressure is a measurement of less than 90/60mmHg."
Treatment for low blood pressure,"If a cause for low blood pressure can be found, a GP will be able to recommend treatment to ease your symptoms.
For example, they may suggest:
changing medicines or altering your dose, if this is the cause
wearing support stockings – this can improve circulation and increase blood pressure
Medicine to increase blood pressure is rarely needed because simple lifestyle measures or treating the underlying cause is usually effective."
How to ease low blood pressure symptoms yourself,"There are things you can do to help with symptoms of low blood pressure.
Do
get up slowly from sitting to standing
take care when getting out of bed – move slowly from lying to sitting to standing
eat small, frequent meals – lying down or sitting still for a while after eating may also help
increase the amount of water you drink
Don’t
do not sit or stand for long periods
do not bend down or change posture suddenly
do not drink too much alcohol"
Causes of low blood pressure,"Your blood pressure can vary depending on the time of day.
What you're doing and how you're feeling can also affect it.
There are many possible causes of low blood pressure. It may be low because you're fit and healthy, or you may have inherited it from your parents.
Some people develop low blood pressure as they get older.
It can also be caused by:
being pregnant
some medical conditions, such as diabetes
some medicines"
When and where to get your blood pressure tested,"You should have a blood pressure test if you're worried about your blood pressure at any time.
If you're over 40, you can have this test done as part of an NHS Health Check, which is offered to adults in England aged 40 to 74 every 5 years.
If you have been diagnosed with high or low blood pressure, or you have a high risk of developing either, you may need more frequent checks of your blood pressure.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
most pharmacies
your local GP surgery
some workplaces

How blood pressure is tested,"Blood pressure machines vary, but they're all a type of measuring device, which often have an arm cuff attached to it.
The cuff is usually wrapped around your upper arm and filled with air until it feels tight. This can feel uncomfortable but it only lasts a few seconds.
It's important to relax and not talk during this time, because this is when your blood pressure is measured.
If a healthcare professional is doing this for you, they may also use a stethoscope to record your blood pressure.
An automatic device usually picks up the measurements from sensors in the arm cuff, which are sent to a digital display.
You should get the results straight away."
How blood pressure is measured,"Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 numbers:
systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out around your body
diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats and blood is pushed around your heart
The highest number is always the systolic pressure and it's always given first. For example, a blood pressure given as ""120 over 80"" or 120/80mmHg means a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg."
Understanding your blood pressure reading,"Your blood pressure reading can tell you how healthy your blood pressure is.
Information:
If you have a recent blood pressure reading use the NHS Check your blood pressure tool to understand what your reading means. You'll also get information about what to do next.
As a general guide:
normal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg (this applies if it's measured at home or at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic)
high blood pressure is considered to be 135/85 or higher if your reading was taken at home, or 140/90mmHg or higher if your reading was taken at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic
low blood pressure is considered to be 89/59mmHg or lower
If your reading is between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg, you may be at risk of developing high blood pressure in the future. There are things you can do to help prevent high blood pressure."
Testing your blood pressure at home,"Your GP may suggest 24-hour or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) if they think you may have high blood pressure (hypertension).
ABPM tests your blood pressure regularly over 24 hours, by using a cuff attached to a portable device that's worn on your waist.
You can continue with your daily activities during this time.
If you want to regularly check your blood pressure at home, you can buy a machine.
Blood pressure devices for home use
If you want to check your blood pressure regularly at home, you can buy a digital blood pressure machine.
Choose a machine that measures your blood pressure at your upper arm, not your wrist or finger.
Let your GP know you're doing this.

Why a blood test is done,"There are lots of reasons why you may need a blood test.
A blood test may be done to:
check your general health
find out if symptoms you're having are caused by certain conditions
find out if you're more likely to get a condition
find out how well a condition is being treated or managed"
How to get a blood test,"If a healthcare professional such as a GP, nurse or a specialist thinks you need a blood test they will tell you how to book one."
Preparing for a blood test,"The GP, nurse, or specialist should tell you if you need to do anything to prepare for a blood test.
For example, for a short time before some tests, you may need to:
not eat or drink anything other than water (fast)
stop taking certain medicines, such as medicines to help prevent blood clots (anticoagulant medicines)"
What happens at a blood test,"A blood test is usually done at a GP surgery or hospital. The test usually takes about 10 minutes.
A healthcare professional will take a small amount of blood, usually from the inside of your elbow, using a needle. Sometimes blood may be taken from your wrist, or your finger (called a finger-prick test).
A soft strap (tourniquet) may be put around your arm first. This helps to make taking blood easier.
You’ll feel a scratch as the needle goes in, which may be a bit uncomfortable. Your blood will be collected in a small tube which will be sent to a lab for testing.
After the test, you'll usually be given some cotton wool or a plaster to cover the area where the blood was taken.
You may get some bruising or swelling around the area where your blood was taken, but this should go away after a few days.
Information:
If you're worried about needles
Tell the healthcare professional doing your blood test if you're worried about needles. They can help you feel more comfortable during the test.
You can also bring someone with you to the blood test to support you."
Getting your blood test results,"You may get your blood test results after a few days, and usually within a few weeks.
If your blood test result was shared with the GP surgery, you may be able to see it in your GP health record. You may be able to see this online by logging into your account on the NHS website or NHS app.
If you do not hear anything after a few weeks, contact the GP surgery or specialist.
The GP, nurse, or specialist should talk to you about your results and explain what happens next.
If your results do not show anything, you may not need to do anything else. Sometimes you may need other tests, depending on why you had the blood test.
Ask to talk to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your results, or do not understand them."
Why it's done,"A blood transfusion may be needed if you have a shortage of red blood cells.
This may be because your body's not making enough red blood cells or because you have lost blood.
For example, you may need a blood transfusion if you have:
a condition that affects the way your red blood cells work – such as sickle cell disease or thalassaemia
a type of cancer or cancer treatment that can affect blood cells – including leukaemia, chemotherapy or stem cell transplants
severe bleeding – usually from surgery, childbirth or a serious accident
A blood transfusion can replace blood you have lost, or just replace the liquid or cells found in blood (such as red blood cells, plasma or cells called platelets).
Ask your doctor or nurse why they think you might need a transfusion if you're not sure."
What happens,"Before having a blood transfusion, the procedure will be explained to you and you'll be asked to sign a consent form.
A sample of your blood will also be taken to check your blood group.
You'll only be given blood that's safe for someone with your blood group.
During a blood transfusion:
You sit or lie down in a chair or bed.
A needle is inserted into a vein in your arm or hand.
The needle is connected to a tube and a bag of blood.
The blood runs through the tube into your vein.
It can take up to 4 hours to receive 1 bag of blood, but it's usually quicker than this.
You can normally go home soon after, unless you're seriously unwell or need a lot of blood.
How you might feel during and after
You might feel a sharp prick when the needle is first inserted into your vein, but you should not feel anything during the transfusion.
You'll be checked regularly while receiving the blood. Tell a member of staff if you feel unwell or uncomfortable.
Some people develop a temperature, chills or a rash. This is usually treated with paracetamol or by slowing down the transfusion.
Your arm or hand may ache and have a bruise for a few days after.
Contact a GP if you feel unwell within 24 hours of having a blood transfusion, especially if you have difficulty breathing or pain in your chest or back."
Risks,"Blood transfusions are common and very safe procedures.
All donor blood is checked before it's used to make sure it does not contain serious infections such as hepatitis or HIV.
There's a very small risk of complications, such as:
an allergic reaction to the donor blood
a problem with your heart, lungs or immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection)
The risks will be explained before having a transfusion, unless this is not possible – for example, if you need an emergency transfusion.
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any concerns."
Alternatives,"A blood transfusion will only be recommended if it's needed and other treatments will not help.
If it's possible that you'll need a transfusion (for example, if you're due to have surgery or you have anaemia), you may sometimes be given medicine to:
lower your risk of bleeding, such as tranexamic acid
boost your number of red blood cells, such as iron tablets or injections
These can reduce your chances of needing a blood transfusion."
Giving blood afterwards,"Currently, you cannot give blood if you had a blood transfusion after 1 January 1980.
This is a precautionary measure to reduce the risk of a serious condition called variant CJD (vCJD) being passed on by donors.
Find out more about who can give blood on the NHS Blood and Transplant website."
How to tell if you have blue or grey skin or lips (cyanosis),"If you have cyanosis, you may notice a blue or grey colour on your:
lips
tongue
gums
skin (black or brown skin may turn grey - this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids)
ears
under your nails
Your hands and feet are usually a normal temperature. They may be cold if you also have poor blood circulation, which can be a cause of cyanosis."
Causes of blue or grey skin or lips (cyanosis),"Blue or grey skin or lips (cyanosis) happens when there's not enough oxygen in your blood, or you have poor blood circulation.
It can be caused by a serious problem with the:
lungs, like asthma or pneumonia
airways, like choking or croup
heart, like heart failure or congenital heart disease
Other causes of cyanosis include:
Raynaud's, which affects your fingers and toes
beta blockers, medicines used to treat high blood pressure
a blood clot that stops the blood supply to a limb
being in cold air or water
wearing clothing or jewellery that's too tight"
Treatment for blue or grey skin or lips (cyanosis),"Cyanosis is a symptom of many different conditions.
Treatment depends on the cause."
How to help stop yourself blushing,"Do
try to relax and do breathing exercises to help reduce stress and anxiety
keep cool by removing a layer of clothing and drinking water
wear make-up that reduces the redness of your skin in stressful situations like an interview or when giving a presentation
Don’t
do not eat spicy foods or drink alcohol or hot drinks if they make you blush"
Common causes of blushing,"Lots of different things can cause blushing. It's often caused by feeling embarrassed, hot or anxious.
Sometimes other symptoms you have might give you an idea of what's causing it.
Symptoms and possible causes of blushing
Symptoms Possible causes
A red face most of the time, small blood vessels can be seen under your skin, spots Rosacea
Hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, low mood, reduced sex drive Menopause
Sweating a lot, particularly in your armpits, hands, feet, face and groin Excessive sweating
Swelling in your neck, anxiety and irritability, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, tiredness Overactive thyroid
Some medicines can also cause blushing. Check the side effects of any medicine you're taking to see if blushing or flushing is listed."
Treatments from a GP,"Treatment for blushing will depend on the cause.
For example, your GP may suggest:
a talking therapy like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) if your blushing is caused by stress or anxiety
medicines to help reduce anxiety, stop blushing or treat an underlying condition
Very rarely, surgery may be an option if blushing is severe and other treatments have not helped. But this can cause serious and long-lasting side effects."
Symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),"You might have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) if you:
worry a lot about a specific area of your body (particularly your face)
spend a lot of time comparing your looks with other people's
look at yourself in mirrors a lot or avoid mirrors altogether
go to a lot of effort to conceal flaws – for example, by spending a long time combing your hair, applying make-up or choosing clothes
pick at your skin to make it ""smooth""
BDD can seriously affect your daily life, including your work, social life and relationships.
BDD can also lead to depression, self-harm and even thoughts of suicide."
Getting help for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),"You should see a GP if you think you might have BDD.
They'll probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect your life.
They may also ask if you've had any thoughts about harming yourself.
You may be treated by the GP, or they may refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.
It can be very difficult to seek help for BDD, but it's important to remember that you have nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about.
Getting help is important because your symptoms probably will not go away without treatment and may get worse.
You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
Find an NHS talking therapies service"
Treatments for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),"The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can get better with treatment.
If your symptoms are relatively mild, you should be referred for a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which you have either on your own or in a group.
If you have moderate symptoms, you should be offered either CBT or a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
If your symptoms are more severe, or other treatments do not work, you should be offered CBT together with an SSRI."
Causes of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),"It's not known exactly what causes body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), but it might be associated with:
genetics – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you have a relative with BDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression
a chemical imbalance in the brain
a traumatic experience in the past – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you were teased, bullied or abused when you were a child
Some people with BDD also have another mental health condition, such as obsessive compulsive behaviour (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder."
Things you can do to help with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),"Support groups for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
Some people may find it helpful to contact or join a support group for information, advice and practical tips on coping with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).
You can ask your doctor if there are any groups in your area, and the BDD Foundation has a directory of local and online BDD support groups.
You may also find the following organisations to be useful sources of information and advice:
Anxiety UK
International OCD Foundation
Mind
OCD Action
OCD UK
Mental wellbeing
Things that can help with your mental wellbeing if you have BDD include:
taking regular exercise
making sure you get enough sleep
Some people also find it helpful to get together with friends or family, or to try doing something new to improve their mental wellbeing.
It may also be helpful to try some relaxation and breathing exercises to relieve stress and anxiety."
How to treat body odour yourself,"Do
wash your armpits, groin and feet at least twice a day with soap and dry thoroughly
shave your armpits regularly
use antiperspirants and deodorants
change and wash your clothes regularly
wear natural fabrics like cotton, wool and silk
wear antibacterial socks
Don’t
do not eat too much strong smelling or spicy food
do not drink too much coffee or alcohol
A pharmacist can help with body odour
You can ask a pharmacist about:
stronger antiperspirants
armpit or sweat shields to protect your clothing
foot powders for sweaty feet
soap substitutes that are gentler on your skin
Find a pharmacy"
Treatments from a GP,"If you have severe body odour and sweating, a GP may suggest:
stronger, prescription antiperspirants
injections in your armpits to reduce the amount of sweat
surgery to remove the sweat glands"
Causes of body odour,"Things that can make body odour worse include:
exercise
hot weather
hormonal changes
being overweight
having a condition like diabetes, kidney disease or liver disease
certain types of medicine, such as antidepressants
Body odour may also be linked to excessive sweating and smelly feet."
Check if you have a boil,"A boil often starts as an itchy or tender spot.
Credit:
Boils can sometimes leak pus.
Credit:
Boils can appear anywhere on your body.
Credit:
When lots of boils form together it's called a carbuncle.
Credit:"
Things you can do to help boils,"There are things you can do to treat boils yourself and stop them coming back.
Do
soak a clean cloth in warm water and hold it against the boil for 10 minutes 4 times a day
clean the area around the boil with antibacterial soap if pus comes out
cover the area with a dressing or gauze until it heals
bathe or shower every day and wash your hands regularly
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain
wash your towels and bedding at least once a week at high temperature
try to lose weight if you are very overweight and have boils between folds of your skin
Don’t
do not pick, squeeze or pierce a boil
do not share your towel with other people until the boil has gone
do not go to a swimming pool or gym until the boil has gone –⁠ you could pass the infection on to others"
Treatment for boils,"A GP can check if you need treatment.
You may need:
a small procedure to drain the boil to get rid of the pus
antibiotics"
Causes of boils,"You may be more likely to get boils if you have a long-term condition that affects your immune system, such as diabetes or HIV.
You may also be more likely to get boils if:
you're a man
you've been in close contact with someone with boils
you have certain skin conditions, such as eczema
you take certain medicines, such as steroids
you’re living with obesity or malnutrition
Carbuncles are less common and mostly affect middle-aged men."
Signs and symptoms of bone cancer,"Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.
The main symptoms include:
persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night
swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint
a noticeable lump over a bone
a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal
problems moving around – for example, walking with a limp
If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP.
While it's highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.
Read more about the symptoms of bone cancer."
Types of bone cancer,"Some of the main types of bone cancer are:
osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20
Ewing sarcoma – which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20
chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40
Young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop.
The above types of bone cancer affect different types of cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have."
What causes bone cancer,"In most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer.
You're more at risk of developing it if you:
have had previous exposure to radiation during radiotherapy
have a condition known as Paget's disease of the bone – however, only a very small number of people with Paget's disease will actually develop bone cancer
have a rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome – people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells
Read more about the causes of bone cancer."
How bone cancer is treated,"Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.
Most people have a combination of:
surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, but amputation is sometimes necessary
chemotherapy – treatment with powerful cancer-killing medicine
radiotherapy – where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells
In some cases of osteosarcoma, a medicine called mifamurtide may also be recommended.
Read more about treating bone cancer."
Outlook,"The outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).
Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn't spread.
Overall, around 6 in every 10 people with bone cancer will live for at least 5 years from the time of their diagnosis, and many of these may be cured completely.
Cancer Research UK: statistics and outlook for bone cancer"
Symptoms of a bone cyst,"Symptoms of a bone cyst can include:
pain, swelling or a lump, usually in your arm, leg or spine
numbness or tingling, if the cyst affects your spine
a break (fracture), sometimes from a relatively minor injury
Bone cysts do not always cause symptoms. Sometimes they're found after they cause a fracture, or if you have an X-ray for another reason."
Treatments for bone cysts,"If the bone cyst is small
A bone cyst may not need treatment if it's small and not causing any problems.
They often get better on their own, especially in children and teenagers.
You may have regular X-rays for a few years to check your bone is healing and the cyst is not getting bigger.
If the bone cyst is large or causing problems
A bone cyst might need to be treated if it's:
large or getting bigger – this could make the bone weaker and more likely to break (fracture) if you injure it
causing problems like pain, swelling or a lump
The main treatments are:
draining the fluid with a needle and injecting medicine into the bone to help it heal – this may need to be done several times over a few months
cutting or scraping out the cyst – the hole may be filled with small pieces of bone taken from another part of your body or from a donor, or with a bone cement mixture
Treatment is done under general anaesthetic. You will not usually need to stay in hospital overnight."
Recovering after treatment for a bone cyst,"If you have treatment for a bone cyst it normally takes at least a few months for the bone to heal.
You may need to avoid activities or sports that could damage the bone until it has healed.
You'll have regular X-rays for a few years to check it's getting better.
It's quite common for bone cysts to come back, especially in the first couple of years after treatment."
Causes of bone cysts,"The exact cause of bone cysts is unknown. They're not cancer and do not spread to other parts of the body.
The main types of cyst are thought to have different causes:
unicameral bone cysts – fluid-filled holes that may form if fluid does not drain properly from a bone as it's growing
aneurysmal bone cysts – blood-filled holes that may be caused by a problem with the blood vessels in a bone (possibly due to an injury or a non-cancerous growth)"
Who needs to have a bone density scan,"You may need to have a bone density scan if you're:
over 50 with a risk of developing osteoporosis
under 50 with other risk factors, such as smoking or a previous broken bone
The results from a bone density scan are usually used alongside a fracture risk assessment to assess your chances of osteoporosis and breaking a bone.
Osteoporosis can affect anyone at any age, although older postmenopausal women are particularly at risk.
This is because the level of oestrogen declines after the menopause, resulting in a decrease in bone density.
The more dense your bones, the stronger and less likely they are to break (fracture). Osteoporosis does not cause any symptoms until a bone is broken.
Find out when bone density scans are used"
Measuring bone density,"During a bone density scan, a type of X-ray called dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is passed through your body. This is shortened to DEXA.
Some radiation is absorbed by the bone and soft tissue, and some travels through your body.
Special detectors in the DEXA machine measure how much radiation passes through your bones, and this information is sent to a computer.
Your bone density measurements will be compared with the bone density of a young healthy adult or an adult of your own age, gender and ethnicity.
Find out more about how bone density scans are performed"
How safe are bone density (DEXA) scans,"Bone density scans are very safe. They use a much lower level of radiation than standard X-rays, which means that the radiographer (the technical specialist carrying out the scan) can stay in the scanning room with you during the scan.
Despite being very safe, bone density scans and X-rays are not recommended for pregnant women, as X-rays can damage an unborn child.
Find out about pregnancy care and the scans and tests you can have"
Symptoms of botulism,"The time it takes to develop symptoms can vary from a few hours to several days after exposure to the Clostridium botulinum bacteria or their toxins.
Depending on the exact type of botulism, some people initially have symptoms such as feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), stomach cramps, diarrhoea or constipation.
Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs.
Symptoms can include:
drooping eyelids
blurred or double vision
facial muscle weakness
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
slurred speech
breathing difficulties
Affected babies may also have a weak cry, find it difficult to feed, and have a floppy head, neck and limbs."
When to get medical advice,"Botulism is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.
Go to your nearest A&E department or immediately dial 999 if you or someone you know has symptoms of botulism.
Treatment is more effective the earlier it's started."
Causes and types of botulism,"Clostridium botulinum bacteria are found in soil, dust and river or sea sediments.
The bacteria themselves are not harmful, but they can produce highly poisonous toxins when deprived of oxygen, such as in closed cans or bottles, stagnant soil or mud, or occasionally, the human body.
There are 3 main types of botulism:
food-borne botulism – when someone eats food containing the toxins because it has not been properly canned, preserved or cooked
wound botulism – when a wound becomes infected with the bacteria, usually as a result of injecting illegal drugs like heroin contaminated with the bacteria into muscle rather than a vein
infant botulism – when a baby swallows a resistant form of the bacteria, called a spore, in contaminated soil or food, such as honey (these spores are harmless to older children and adults because the body develops defences against them from about the age of 1)
All these types of botulism are rare in the UK, but occasional cases do occur."
Treatment for botulism,"Botulism needs to be treated in hospital.
The way it's treated depends on the type of botulism, but usually involves:
neutralising the toxins with injections of special antitoxins or antibodies
supporting the functions of the body, such as breathing, until you recover
Treatment will not immediately reverse any paralysis that's already been caused by the toxin, but will stop it getting any worse.
In most people, paralysis that occurred before treatment will gradually improve over the following weeks or months."
Preventing botulism,"Food-borne botulism
As a result of high standards of food hygiene in the UK, the chances of getting food-borne botulism from food bought in this country are low.
There's a slightly higher risk if you produce your own food, particularly if this involves canning.
But following food hygiene procedures and canning recommendations will reduce any risk.
Do not eat food from bulging or damaged cans, and avoid eating foul-smelling preserved foods, foods stored at the incorrect temperature and out-of-date foods.
Infant botulism
In many cases of infant botulism, the specific cause is not identified so it may not always be possible to prevent it.
But you should avoid giving honey to babies under the age of 1 as it's been known to contain Clostridium botulinum spores.
Wound botulism
People who inject heroin can get botulism. This is often through injecting heroin, contaminated with the bacteria, into the skin or muscles.
The best way to avoid getting botulism is to stop using heroin. Find out more about how to get help for heroin addiction.
GOV.UK has more information about how to reduce your risk of getting botulism if you do inject heroin"
Why screening is offered,"Regular NHS bowel cancer screening reduces the risk of dying from bowel cancer.
Bowel cancer is the 4th most common type of cancer. Screening can help prevent bowel cancer or find it at an early stage, when it's easier to treat."
How to get a home test kit,"Everyone aged 60 to 74 years who is registered with a GP and lives in England is automatically sent an NHS bowel cancer screening kit every 2 years.
The programme is expanding so that everyone aged 50 to 59 years will be eligible for screening. This is happening gradually over 4 years and started in April 2021 with 56 year olds.
The programme has also started to include 58 year olds, so you may get a test before you're 60.
Make sure your GP practice has your correct address so your kit is posted to the right place.
If you're 75 or over, you can ask for a kit every 2 years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 60 60.
If you're worried about a family history of bowel cancer or have any symptoms, speak to a GP for advice."
How to use the home test kit,"The NHS bowel cancer screening kit used in England is the faecal immunochemical test kit – known as the FIT kit.
You collect a small sample of poo on a small plastic stick and put it into the sample bottle and post it to a lab for testing.
There are instructions that come with the kit.
You can also find NHS bowel cancer screening kit instructions on GOV.UK

Your test result,"Your test result should be posted to you within 2 weeks of sending off your kit.
There are 2 types of result:
No further tests needed
Further tests needed
No further tests needed
This result means:
no blood was found in your poo sample, or only a tiny amount was found
you do not need to do anything at this time
you'll be invited to do another screening test in 2 years (if you'll still be under 75 by then)
This is not a guarantee that you do not have bowel cancer. See a GP if you have or get symptoms of bowel cancer, even if you have already done a screening kit.
About 98 in 100 people do not need further tests.
Further tests needed
This result means:
blood was found in your poo sample
you do not necessarily have bowel cancer (the blood could be the result of something like piles) but you'll be offered an appointment to talk about having another test called a colonoscopy to look for the cause
A colonoscopy is where a thin tube with a camera inside is passed into your bottom to look for signs of bowel cancer.
Read a leaflet about the colonoscopy test on GOV.UK
About 2 in 100 people are asked to have further tests."
Risks of screening,"No screening test is 100% reliable.
There's a chance a cancer could be missed, meaning you might be falsely reassured.
There's also a small risk that the colonoscopy test you might have if screening finds something unusual could damage your bowel, but this is rare."
Bowel cancer screening for people with Lynch syndrome,"If you've been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, you'll be offered a colonoscopy every 2 years through the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.
This is because Lynch syndrome can increase your chance of getting bowel cancer and screening through a colonoscopy reduces the chance of becoming seriously ill or dying from bowel cancer.
The age you will be invited for a colonoscopy will depend on which variant of Lynch syndrome you have.
Find out more about colonoscopies for people with Lynch syndrome on GOV.UK"
More information and advice,"Call the free NHS bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 60 60 if:
you have not had your result after 2 weeks from when you sent off your kit

Signs and symptoms,"Bowel incontinence can affect people in different ways.
You may have a problem if:
you have sudden urges to poo that you cannot control
you soil yourself without realising you needed the toilet
you sometimes leak poo – for example, when you fart
it happens every day or from time to time – a one-off ""accident"" when you're ill with diarrhoea is not usually a problem
it's affecting your daily life – for example, it stops you socialising
You may also have other symptoms, such as constipation, diarrhoea, farting or bloating."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have difficulty controlling your bowels. Do not be embarrassed about talking to someone about it.
Remember that:
it's not something to be ashamed of
it's common and GPs are used to seeing people with it
it's not something you have to put up with
it will probably not get better on its own
it can be treated
If you'd prefer not to see a GP, you may be able to make an appointment at an NHS continence service instead. Call your local hospital for details of your nearest service."
Treatments for bowel incontinence,"Treatment can help improve bowel incontinence and reduce the impact it has on your life. The best treatment for you depends on what's causing the problem.
Treatments for bowel incontinence include:
incontinence products – such as pads you wear in your underwear or small plugs you put in your bottom
changes to your diet – such as avoiding foods that make diarrhoea worse
medicines to reduce constipation or diarrhoea
pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the muscles used to control your bowels
Surgery may be considered if other treatments do not help.
Read more about treatments for bowel incontinence"
Causes,"There are lots of possible causes of bowel incontinence. Often it's caused by a combination of problems.
Causes of bowel incontinence include:
severe or long-lasting constipation or diarrhoea
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
severe piles (haemorrhoids)
childbirth or surgery damaging the muscles or nerves you use to control your bowels
conditions that can affect the nerves in your bottom – such as diabetes, a stroke or spina bifida
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your problems. Get medical help so the underlying cause can be identified and treated."
More information,"For more advice, information and support, see:
Bladder & Bowel Community: including more on treatments, ways to cope and patient stories"
Symptoms of bowel polyps,"Bowel polyps do not usually cause any symptoms, so most people with polyps will not know they have them.
They are often found during a colonoscopy, for example if you're being checked for another bowel condition, like bowel inflammation or cancer.
Rarely, larger polyps can cause symptoms such as:
a small amount of slime (mucus) or blood in your poo
bleeding from your bottom
a change in your normal bowel habits, such as diarrhoea or constipation
losing weight without trying"
Bowel polyps and bowel cancer,"Polyps are usually harmless and do not become cancerous. But in a small number of cases a polyp can become cancerous over many years.
Bowel cancer screening can help find polyps that are more likely to develop into bowel cancer. These polyps are then removed."
Diagnosing bowel polyps,"If your GP thinks your symptoms could be caused by bowel polyps, they may recommend a colonoscopy or a CT colonography.
Colonoscopy
A colonoscopy is where a long, thin flexible tube with a small camera at the end (a colonoscope) is passed into your bottom and guided up into your bowel to look for polyps.
A colonoscopy should not be painful, but can feel uncomfortable.
CT colonography
A CT colonography scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a detailed image of your bowel and show any polyps. You'll be given special liquid before the scan so that your bowel can be seen clearly."
Treatment for bowel polyps,"Bowel polyps are usually removed while having a colonoscopy.
A wire loop that is part of the colonoscope will cut off (snare) or burn off (cauterise) the polyp. This is called a polypectomy and is painless.
Rarely, when there are lots of polyps or a polyp is very large, surgery may be needed to remove part of the bowel.
After treatment
After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they're sent to a lab to check if:
the polyp has been completely removed
there's any risk of it regrowing
there's any cancerous changes in the polyp
If there are cancerous changes in the polyp, you may need further treatment. Your specialist will advise you about this."
Causes of bowel polyps,"The exact cause of bowel polyps is not known. It's thought they're caused by the body producing too many cells in the lining of the bowel.
These extra cells then form into a bump, which is the polyp.
You may be more likely to develop bowel polyps if:
a member of your family has had bowel polyps or bowel cancer
you're over 50 (around 1 in 4 people over 50 will have at least 1 polyp)
you have inflammatory bowel disease, which includes ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease
you're overweight or smoke"
Is Bowen's disease serious?,"Bowen's disease itself is not usually serious. It tends to grow very slowly over months or years, and there are several very effective treatments for it.
The concern is that Bowen's disease can eventually develop into a different type of skin cancer called squamous cell skin cancer if it's left undiagnosed or neglected.
It's estimated this happens in up to 1 in 20 to 1 in 30 people with untreated Bowen's disease.
Squamous cell skin cancer is often treatable, but it can spread deeper into the body and is sometimes very serious."
Symptoms of Bowen's disease,"Bowen's disease usually appears as a patch on the skin that has clear edges and does not heal.
Some people have more than 1 patch.
Credit:
The patch may be:
scaly or crusty
flat or raised
up to a few centimetres across
itchy (but not all the time)
red or pink on white skin, but this may be harder to see on brown and black skin
The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but is especially common on exposed areas like the lower legs, neck and head.
Sometimes they can affect the groin area and, in men, the penis.
If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer) or develops a lump, it could be a sign it's turned into squamous cell skin cancer."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have a persistent red or scaly patch of skin and do not know the cause.
It's important to get a proper diagnosis, as Bowen's disease can look like other conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema.
If necessary, your GP will refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) to determine what the problem is.
If they are not sure about the cause, they may need to remove a small sample of skin so it can be looked at more closely (a biopsy)."
Causes of Bowen's disease,"Bowen's disease usually affects people in their 60s and 70s.
The exact cause is unclear, but it's been closely linked with:
long-term exposure to the sun or use of sunbeds – especially in people with fair skin
having a weak immune system – for example, it's more common in people taking medicine to suppress their immune system after an organ transplant, or those with AIDS
previously having radiotherapy treatment
the human papillomavirus (HPV) – a common virus that often affects the genital area and can cause genital warts
Bowen's disease does not run in families and it's not infectious."
Treatments for Bowen's disease,"There are a number of treatment options for Bowen's disease. Talk to your dermatologist about which treatment is most suitable for you.
The main treatments are:
cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is sprayed on to the affected skin to freeze it. The procedure may be painful and the skin may remain a bit uncomfortable for a few days. The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks.
imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) – this is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better.
curettage and cautery – the affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic, where the skin is numbed, and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks.
photodynamic therapy (PDT) – a light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin and a laser is directed on to the skin a few hours later to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session usually lasts between 8 to 45 minutes. You may need more than 1 session.
surgery – the abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards.
In some cases, your dermatologist may just advise monitoring your skin closely – for example, if it's very slow growing and they feel the side effects of treatment will outweigh the benefits."
Looking after your skin after treatment,"After having treatment for Bowen's disease, you may need follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or GP to see if you need any further treatment.
If you had surgery, you may need to have any stitches removed at your GP surgery 5 to 14 days later or once your wound has healed. Sometimes dissolvable stitches are used that do not need to be removed.
If you had a dressing on your wound, you may need to go to your GP or the hospital to have it changed.
After treatment:
see a GP if an existing patch starts to bleed, change in appearance or develops a lump – do not wait for your follow-up appointment
see a GP if you notice any new patches on your skin
make sure you protect your skin from the sun – wear protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30
Get more advice on sunscreen and sun safety"
What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly?,"The skull is made up of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older.
A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head.
Reasons why this may happen include:
sleeping on their back – the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
problems in the womb – pressure can be placed on a baby's head before they're born if they're a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion them
being born prematurely – premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born, and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first as they're not yet able to move their head themselves
neck muscle tightness – this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure
Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis."
When to get medical advice,"Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head.
They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help.
A slightly flattened head is not usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse."
What you can do,"The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around and crawling.
To take pressure off the flattened part of your baby's head:
give your baby time on their tummy during the day – encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them
switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface – this ensures there is not constant pressure on one part of their head
change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot – this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side
alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying
reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams – try using a sling or front carrier when practical
If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. 
Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis.
Find out more about how craniosynostosis is treated"
"Helmets, headbands and mattresses","There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow.
These devices apply pressure to ""bulging"" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas.
Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around 5 or 6 months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months.
But these helmets and headbands generally are not recommended because:
there is not clear evidence to suggest they work
they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes
they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000
your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments
they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby
Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull.
These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help."
Will my child's head shape return to normal?,"Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures described on this page, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement.
Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're 1 or 2 years old any flattening will be barely noticeable.
More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain.
The appearance of your child's head should improve as they become more mobile and their hair grows.
It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age.
You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. 
You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense and possible discomfort for you and your child."
Symptoms of a brain abscess,"The symptoms of a brain abscess may develop quickly or slowly but can include:
headache – which is often severe, located in a single section of the head and cannot be relieved with painkillers
changes in mental state – such as confusion or irritability
problems with nerve function – such as muscle weakness, slurred speech or paralysis on one side of the body
a high temperature
seizures (fits)
feeling sick
being sick
stiff neck
changes in vision – such as blurring, greying of vision or double vision (due to the abscess putting pressure on the optic nerve)"
When to get medical advice,"Any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain and nervous system should be treated as a medical emergency. These include:
slurred speech
muscle weakness or paralysis
seizures occurring in a person with no previous history of seizures
If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.
Any symptoms that suggest a worsening infection, such as a high temperature or being sick, should be reported to your GP immediately.
If your GP is not available, contact your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111."
Causes of a brain abscess,"There are 3 main ways a brain abscess can develop. These are:
an infection in another part of the skull – such as an ear infection, sinusitis or dental abscess, which can spread directly into the brain
an infection in another part of the body – for example, the infection that causes pneumonia spreading into the brain via the blood
trauma, such as a head injury – that cracks open the skull, allowing bacteria or fungi to enter the brain
However, in some cases, the source of the infection remains unknown.
Read more about the causes of a brain abscess."
Diagnosing a brain abscess,"If a brain abscess is suspected, an initial assessment will be made based on your symptoms, medical history and whether you've had a recent infection or a weakened immune system.
Blood tests can also be carried out to check for an infection.
If you're referred to hospital for further tests, you may have either:
a CT scan – a series of X-rays are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body
an MRI scan – which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body.
If an abscess is found, a procedure known as CT-guided aspiration may be used to remove a sample of pus for testing. This involves using a CT scan to guide a needle to the site of the abscess."
Treating a brain abscess,"A brain abscess is regarded as a medical emergency. Swelling caused by the abscess can disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. There's also a risk of the abscess bursting (rupturing).
If left untreated, a brain abscess can cause permanent brain damage and could be fatal.
A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of:
medicines – either antibiotics or antifungals
surgery – either draining the pus through a hole in the skull (simple aspiration) or opening the skull and removing the abscess entirely (craniotomy)
Treatment with antibiotics often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed, to reduce the risk of complications.
Read more about treating a brain abscess."
Complications of a brain abscess,"Complications of a brain abscess can include:
a reoccurring abscess – seek immediate medical advice if you think there's even a small chance your abscess has reoccurred; this is more common in people with a weakened immune system or cyanotic heart disease
brain damage – mild to moderate brain damage often improves with time but severe brain damage is likely to be permanent; brain damage is more of a risk if diagnosis and treatment are delayed
epilepsy – where a person has repeated seizures (fits)
meningitis – a life-threatening infection of the protective membranes around the brain, which requires urgent treatment; this is more common in children"
Brain death is legal death,"If someone is brain dead, the damage is irreversible and, according to UK law, the person has died.
It can be confusing to be told someone has brain death, because their life support machine will keep their heart beating and their chest will still rise and fall with every breath from the ventilator.
But they will not ever regain consciousness or start breathing on their own again. They have already died."
The brain stem,"The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).
The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body's automatic functions that are essential for life.
These include:
breathing
heartbeat
blood pressure
swallowing
The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain's core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement.
After brain death, it is not possible for someone to remain conscious."
Causes of brain death,"Brain death can happen when the blood or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped.
This can be caused by:
cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen
a heart attack – when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked
a stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted
a blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body
Brain death can also be caused by:
a severe head injury
a brain haemorrhage
infections, such as encephalitis
a brain tumour"
Brain death is different from a vegetative state,"The difference between brain death and a vegetative state (a disorder of consciousness), which can happen after extensive brain damage, is that it's possible to recover from a vegetative state, but brain death is permanent.
Someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means:
some form of consciousness may exist
breathing unaided is usually possible
there's a slim chance of recovery because the brain stem's core functions may be unaffected
Someone in a vegetative state is awake but shows no signs of awareness. For example, they may open their eyes but not respond to their surroundings.
In rare cases, a person in a vegetative state may show some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings."
Tests to confirm brain death,"Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead.
These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia.
A number of tests are carried out to check for brain death, such as shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light.
Find out more about diagnosing brain death"
Organ donation,"After brain death, it may be possible for the person's organs to be used in transplants, which can often save the lives of others.
In cases where a deceased person has not made their wishes clear, deciding whether to donate their organs can be a difficult decision for partners and relatives.
Hospital staff are aware of these difficulties and will try to ensure the issue is handled sensitively and thoughtfully.
Find out more about organ donation on NHS Blood and Transplant"
Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage,"There are usually no warning signs, but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining, such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex.
The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include:
a sudden severe headache unlike anything you’ve experienced before
a stiff neck
feeling and being sick
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
blurred or double vision
stroke-like symptoms – such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body
loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking)
A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone in your care has these symptoms."
How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated,"A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a CT scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain.
If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit.
Medicine will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications, and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out.

Causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages,"Subarachnoid haemorrhages are often caused by a burst blood vessel in the brain (a ruptured brain aneurysm).
It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people.
But certain risk factors have been identified, including:
smoking
high blood pressure
excessive alcohol consumption
Severe head injuries can cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages."
Who's affected?,"Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age, but are most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men.
Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure."
Reducing your risk,"There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are:
stop smoking – your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice, or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044
moderate your alcohol units (alcohol consumption)
take steps to prevent high blood pressure – such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight"
Possible complications,"A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications.
Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain.
Long-term complications include:
epilepsy – where a person has repeated seizures (fits)
problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration
changes in mood, such as depression
Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage."
Outlook,"Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, it can be fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems.
Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as:
extreme tiredness
headaches
problems sleeping
Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage."
Symptoms,"The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on where it is in the brain.
Common symptoms include:
headaches (often worse in the morning and when coughing or straining)
fits (seizures)
regularly feeling sick (vomiting)
memory problems or changes in personality
weakness, vision problems or speech problems that get worse
See a GP if you have symptoms of a brain tumour that don't go away. It's unlikely to be a tumour, but it's best to be sure."
Types,"There are lots of types of brain tumour. They have different names depending on where they are in the brain.
They're also given a number from 1 to 4, known as the grade.
The higher the number, the more serious a tumour is:
grade 1 and 2 brain tumours are non-cancerous (benign) tumours that tend to grow quite slowly
grade 3 and 4 brain tumours are cancerous (malignant) tumours that grow more quickly and are more difficult to treat
Brain tumours are also called primary (which start in the brain) and secondary (which spread to the brain).
Cancer Research UK has more on types of brain tumours."
Treatments,"Treatment for a brain tumour aims to remove as much of it as possible and try to stop it coming back.
The main treatments are:
surgery – a small section of skull is removed and the tumour is cut out before the piece of skull is fixed back in place
radiotherapy – radiation from an external machine is used to kill cancer cells after surgery
chemotherapy – medicine is used to kill cancer cells after surgery, or relieve symptoms if the tumour can't be removed
radiosurgery – lots of tiny beams of radiation are aimed at the cancer to kill it if you can't have surgery
carmustine implants (glial wafers) – a new way of giving chemotherapy for some high-grade tumours, where implants are inserted into the brain (read more about carmustine implant treatment on Cancer Research UK)
Medicines may also be used to relieve symptoms like headaches, seizures and being sick (vomiting)."
Outlook,"The outlook for a malignant brain tumour depends on things like where it is in the brain, its size, and what grade it is.
It can sometimes be cured if caught early on, but a brain tumour often comes back and sometimes it isn't possible to remove it.
Speak to your care team if you'd like to know what the outlook is for you, as it varies from person to person.
You can also find general survival statistics for brain tumours on the Cancer Research UK website."
Recovery and after effects,"After treatment, you might have some lasting problems, such as:
seizures
walking difficulties
speech problems
You may need treatment and support like occupational therapy and physiotherapy to help you recover or adapt to any problems.
It's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.
This means stopping smoking if you smoke, following a healthy diet and doing regular exercise.
You may be able to gradually return to your normal activities as you recover, although some things (like contact sports) may need to be avoided for life.
Side effects of treatment
Some people who have had a brain tumour can develop side effects from treatment months or years later, such as:
cataracts
epilepsy
problems with thinking, memory, language or judgement
Rarely, a stroke might happen.
If you or someone you care for has any worrying symptoms that develop after brain tumour treatment, see your doctor.
If you think it's a stroke, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance."

Grades and types of brain tumour,"Brain tumours are graded according to how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.
Grade 1 and 2 tumours are low grade, and grade 3 and 4 tumours are high grade.
There are 2 main types of brain tumours:
non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours – these are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment
cancerous (malignant) brain tumours – these are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatment
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about specific types of brain tumours."
Symptoms of a brain tumour,"The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain affected.
Common symptoms include:
headaches
seizures (fits)
persistently feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and drowsiness
mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality
progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body
vision or speech problems
Sometimes you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may develop very slowly over time."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have these types of symptoms, particularly if you have a headache that feels different from the type of headache you usually get, or if headaches are getting worse.
You may not have a brain tumour, but these types of symptoms should be checked.
If the GP cannot identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a doctor who specialises in the brain and nervous system (neurologist) for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan."
Who's affected,"Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.
More than 12,000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour in the UK each year, of which about half are cancerous. Many others are diagnosed with a secondary brain tumour."
Causes and risks,"The cause of most brain tumours is unknown, but there are several risk factors that may increase your chances of developing a brain tumour.
Risk factors include:
age – the risk of getting a brain tumour increases with age (most brain tumours happen in older adults aged 85 to 89), although some types of brain tumour are more common in children
radiation – exposure to radiation accounts for a very small number of brain tumours; some types of brain tumours are more common in people who have had radiotherapy, or very rarely, CT scans or X-rays of the head
family history and genetic conditions – some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of getting a brain tumour, including tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and Turner syndrome"
Treating brain tumours,"If you have a brain tumour, your treatment will depend on:
the type of tumour
where it is in your brain
how big it is and how far it's spread
how abnormal the cells are
your overall health and fitness
Treatments for brain tumours include:
steroids
medicines to help with symptoms
surgery
radiotherapy
chemotherapy
After being diagnosed with a brain tumour, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumour.
Other medicines can be used to help with other symptoms of brain tumours, such as anti-epileptic medicines for seizures and painkillers for headaches.
Surgery is often used to remove brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much abnormal tissue as safely as possible.
It's not always possible to remove all of a tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed to treat any abnormal cells left behind.
Treatment for non-cancerous tumours is often successful and a full recovery is possible.
Sometimes there's a small chance the tumour could return, so you may need regular follow-up appointments to monitor this."
Outlook,"If you have a brain tumour, your outlook will depend on several factors, including:
your age
the type of tumour you have
where it is in your brain
how effective the treatment is
your general health
Survival rates are difficult to predict because brain tumours are uncommon and there are many different types.
Your doctor will be able to give you more information about your outlook.
Generally, around 17 out of every 100 people with a cancerous brain tumour will survive for 5 years or more after being diagnosed.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about survival rates for different types of brain tumour."
Check if you have a breast abscess,"Symptoms of a breast abscess may include:
a lump or swelling in your breast
pain in your breast, it may also feel warm or look red (this may be harder to see on brown or black skin)
a high temperature
feeling generally unwell
You’re more likely to have a breast abscess if you have recently had a breast infection (mastitis) or if you’ve had a breast abscess before."
What happens at your GP appointment for a breast abscess,"If the GP thinks you have a breast abscess, they will refer you to hospital for an ultrasound scan of your breast to check for an abscess."
Treatment for a breast abscess,"You’ll need to go to hospital to have treatment for a breast abscess.
Treatment involves the pus being drained from the abscess with either:
a needle – this might need to be done a few times and you may have to go back to hospital each time
a small cut in your skin
You'll be given a local anaesthetic before the pus is drained so you do not feel any pain. You can usually go home the same day and may be given antibiotics to take at home.
The abscess should heal completely in a few days or weeks.
Breastfeeding during treatment"
Causes of a breast abscess,"A breast abscess can form if you have a breast infection (called mastitis) and it's not treated quickly.
You're more likely to get mastitis if you are breastfeeding. You can get it if you're not breastfeeding, but this is less common.
Getting treatment for mastitis as soon as possible can help reduce the risk of getting an abscess."
Symptoms of breast cancer in men,"The symptoms of breast cancer in men include:
a lump in the breast – this is usually hard, painless and does not move around within the breast
the nipple turning inwards
fluid oozing from the nipple (nipple discharge), which may be streaked with blood
a sore or rash around the nipple that does not go away
the nipple or surrounding skin becoming hard, red or swollen
small bumps in the armpit (swollen glands)
Read more about the symptoms of breast cancer in men."
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you have:
a lump in your breast
any other worrying symptoms, such as nipple discharge
a history of breast cancer (in men or women) in members of your family and you're worried about your chances of getting it
It's very unlikely you have cancer, but it's best to get your symptoms checked. Your GP will examine your breast and can refer you for tests and scans for breast cancer if needed.
If you do not have symptoms but have a clear family history of breast cancer, your GP may refer you to a genetic specialist to discuss your risk of getting it.
There are some inherited genes that increase your risk of cancer and a blood test can be done to check for these. Read about testing for cancer risk genes."
Treatments for breast cancer in men,"The treatment for breast cancer in men depends on how far the cancer has spread.
Possible treatments include:
surgery to remove the affected breast tissue and nipple (mastectomy) and some of the glands in your armpit
radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy – where cancer medicine is used to kill cancer cells
other medicines that help stop breast cancer growing – including tamoxifen and trastuzumab (Herceptin)
Many men have surgery followed by 1 or more of the other treatments. This can help stop the cancer coming back in the future.
Read more about treatments for breast cancer in men."
Outlook for breast cancer in men,"The outlook for breast cancer in men varies depending on how far it has spread by the time it's diagnosed.
It may be possible to cure breast cancer if it's found early.
A cure is much less likely if the cancer is found after it has spread beyond the breast. In these cases, treatment can relieve your symptoms and help you live longer.
Speak to your breast care nurse if you'd like to know more about the outlook for your cancer."
Causes of breast cancer in men,"The exact cause of breast cancer in men is not known, but there are some things that increase your risk of getting it.
These include:
genes and family history – inheriting faulty versions of genes called BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases your risk of breast cancer
conditions that can increase the level of oestrogen in the body – including obesity, Klinefelter syndrome and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)
previous radiotherapy to the chest area
It's not certain that you can do anything to reduce your risk, but eating a balanced diet, losing weight if you're overweight and not drinking too much alcohol may help."

What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have a breast lump, a GP will look at and examine your breasts.
If they're not sure what's causing the lump, they'll refer you to a hospital or breast clinic for further tests.
These tests usually show that a lump is not cancer.
What happens at the breast clinic
At the hospital or breast clinic, you may have a:
breast examination
scan – usually a breast X-ray (mammogram) or ultrasound
biopsy – where a needle is inserted into the lump to remove some cells for testing
These tests are often done during the same visit. You'll usually be told the results on the same day, although biopsy results take longer – you may have to wait about a week.
Treatment for a breast lump depends on the cause. Most are harmless and may go away on their own without treatment."
Causes of breast lumps,"Lumps in the breasts can have lots of different causes.
They're often caused by something harmless like a non-cancerous tissue growth (fibroadenoma) or a build-up of fluid (breast cyst).
Sometimes, a breast lump can be a sign of something serious like breast cancer.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your lump – always see a GP."
Causes of breast pain,"Breast pain is usually linked to periods. Sometimes it can be caused by a health condition or medicine.
Breast pain linked to periods
Breast pain linked to periods usually:
begins up to 2 weeks before a period, gets worse and then goes away when the period ends
feels dull, heavy or aching
affects both breasts and sometimes spreads to the armpit
Other causes of breast pain
Other causes of breast pain include:
injuries or sprains to the neck, shoulder or back – these can be felt as breast pain
medicines like the contraceptive pill and some antidepressants
conditions like mastitis or a breast abscess
pregnancy
hormone changes during the menopause
Breast pain by itself is unlikely to be a symptom of cancer."
Things you can do to ease breast pain,"To help ease breast pain:
take paracetamol or ibuprofen, or rub painkilling gel on your breasts
wear a properly fitted bra during the day and a soft bra to sleep in
There's little evidence that vitamin E tablets or evening primrose oil help with breast pain."
Eligibility criteria for NHS breast reduction,"The availability of breast reduction surgery on the NHS varies, depending on the eligibility criteria decided by your local integrated care board (ICB).
Some ICBs do not fund breast reduction surgery at all, and others fund it selectively if you fulfil certain criteria.
Generally speaking, you might be considered for breast reduction on the NHS if you have problems caused by having very large breasts, such as:
backache
shoulder or neck pain
skin irritation
rashes and skin infections under the breasts
grooves on the shoulders from bra straps
psychological distress, such as low self-esteem or depression
an inability to exercise or take part in sports
ICBs also tend to have additional criteria that may include the size of your breasts, your weight, your age, whether you smoke, and whether other options (such as wearing professionally fitted bras) have been tried, but have not helped.
You can find out what the eligibility criteria are in your area from a GP or by contacting your local ICB."
The referral process,"See a GP if you think you might be eligible for breast reduction surgery on the NHS.
They can check whether you meet the criteria of your local ICB and, if you do, they can refer you to a breast or plastic surgeon for an assessment.
This may involve:
asking about the problems you're having
checking your weight and general health
an assessment by a psychiatrist or psychologist
information about the risks and results of surgery
The assessment will help determine whether you're suitable for surgery and whether there's a strong enough reason for this to be done on the NHS.
The final decision is usually made by a panel of representatives from your local ICB, which will take into account the information from your assessments and a review of your individual case."
Things to consider before you go ahead,"It's important to discuss your problems and options with a GP and an appropriately qualified surgeon before having a breast reduction.
This will help you get a clear idea of what changes you can expect to see and ensure you're aware of any risks involved.
Be aware that:
a significant reduction can alter the shape and look of your breasts
there will be scarring and possibly lost or altered nipple sensation
your breasts can change in size and shape after surgery – for example, they may increase or decrease in size if you put on or lose weight
breasts have a tendency to droop over time
your breasts can get bigger during pregnancy and you may not be able to breastfeed after surgery – so you may need to wait until you're sure you do not want to have any more children
For women with very large breasts, the benefits of a reduction may outweigh any potential problems.
But for women with only moderately large breasts, the benefits may not be worth the risks."
Alternatives to breast reduction surgery,"It's sometimes possible to reduce problems caused by having large breasts without the need for surgery.
The following measures may help:
if you're overweight, losing weight can sometimes help reduce the amount of fatty tissue in your breasts
a professional bra-fitting service – for many women with problems caused by large breasts, getting a professional to fit a correctly sized bra can reduce discomfort
physiotherapy – exercises from a physiotherapist can sometimes help with aches and pains caused by large breasts
psychological support and treatment – this can help if your large breasts are causing emotional or mental health issues
Breast reduction surgery will usually only be available on the NHS if you have first tried alternative measures."
Male breast reduction on the NHS,"Male breast reduction is not normally available on the NHS.
This is because enlarged breasts in men (gynaecomastia) are usually a result of being overweight, and losing weight will often help to reduce their size.
You'll normally need to pay privately for breast reduction surgery in these cases.
But breast reduction on the NHS may sometimes be considered if it's caused by an underlying condition, or if losing weight has not helped.
A GP can advise you about whether you might be suitable for surgery on the NHS."
More information,"For more about the operation and what to expect afterwards, see our topics on cosmetic breast reduction surgery and male breast reduction."
What happens during breath-holding,"During breath-holding, your child may:
cry and then be silent while holding their breath
open their mouth as if going to cry but make no sound
turn pale, blue or grey
be floppy or stiff, or their body may jerk
faint for 1 or 2 minutes
Your child may be sleepy or confused for a short while afterwards.
Breath-holding is usually harmless
Breath-holding can be scary for parents, but it's usually harmless and your child should grow out of it by the age of 4 or 5.
Breath-holding episodes:
usually last for less than 1 minute (if the child faints, they'll usually regain consciousness within 1 or 2 minutes)
are not epileptic seizures
Your child is not holding their breath on purpose and cannot control what happens when they have a breath-holding episode."
What to do when a child has a breath-holding episode,"There are some things you can do when a child has a breath-holding episode.
Do
stay calm – it should pass in less than 1 minute
lie the child on their side – do not pick them up
stay with them until the episode ends
make sure they cannot hit their head, arms or legs on anything
act normally after an episode, reassure them and ensure they get plenty of rest
Don’t
do not shake your child or splash them with water
do not put anything in their mouth (including your fingers)
do not give them mouth-to-mouth or CPR
do not tell them off (they're not doing it deliberately)"
Treatments for breath-holding,"There's no specific treatment for breath-holding. It should eventually stop by the time your child is 4 or 5 years old.
Medicines are rarely used to treat breath-holding.
Breath-holding is sometimes related to iron deficiency anaemia.
Your child's blood iron levels may be checked. They may need iron supplements if their iron levels are low."
Causes of breath-holding,"Breath-holding is not something a child does deliberately.
It's usually triggered by a sudden shock or pain, or strong emotions like fear, upset or anger.
There are 2 types of breath-holding:
blue breath-holding spells – this is the most common type of breath-holding and happens when a child's breathing pattern changes
reflex anoxic seizures – this type of breath-holding happens when a child's heart rate slows down"
While you're waiting to see a doctor,"If you think you've broken your ankle, there are some things you can do while you're waiting to see a doctor.
You should:
raise your ankle if possible
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your ankle for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
stop any bleeding – put pressure on the wound using a clean cloth or dressing
wrap your ankle loosely in a bandage to help support it (if your ankle is not at an odd angle)
remove any jewellery on your ankle or toes
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
not eat or drink anything in case you need surgery
not move or put weight on your ankle if possible"
Treatments for a broken ankle,"You'll usually have an X-ray to check if your ankle is broken and see how bad the break is.
If you have a very minor break, you may not need any treatment.
For a more serious break, you may need:
a special boot to help support your ankle
a plaster cast to hold your ankle in place while it heals
the bones to be moved back into place by a doctor (they'll give you an injection to numb your ankle)
surgery to fix the broken bones
You'll usually have follow-up appointments to check your ankle is healing properly."
Recovering from a broken ankle,"A broken ankle usually takes 6 to 8 weeks to heal, but it can take longer.
The doctor will tell you:
how long you'll have to wear the boot or have the plaster cast on
how much weight to put on your ankle – you may be given crutches or a walking frame to help keep weight off it
Once it's healed, use your ankle as normal. Moving it will stop it getting stiff.
You may need to see a physiotherapist. They can help you with exercises to get your foot and ankle gently moving again.
Ask your doctor when you can return to contact sports or other activities that put a lot of strain on your ankle.
Things you can do to help your recovery
It's important to follow any advice you're given by the hospital or fracture clinic.
There are some things you can do to ease pain and help your broken ankle recover.
Do
rest and raise your ankle whenever possible
take paracetamol or the painkiller your doctor has given you to ease pain
gently move your toes and bend your knee while wearing the boot or cast to ease stiff muscles
Don’t
do not get your plaster cast wet
do not carry heavy things
do not move your ankle too much
do not use anything to scratch under your cast
Urgent advice:
Get help from NHS 111 or go to an urgent treatment centre if:
You're recovering from a broken ankle and:
the pain in your ankle gets worse
your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery
your leg, foot or toes start to feel numb or like they're burning
your leg, foot or toes look swollen, or turn blue or white
the plaster cast or boot is rubbing, or feels too tight or too loose
there's a bad smell or discharge from under your cast
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."
Check if you have a broken arm or wrist,"You may have broken your arm or wrist if you've injured it and it suddenly became:
painful
swollen
bruised
difficult to move
It may also change colour, change shape or feel numb.
It can be hard to tell if a wrist is broken, dislocated or badly sprained. You'll probably need an X-ray."
Things to do while you're waiting to see a doctor,"If you think you've broken your arm or wrist, there are things you can do while you wait to see a doctor.
Do
use a towel as a sling to support the affected arm
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to the injured area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
stop any bleeding by applying pressure to the wound with a clean pad or dressing if possible
remove any jewellery such as rings or watches – your fingers, wrist or hand could swell up
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
Don’t
do not eat or drink anything in case you need surgery to fix the bone when you get to hospital
do not try to use the affected arm or wrist"
Treatment for a broken arm or wrist,"When you get to hospital the affected arm will be placed in a splint to support it and stop any broken bones from moving out of position. You will also be given painkilling medicines for the pain.
An X-ray is then used to see if there is a break and how bad that break is.
A plaster cast can be used to keep your arm in place until it heals. Sometimes this may be done a few days later to allow any swelling to go down first.
You may be given a sling to support your arm.
A doctor may try to fit the broken bones back into place with their hands before applying a splint or cast. You'll be given medicine before this happens so you will not feel any pain.
If you had a very bad break, surgery may be carried out to fix broken bones back into place.
Before leaving hospital, you'll be given painkillers to take home and advice on how to look after your cast.
You'll be asked to attend follow-up appointments to check how your arm or wrist is healing."
Recovering from a broken arm or wrist,"It usually takes around 6 to 8 weeks to recover from a broken arm or wrist. It can take longer if your arm or wrist was severely damaged.
You'll need to wear your plaster cast until the broken bone heals. The skin under the cast may be itchy for a few days but this should pass.
The hospital will give you an advice sheet on exercises you should do every day to help speed up your recovery.
Your arm or wrist may be stiff and weak after the cast is removed. A physiotherapist can help with these problems, although sometimes they can last several months or more.
Things you can do to help during recovery
Do
try to keep your hand raised above your elbow whenever possible (use a pillow at night to do this)
follow any exercise advice you have been given
use the painkillers you have been given to ease pain
Don’t
do not get your cast wet – waterproof cast covers are available from pharmacies
do not use anything to scratch under the cast as this could lead to an infection
do not drive or try to lift heavy items until you have been told it's safe to do so
Urgent advice:
Get help from NHS 111 if:
the pain in your arm or wrist gets worse
your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery
your cast breaks, or the cast feels too tight or too loose
your fingers, wrist and arm start to feel numb
your fingers, wrist and arm look swollen or turn blue or white
there's a bad smell or discharge of liquid from under your cast
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."
Check if you have a broken collarbone,"You may have broken your collarbone if you've been injured and your shoulder:
is very painful
is swollen or bruised
has changed shape
has bone sticking out of the skin
Sometimes a broken collarbone can lead to complications that cause other symptoms such as:
chest pain
difficulty breathing
coughing up blood
But this is rare."
While you're waiting to see a doctor,"If you think you've broken your collarbone, there are some things you can do while you're waiting to see a doctor.
You should:
use a towel or bandage to put the affected arm in a sling
stop any bleeding by putting pressure on the wound with a clean towel or dressing, if possible
avoid using the affected shoulder or arm
avoid touching the bone if it's sticking out from your skin"
Treatment for a broken collarbone,"You'll need to have X-rays to check if you've broken your collarbone. A broken collarbone needs to be treated in hospital.
Your arm will usually be put in a sling to help your collarbone heal. You'll also be given painkillers to help with pain.
If the break is very bad you may need surgery to repair it, but this is rare.
You'll usually be shown some shoulder and arm exercises to do at home to help you recover quicker.
After you've left the hospital, you'll need to go for follow-up appointments to check how your collarbone is healing."
Recovering from a broken collarbone,"Most people recover from a broken collarbone in 6 to 8 weeks. Children often recover quicker, usually in 3 to 4 weeks.
You may need to wear a sling for 2 to 3 weeks. You'll then need to rest your shoulder for a few more weeks and keep doing the exercises you've been given, until it's fully recovered
There are some things you can do to help your recovery.
Do
take painkillers to help with the pain
regularly do the shoulder and arm exercises you've been given
try to do your usual daily activities as much as possible, without using your shoulder
get advice from your doctor about when you can go back to more physical activities, such as playing sports
Don’t
do not do any lifting or play sport while you're recovering"
Check if you've broken a finger or thumb,"If you’ve broken a finger or thumb it's likely to be:
painful
swollen
bruised
difficult to move
It may also change colour or feel numb.
It can be hard to tell if a finger is broken, dislocated or badly sprained. You'll probably need an X-ray."
While you're waiting to see a doctor,"If you think you’ve broken your finger or thumb, there are some things you can do while you’re waiting to see a doctor.
You should:
try not to move the finger or thumb – it may help to tape it to the finger next to it
lift your hand up to reduce swelling
apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours to reduce swelling
if there's a cut, cover it with a clean dressing
take paracetamol to help ease the pain – when you see the doctor they may suggest different or stronger painkillers if you need them
remove any rings from the affected hand"
Treatments for a broken finger or thumb,"A doctor or nurse might:
try to straighten your finger – they'll give you an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the pain
put your finger in a splint or cast, or strap it to another finger to keep it in position
give you a tetanus injection or antibiotics if there's a cut, to prevent infection
You may need surgery for complicated breaks – for example, if it's broken in lots of places or the nerves are damaged.
You may be invited back for a follow-up appointment to check how your finger or thumb is healing."
Recovering from a broken finger or thumb,"A broken finger or thumb usually heals within 6 to 8 weeks, but it can take longer.
It may be 3 to 4 months before full strength returns to your hand.
Once it's healed, use your finger or thumb as normal. Moving it will stop it getting stiff.
Your doctor may be able to give you some gentle hand exercises.
Ask your doctor when you can return to contact sports or other activities that put a lot of strain on your fingers.
Things you can do to help your recovery
There are some things you can do to ease pain and speed up healing of a broken finger or thumb.
Do
take paracetamol to relieve pain – your doctor may recommend different or stronger painkillers if needed
keep your hand up to reduce swelling – rest it on a cushion or a pillow
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel on the finger or thumb for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
Don’t
try not to use the affected hand so it can heal properly
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
you're worried the break is not healing properly
the pain and swelling have not started to ease after a few days
it hurts to use the finger or thumb once the cast or strapping is off"
Check if you have a broken hip,"A broken hip usually happens because of a fall or injury. It's more common in older people and people who have osteoporosis.
Symptoms of a broken hip include:
pain in the hip or upper leg
swelling and bruising around your hip and upper leg
not being able to stand or put weight on the affected hip and leg
difficulty moving your hip and leg
the affected leg is at an odd angle or is shorter than the unaffected leg"
Treatment for a broken hip,"A broken hip needs to be treated in hospital straight away.
You'll usually be given painkillers and have an X-ray to check if your hip is broken and to decide what treatment is best for you.
Most people will need surgery to treat a broken hip.
Depending on things like your age and the type of break, you may have surgery to:
fix the broken bones back into place using screws, nails, rods or plates
replace some of the damaged hip joint with an artificial part (hemiarthroplasty)
replace all of the damaged hip joint with an artificial joint (hip replacement)
You'll usually have surgery on the same day or day after you arrive in hospital."
Recovering from a broken hip,"A broken hip usually takes several weeks or months to heal, but it can take longer.
You'll usually spend around 1 to 4 weeks in hospital.
Soon after surgery you will start having regular physiotherapy to help you start standing and moving again.
When you leave hospital, you'll be given exercises to continue doing at home.
You may never get back the same strength and movement as you had before your break, and you may need to use a walking stick or frame.
Some people need help from carers or other health professionals when they move back home.
Information:
It's important to do the exercises recommended by your physiotherapist regularly. This will help you recover and improve your strength and movement."
What to do,"If you think you or someone else has broken their leg, go immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.
Call 999 for an ambulance if the injury seems severe or you're not able to get to A&E quickly.
While you make your way to A&E or wait for an ambulance:
avoid moving the injured leg as much as possible – keep it straight and put a cushion or clothing underneath to support it
do not try to realign any bones that are out of place
cover any open wounds with a sterile dressing, a clean cloth or a clean item of clothing – maintain direct pressure on the wound if it is bleeding
If the person is pale, cold and sweaty (in shock), lie them down and keep them warm and calm until you can get medical help."
How a broken leg is treated,"Immobilisation
First, a healthcare professional will give you painkillers and may fix a splint to your leg to secure it in position and prevent further damage.
For severe pain, you may be given painkilling gas through a face mask or medicine through a drip into a vein.
An X-ray will be done to assess the fracture.
If the broken bone is still in position, you'll usually just need a plaster cast. This holds the bone in place so it can heal.
If there's a lot of swelling, you may just have a splint or cast around the back half of your leg until the swelling goes down. A full cast can be fitted a few days later.
You may be provided with painkillers to take home and information on how to look after your cast.
Read more about how to care for your plaster cast.
Reduction
If the bones are misaligned, a doctor or surgeon may need to put them back into place. This is known as reduction.
Sedatives are sometimes provided before the procedure and local or regional anaesthetic is used to numb the site of the break.
In some cases a general anaesthetic is needed, which means you'll be asleep during the procedure.
Once the bones are in the correct position, a plaster cast can be applied.
Surgery
Severe fractures are often treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. Surgeons can fix bones with metal wires, plates, screws or rods.
Plates, screws and rods will usually be left in place permanently unless they become a problem, whereas wires will be removed 4 to 6 weeks after the operation.
Sometimes an external frame (external fixator) is attached to the broken bones with metal pins to help keep them in place. This is removed once the fracture has healed.
After surgery, a plaster cast may be applied to protect the leg."
Follow-up appointments,"An appointment will be made for you to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can monitor your fracture.
The first appointment is usually booked for a week or 2 after you're discharged from hospital.
Severe fractures will usually heal within 3 to 6 months, but may require follow-up appointments every few months for a year or more afterwards.
Further X-rays are often necessary to check how well your leg is healing."
Recovering from a broken leg,"You'll be given advice by your doctor about how much you should move your leg and when you can put weight on it.
It takes around 6 to 8 weeks for a minor fracture to heal. You'll probably need to use crutches or a wheelchair during this time, until it's possible to put weight on the leg again.
You'll be shown how to safely use any mobility equipment you're provided with.
More severe fractures can take between 3 and 6 months to fully heal. Some can take even longer.
The hospital may recommend regular physiotherapy appointments to help you maintain or regain muscle strength, movement and flexibility.
This will include specific exercises to do before and after the cast is removed.
Do not try to rush your recovery by returning to your normal activities too quickly, as the broken bone may not be fully healed even when the pain has gone.
Follow the advice of your doctor, who'll probably recommend gradually increasing how much you use your leg over time.
You should not drive while in a cast. Seek advice from your doctor about when you can drive again."
Possible complications,"For most people, a broken bone will heal within a few months and there will not be any further problems.
But complications can sometimes occur.
Damaged muscle, nerves or blood vessels
Damage around the fracture can occur during the initial injury or during surgery. 
It may lead to loss of movement or feeling, or may affect the blood supply to the limb.
Bone infection
This is more likely if surgery is performed or the broken bone stuck out of the skin. 
It can significantly delay healing and will often require treatment with antibiotics, surgery, or both.
Compartment syndrome
Compartment syndrome is a painful and potentially serious condition caused by bleeding or swelling within a bundle of muscles.
This can occur soon after a fracture, after the plaster cast has been applied, or after surgery.
Emergency surgery will usually be needed to relieve the build-up of pressure in your leg.
Other complications
Occasionally, a further operation may be needed if the bone does not heal properly.
This can happen if the bone doesn't align properly during surgery, you put too much weight on the bone before it heals, the fracture is severe, you have diabetes, or you smoke during your recovery."
Types of fracture,"Some broken bones are more serious than others – it depends on the location of the fracture, how the bone has broken, and whether there's any damage to the surrounding tissue.
The most common types of fracture are:
stress fractures – tiny cracks in the bone caused by overuse, common in athletes
undisplaced or hairline fracture – a fracture through the bone with little damage to the surrounding tissue
displaced fracture – the 2 parts of the broken bone have moved apart (misaligned)
comminuted fracture – the bone has broken (shattered) into several pieces
open or compound fracture – a complicated break where the bone has broken through the skin, or the initial injury has exposed the broken bone"
Check if it's a broken nose,"Symptoms of a broken nose include:
pain, swelling and bruising
a crunching or crackling sound when you touch your nose
difficulty breathing through your nose – it might feel blocked
your nose changing shape – for example, it's not as straight as before
A broken nose may cause bruising under your eyes (black eyes).
Credit:
You may also have a cut on the bridge of your nose, or a nosebleed.
Credit:"
How to treat a broken nose yourself,"You can usually treat a broken nose yourself. It should start getting better within 3 days and be fully healed within 3 weeks.
Do
hold an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel on your nose for up to 15 minutes, several times a day
take paracetamol to relieve pain
treat nosebleeds by sitting or standing upright and leaning forward – if possible, pinch your nose above the nostrils for up to 15 minutes
keep your head upright when lying in bed by adding more pillows – this will help to reduce swelling
treat minor cuts and grazes by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound and covering it with a plaster or dressing
Don’t
do not try to straighten your nose yourself if it's changed shape – get help from 111 online, go to a minor injuries unit or see a GP
do not wear glasses until the swelling has gone down, unless you need them
do not pick or blow your nose until it's healed
do not do strenuous exercise for the first 2 weeks
do not play sports for at least 6 weeks if there's a chance your face might be hit"
Treatment for a broken nose,"A GP might prescribe stronger painkillers if paracetamol is not helping with pain caused by a broken nose.
If you have a severe broken nose or it's changed shape, you may be referred to a specialist in hospital for assessment and treatment.
If your nose has changed shape
A doctor in hospital may be able to make your nose straighter using a procedure called manipulation.
You might have to go home and wait for the swelling to go down first, but the procedure should be done within 3 weeks of you breaking your nose, before the bones start to set.
Manipulation is done using local anaesthetic so that your nose is numbed. It does not always make your nose look exactly the same as it was before, but it often helps.
If you have a large wound
The wound will usually be cleaned and sealed with stitches or strips in hospital."
Check if you have a bruised or broken rib,"Broken or bruised ribs are usually caused by a fall, a blow to the chest or severe coughing.
Symptoms include:
strong pain in your chest area, particularly when you breathe in or cough
swelling or tenderness around the affected ribs
sometimes bruising on the skin
feeling or hearing a crack if it's a broken rib
Ribs cannot be easily splinted or supported like other bones, so they're usually left to heal naturally.
There's often no need for an X-ray."
How to treat broken or bruised ribs yourself,"Broken or bruised ribs usually get better by themselves within 2 to 6 weeks.
There are things you can do to help ease pain and speed up healing.
Do
use painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to the affected ribs regularly in the first few days to bring down swelling
rest and take time off work if you need to
breathe normally and cough when you need to – this helps clear mucus from your lungs to prevent chest infections
hold a pillow against your chest if you need to cough
walk around and sometimes move your shoulders to help you breathe and clear mucus from your lungs
regularly take slow, deep breaths to help clear your lungs
try to sleep more upright for the first few nights
Don’t
do not lie down or stay still for a long time
do not strain yourself or lift heavy objects
do not play any sports or do any exercise that makes your pain worse
do not smoke"
Check if you have a broken toe,"You may have broken your toe if it's:
red or bruised
painful and swollen
difficult to walk on
Information:
Do not worry if you're not sure if it's broken or just bruised, treatment is usually the same for both."
What you can do about a broken toe,"Doctors will usually suggest you treat a broken toe at home first if:
it's not your big toe
the bone is not sticking out of your foot
your toe is not pointing at an odd angle
there's no wound on your toe
Broken toes usually heal within 4 to 6 weeks, but it can sometimes take several months.
Do
take ibuprofen or paracetamol for the pain and swelling
rest your foot and keep it raised
hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your toe for up to 20 minutes every few hours
wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel
avoid walking around as much as possible
strap up your broken toe – put a small piece of cotton wool or gauze between your sore toe and the toe next to it, then tape them together to support the sore toe
Don’t
do not strap up your toe if it's pointing out at an odd angle or you have hurt your big toe – get medical advice
do not put ice directly on your skin
do not walk or stand for long periods
do not wear tight, pointy shoes
do not play any sports like football, rugby or hockey for 6 weeks or until the pain eases
do not try to treat your child's toe – take them to an urgent treatment centre or A&E
A pharmacist can help with a broken toe
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
what you need to strap up your toe
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
When to see a GP,"You should see a GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be caused by bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.
If the GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they'll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests.
Read more about diagnosing bronchiectasis."
How the lungs are affected,"The lungs are full of tiny branching airways known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs.
In bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection.
If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them and the risk of infection increases.
Over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs."
Why it happens,"Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed. 
There are many reasons why this may happen. The 3 most common causes in the UK are:
having had a lung infection in the past, such as pneumonia or whooping cough, that damages the bronchi
underlying problems with the immune system (the body's defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection
aspergillosis – an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi are inhaled
But in many cases, no obvious cause for the condition can be found. This is known as idiopathic bronchiectasis.
Read more about the causes of bronchiectasis."
Who is affected,"Bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It's estimated around 1 in every 100 adults in the UK have the condition.
It can affect anyone at any age, but symptoms do not usually develop until middle age."
How bronchiectasis is treated,"The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.
The main treatments include:
exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs
medicine to help improve airflow within the lungs
antibiotics to treat any lung infections that develop
Surgery is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments have not been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area, and you're in good general health.
Read more about the treatment of bronchiectasis."
Possible complications,"Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious.
One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting.
This can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it.
Read more about the complications of bronchiectasis."
Outlook,"The outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause.
Living with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy.
For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly.
Around 1,500 deaths reported in UK each year are thought to be caused by bronchiectasis."
Check if it's bronchiolitis,"The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks."
Treatments for bronchiolitis,"There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes"
Preventing bronchiolitis,"There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis."
Causes of bronchiolitis,"Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."
Check if you have bronchitis,"Symptoms of bronchitis can be similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms include:
a cough – you may cough up clear, white, yellow or green mucus
chest pain when coughing
shortness of breath
a sore throat
a runny nose
a high temperature"
Things you can do to help with bronchitis,"There are some things you can do to ease the symptoms of bronchitis and reduce the risk of spreading infections to other people.
Do
get plenty of rest – try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
drink plenty of fluids
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain and bring down a high temperature
try adding honey to a warm drink to help soothe your throat (do not give honey to babies under 1)
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze – put used tissues in the bin as quickly as possible
wash your hands regularly with water and soap
Don’t
do not smoke"
Treatments for bronchitis,"Bronchitis usually clears up without treatment in around 3 weeks. See a GP if your symptoms last longer than 3 weeks.
You may need antibiotics if your bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection."
Bronchodilators and corticosteroids,"Inhaled corticosteroids are the main treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent flare-ups in asthma.
But some people may also benefit from taking bronchodilators to keep the airways open and enhance the effects of corticosteroids.
Long-acting bronchodilators should never be taken without corticosteroids.
In COPD initial treatment is with short- or long-acting bronchodilators, with corticosteroids added in some severe cases.
Treatment with corticosteroids and bronchodilators may require the use of separate inhalers, but increasingly these medications are provided together in single inhalers."
Types of bronchodilator,"The 3 most widely used bronchodilators are:
beta-2 agonists, such as salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol and vilanterol
anticholinergics, such as ipratropium and tiotropium
theophylline
Beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics are available in both short-acting and long-acting forms, whereas theophylline is only available in a long-acting form.
Beta-2 agonists
Beta-2 agonists are used for both asthma and COPD, although some types are only available for COPD.
They're usually inhaled using a small handheld inhaler, but may also be available as tablets or syrup.
For sudden, severe symptoms, they can also be injected or nebulised.
A nebuliser is a compressor that turns liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing a large dose of the medicine to be inhaled through a mouthpiece or face mask.
Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating receptors called beta-2 receptors in the muscles that line the airways, which causes them to relax and allows the airways to widen (dilate).
They should be used with caution in people with:
an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) – a condition that occurs when there's too much thyroid hormone in the body
cardiovascular disease – conditions that affect the heart or blood vessels
an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
high blood pressure (hypertension)
diabetes – a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high
In rare cases, beta-2 agonists can make some of the symptoms and possible complications of these conditions worse.
Anticholinergics
Anticholinergics (also known as antimuscarinics) are mainly used to treat COPD, but a few can also be used for asthma.
They're usually taken using an inhaler, but may be nebulised to treat sudden and severe symptoms.
Anticholinergics cause the airways to widen by blocking the cholinergic nerves.
These nerves release chemicals that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten.
They should be used with caution in people with:
benign prostate enlargement – where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, which can affect how you pee
a bladder outflow obstruction – any condition that affects the flow of urine out of the bladder, such as bladder stones or prostate cancer
glaucoma – a build-up of pressure in the eye
If you have benign prostate enlargement or a bladder outflow obstruction, anticholinergics can cause problems, such as difficulty peeing and not being able to empty your bladder fully.
Glaucoma can get worse if anticholinergic medication unintentionally gets into the eyes.
Theophylline
Theophylline is usually taken in tablet or capsule form, but a different version called aminophylline can be given directly into a vein (intravenously) if your symptoms are severe.
It's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but it seems to reduce any inflammation (swelling) in the airways, in addition to relaxing the muscles lining them.
The effect of theophylline is weaker than other bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
It's also more likely to cause side effects, so is often only used alongside these medicines if they're not effective enough.
Theophylline should be used with caution in people with:
an overactive thyroid
cardiovascular disease
liver problems, such as liver disease
high blood pressure
open sores that develop on the stomach lining (stomach ulcers)
a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits (seizures) (epilepsy)
Theophylline may make these conditions worse. In people with liver problems, it can sometimes lead to a dangerous build-up of medication in the body.
Other medicines can also cause an abnormal build-up of theophylline in the body. This should always be checked by your doctor.
Older people may also need additional monitoring while taking theophylline."
Side effects,"The side effects of bronchodilators can vary, depending on the specific medication you're taking.
Make sure you read the leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the specific side effects are.
General side effects of bronchodilators include:
trembling, particularly in the hands
headaches
a dry mouth
suddenly noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)
muscle cramps
a cough
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
Find out more about the side effects of bronchodilators"
Pregnancy and breastfeeding,"In most cases bronchodilators should be taken as normal while pregnant or breastfeeding.
But speak to your GP if you regularly use bronchodilators and you're considering having a baby or think you might be pregnant.
Pregnancy may affect your asthma, so it's important to continue taking your medication and have it monitored regularly to make sure the condition is controlled.
Find out more about taking medication during pregnancy"
Interactions with other medicines,"Bronchodilators may interact with other medicines, which could affect the way they work or increase your risk of side effects.
Some of the medicines that can interact with bronchodilators (particularly theophylline) include:
some diuretics, a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body
some antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
digoxin, a medication used to treat arrhythmias
benzodiazepines, a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment for anxiety or sleeping problems (insomnia)
lithium, a medication used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder
quinolones, a type of antibiotic medication
This is not a complete list of all the medications that can interact with bronchodilators, and not all of these interactions apply to each type of bronchodilator.
Always carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. 
You may be able to find a specific leaflet on the medicines A to Z on the MHRA website. 
If in doubt, speak to a pharmacist or GP."
How you catch brucellosis,"Brucellosis is mainly caught by drinking milk or eating dairy products made from milk from infected animals that has not been pasteurised (heat-treated to kill bacteria).
In rare cases you can also catch brucellosis from:
eating contaminated raw or undercooked meat
contact with bodily fluids of infected farm animals such as cows, goats, sheep and pigs, or infected dogs
It's very rare to catch brucellosis from other people."
Symptoms of brucellosis,"Symptoms of brucellosis may appear suddenly over 1 to 2 days or gradually over several weeks.
The symptoms can be like flu and may include:
a high temperature
loss of appetite
sweating
headaches
extreme tiredness
back and joint pain"
How brucellosis is treated,"Brucellosis is usually diagnosed using a blood test.
The infection is treated with a course of antibiotics for at least 6 weeks. It's important to finish your course even if you start to feel better.
You should make a full recovery, although sometimes the infection can return (relapse)."
How to avoid getting brucellosis,"There's no vaccine against brucellosis for humans, but there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting it.
Do
avoid contact with livestock and wild animals while travelling in places where brucellosis is a problem
wear protective clothing if working with or handling animals, particularly if they're unwell
put a plaster on any wounds before touching animals
Don’t
do not drink unpasteurised milk
do not eat dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, made from unpasteurised milk
do not eat raw or undercooked meat"
Report suspected brucellosis,"Brucellosis is a notifiable disease. Doctors must report suspected cases in humans to the local council or local health protection team.
If you suspect it in animals, you must report it immediately. You can do this by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301.
Find out about notifiable diseases in animals on GOV.UK"
Symptoms of Brugada syndrome,"Brugada syndrome does not usually cause any symptoms. Sometimes it's found when you have an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.
If you do get symptoms they can include:
fainting or blackouts
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
heart palpitations
seizures or fits
shortness of breath
Symptoms usually start in adulthood, but it can happen at any age.
Brugada syndrome can also cause a dangerously fast or irregular heartbeat. This can lead to a cardiac arrest, where your heart beats so fast that not enough blood gets to your brain, so you become unconscious and stop breathing."
Tests for Brugada syndrome,"If a GP thinks you could have Brugada syndrome or another heart condition they'll refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist).
You'll have tests such as:
an electrocardiogram (ECG), where sensors are put on your chest to check your heart
a provocation test, where you're given a medicine while having an ECG
As Brugada syndrome is usually inherited, you may also be offered genetic testing to see if you have genes linked to the condition.
Important
If you're diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, your immediate family should also be offered testing as there's a chance they could also have the condition."
Treatments for Brugada syndrome,"If you have Brugada syndrome but you've not had any symptoms, you will not usually need any medical treatment. Most people with the condition have a low risk of serious problems.
You'll be monitored regularly to check the health of your heart.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
Doctors may recommend that you're fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
This is a small device that's put under your skin in your chest, in a similar way to a pacemaker. It monitors your heart rhythm and sends an electrical shock to your heart when it's needed to correct the rhythm.
You'll only need an ICD if either:
you've had symptoms such as a cardiac arrest, heart palpitations or fainting
doctors think you're at high risk of getting a dangerous heart rhythm based on your electrocardiogram (ECG) results"
How to reduce the risk of heart rhythm problems if you have Brugada syndrome,"If you have Brugada syndrome it's important to avoid triggers that can cause problems with your heart rhythm. Your care team will give you advice about this.
Do
check with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medicines – some medicines can cause problems in people with Brugada syndrome
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help prevent a high temperature if you're unwell
Don’t
do not drink too much alcohol – keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units a week, spread over 3 days or more
do not get dehydrated – you may need rehydration solutions if you're being sick or have diarrhoea
do not take part in very strenuous exercise or sports
Urgent advice:
Get help from NHS 111 if:
you have Brugada syndrome and you get a high temperature that does not go down after taking paracetamol or ibuprofen
You may be advised to go to A&E to be monitored.
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."
How you get Brugada syndrome,"Brugada syndrome is usually caused by the genes you inherit from your parents.
Less commonly, it can be caused by:
problems with the structure of your heart
taking certain medicines
using drugs such as cocaine
It's more common in men and in people of south east Asian origin."
Help and support for Brugada syndrome,"If you or someone in your family has Brugada syndrome you can get help and support from charities, including:
British Heart Foundation: support
Cardiac Risk in the Young: support"
Recording information about you and your condition,"If you have Brugada syndrome, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Causes of teeth grinding,"It's not always clear what causes people to grind their teeth.
It's often linked to:
stress and anxiety – this is the most common cause of teeth grinding
sleep problems like snoring and sleep apnoea
taking certain medicines, including a type of antidepressant known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
smoking, drinking lots of alcohol and caffeine, and taking drugs like ecstasy and cocaine
Teeth grinding is common in children and teenagers, particularly during sleep. It often stops when they reach adulthood and their adult teeth have come through."
How to reduce teeth grinding,"There are a number of things you can try that may help if you grind your teeth.
Do
find ways to relax – for example, by doing breathing exercises, listening to music and taking regular exercise
try to improve your sleep by going to bed at the same time every night, relaxing before bedtime and making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen if you have jaw pain or swelling
use an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel for 20 to 30 minutes to help reduce jaw pain or swelling
have regular dental check-ups
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol
do not take drugs like ecstasy or cocaine
do not chew gum or eat hard foods if you have tooth or jaw pain"
Symptoms of teeth grinding,"Teeth grinding can happen while you're awake or asleep.
As well as grinding your teeth and clenching your jaw, other symptoms can include:
face, neck and shoulder pain
a painful jaw, which can lead to a condition called temporomandibular disorder (TMD)
worn-down or broken teeth, which can cause increased sensitivity and loss of teeth and fillings
headaches
earache
disturbed sleep"
Treatments for teeth grinding,"Treatment for teeth grinding is not always needed.
Treatments from a dentist
A dentist may recommend a mouth guard or mouth splint.
These are worn at night and protect your teeth from damage. They can be made by a dentist to fit precisely over your upper or lower teeth
Treatments from a GP
A GP can give you advice and recommend treatments for reducing stress.
They will also be able to help if you want to give up smoking, or if you need advice about drug addiction or cutting down on alcohol."
Check if you have bulging eyes,"Credit:
You may have bulging eyes if:
your eyes seem to be sticking out more than usual
you can see less of your upper eye lids (your eyes might look like they’re open very wide)
you can see more of the whites of your eyes
Any other symptoms you have will depend on what's causing your eyes to stick out, but could include:
pain or problems closing your eyes or moving them around
dry eyes or feeling like there’s dirt or grit in them
your eyes hurt when looking at bright lights"
Causes of bulging eyes,"A common cause of bulging eyes is an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).
This is where the thyroid gland (a small gland in your neck), produces too much of the thyroid hormones.
Less common causes of bulging eyes include:
an infection or injury around or behind your eyes
bleeding behind the eyes or problems with blood vessels behind the eyes
tumours, including those caused by neuroblastoma and some soft tissue sarcomas"
Treatment for bulging eyes,"Treatment for bulging eyes depends on the cause.
You may need:
eye drops
medicine (if the bulging is caused by an infection, swelling, or a problem with your thyroid gland)
surgery to correct any bulging that does not go away after other treatments
If the cause is not clear, a GP may refer you to a specialist and you may need further tests."
Things you can do if you have bulging eyes,"If you have bulging eyes, there are things you can do to help ease your symptoms.
Do
use pillows to keep your head raised up when lying down
wear sunglasses if your eyes are sensitive in bright light
if you wear contact lenses, take them out and wear glasses to rest your eyes
Don’t
do not smoke or drink too much alcohol
do not spend too long in smoky, dry or dusty places
do not spend too long in air conditioned or heated rooms"
Check if you have bullous pemphigoid,Bullous pemphigoid mainly affects people over 60.
Treatment for bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid eventually goes away on its own, but it can last a few years.
Treatment can help your skin heal, stop new patches or blisters appearing, and reduce the chance of your skin getting infected.
The main treatments are:
steroid creams
steroid tablets
antibiotics
Your skin should eventually heal without scarring, but it might be a bit darker than it was before."
Causes of bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against infection). Instead of attacking germs, it attacks and damages the skin.
It's not known why this happens. Sometimes it's been linked to skin damage (such as sunburn) or taking certain medicines.
Bullous pemphigoid is not:
contagious – it cannot be spread to other people
caused by an allergy
affected by diet or lifestyle"
Check if you have bunions,"The main symptoms of bunions are hard lumps on the sides of your feet, by your big toes.
Credit:
Your big toe may point towards your other toes.
Credit:
You may have hard or swollen skin. The bunion may look red or darker than the skin around it.
Credit:
You may also have pain along the side or bottom of your feet. This is usually worse when wearing shoes and walking."
How to ease bunion pain yourself,"You cannot get rid of bunions or stop them getting worse yourself, but there are things you can do to ease any pain.
Do
wear wide shoes with a low heel and soft sole
hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to the bunion for up to 5 minutes at a time
try bunion pads (soft pads you put in shoes to stop them rubbing on a bunion) – you can buy these from pharmacies
take paracetamol or ibuprofen
try to lose weight if you're overweight
Don’t
do not wear high heels or tight, pointy shoes"
Treatments for bunions,"If you have bunions, a GP will look at your foot and ask you about your symptoms.
They might refer you to a foot specialist (podiatrist).
A GP or podiatrist can advise you about:
things you can do to ease your symptoms
things you can buy or have specially made to reduce bunion pain, such as insoles (orthotics), toe spacers and toe supports (splints)
You can also pay to see a foot specialist privately.
Find a podiatrist
Surgery
A GP may refer you for surgery if your bunions are very painful or they're having a big effect on your life.
Surgery is not done just to improve how your feet look."
How to prevent bunions,"The cause of bunions is not always known, but you may be more likely to get them if you wear shoes that do not fit properly.
It might help to:
make sure your shoes are the correct size and have enough room for your toes
avoid shoes with high heels or pointy toes"
Treating burns and scalds,"To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below:
immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning
remove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies, but do not move anything that's stuck to the skin
cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 to 30 minutes – do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter
make sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area
after cooling the burn, cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it – a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain
raise the affected area if possible – this helps to reduce swelling
if it's an acid or chemical burn, dial 999, carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible
Read more about treating burns and scalds."
When to get medical attention,"Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.
For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.
More serious burns require professional medical attention.
You should go to a hospital A&E department for:
all chemical and electrical burns
large or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's hand
burns that cause white or charred skin – any size
burns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals
If someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention.
Some symptoms may be delayed and can include:
coughing
a sore throat
difficulty breathing
facial burns
People at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald.
The size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended.
Read more about:
recovering from burns and scalds
complications of burns and scalds"
Types of burn,"Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected.
Your skin has 3 layers:
the epidermis – the outer layer of skin
the dermis – the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles
the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis – the deeper layer of fat and tissue
There are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:
superficial epidermal burn – where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered
superficial dermal burn – where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters
deep dermal or partial thickness burn – where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless
full thickness burn – where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. It may also be painless"
Preventing burns and scalds,"Many severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children.
Examples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include:
keeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible
testing the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath
keeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach
keeping hot drinks well away from young children
Read more about preventing burns and scalds."
Further advice,"If you need advice about a burn or scald, you can:
get help from NHS 111
go to a minor injuries unit
go to an NHS walk-in centre
call or see a GP"
Check if you have bursitis,"You might have bursitis if 1 of your joints is:
painful – usually a dull, achy pain
tender or warmer than surrounding skin
swollen
more painful when you move it or press on it
The area may also be red. This can be harder to see on brown or black skin.
Bursitis can affect any joint, but it's most common in the shoulders, hips, elbows or knees."
How to treat bursitis yourself,"If you have bursitis, to help bring down swelling and pain you can:
rest – try not to move the joint too much and avoid activities that put pressure on it
use ice – gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel on the area for around 10 minutes at a time and repeat every few hours during the day
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to ease any pain
It may also help to put extra cushions around the affected joint while you sleep, to help protect and support it."
Tests for bursitis,"A GP will examine the affected joint to check for bursitis.
They may take a sample of fluid from the joint using a needle (aspiration).
This will be sent off to test for an infection and conditions such as gout.
The aspiration may also help your symptoms. It might be done in your GP surgery or you may be referred to the hospital.
You may also have other tests such as a blood test or a scan."
Treatments for bursitis,"Treatments you may have for bursitis include:
antibiotics – usually taken for at least 7 days if bursitis is caused by an infection
a steroid injection given into the affected joint to reduce the swelling – this will not be done if bursitis is caused by an infection
taking fluid from the joint using a needle (aspiration) to ease symptoms
If bursitis is severe or keeps coming back, the inflamed bursa may need to be surgically drained or even removed (but this is rare).
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have bursitis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for bursitis near you"
How to stop bursitis coming back,"There are some things you can do to help stop bursitis coming back.
Do
maintain a healthy weight – being overweight puts more pressure on your joints
clean any cuts on the joints to prevent infections
warm up properly before exercising and playing sport
use padding when putting a lot of pressure on joints (for example, when kneeling)
take regular breaks if you do things that put pressure on a joint, like kneeling
Don’t
do not knock or bang your joints"
Check if you have sciatica,"If you have sciatica, your:
bottom
back of your leg
foot and toes
may feel:
painful – the pain may be stabbing, burning or shooting
tingling – like pins and needles
numb
weak
Your symptoms may be worse when moving, sneezing or coughing.
You may also have back pain, but it's not usually as bad as the pain in your bottom, leg or foot.
Information:
You probably do not have sciatica if you only have back pain."
How you can ease the pain yourself,"Sciatica usually gets better in 4 to 6 weeks, but it can sometimes last longer.
To help relieve your pain and speed up recovery:
Do
carry on with your normal activities as much as possible
regular exercises for sciatica
start gentle exercise as soon as you can – anything that gets you moving can help
hold heat packs to the painful areas – you can buy these from pharmacies
ask your pharmacist about painkillers (paracetamol is unlikely to help and it's not clear how much NSAIDs help with sciatica)
put a small, firm cushion between your knees when sleeping on your side, or several firm pillows underneath your knees when lying on your back
Don’t
do not sit or lie down for long periods – even if moving hurts, it's not harmful and can help you get better faster
do not use hot water bottles to ease the pain – you could scald yourself if your skin is numb"
Treatments from a GP,"If you have sciatica, a GP may:
suggest exercises and stretches
prescribe painkillers
They might also refer you for:
physiotherapy – including exercise advice and techniques like massage (manual therapy)
psychological support – to help you cope with the pain
Physiotherapy is free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK, but waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.
Other treatments for sciatica
If your pain is severe and treatments from a GP have not helped, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for:
painkilling injections
a procedure to seal off some of the nerves in your back so they stop sending pain signals
surgery – an operation called decompression surgery can sometimes help relieve sciatica
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have sciatica, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for sciatica near you"
How to stop sciatica coming back,"To reduce the chances of getting sciatica again:
Do
stay active – take regular exercise
use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects
make sure you have a good posture when sitting and standing
sit correctly when using a computer
lose weight if you're overweight
Don’t
do not smoke – smoking can increase your risk of getting sciatica"
Causes of sciatica,"Sciatica happens when something presses or rubs on the sciatic nerve.
Causes include:
a slipped disc (the most common cause) – when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out
spinal stenosis – narrowing of the part of your spine where nerves pass through
spondylolisthesis – when one of the bones in your spine slips out of position
a back injury"
Why it's carried out,"Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood.
This is supplied by 2 large blood vessels called the left and right coronary arteries.
Over time, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened by the build-up of fatty deposits called plaques.
This process is known as atherosclerosis.
People with atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries are said to have coronary heart disease.
Your chances of developing coronary heart disease increase with age.
You're also much more likely to be affected if:
you smoke
you're overweight or obese
you have a high-fat diet
Coronary heart disease can cause angina, which is chest pain that happens when the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart becomes restricted.
While angina can often be treated with medicine, severe angina may require a coronary artery bypass graft to improve the blood supply to the heart.
Another risk associated with coronary heart disease is the possibility of one of the plaques in the coronary artery rupturing (splitting), creating a blood clot.
If the blood clot blocks the blood supply to the heart, it can trigger a heart attack.
A coronary artery bypass graft may be recommended to reduce your chances of having a heart attack."
The procedure,"A coronary artery bypass graft involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body (usually the chest, leg or arm) and attaching it to the coronary artery above and below the narrowed area or blockage.
This new blood vessel is known as a graft. The number of grafts needed will depend on how severe your coronary heart disease is and how many of the coronary blood vessels are narrowed.
A coronary artery bypass graft is carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the operation. It usually takes between 3 and 6 hours."
Recovery,"Most people will need to stay in hospital for about 6 to 8 days after having a coronary artery bypass graft.
You should have a follow-up appointment, typically about 6 to 8 weeks after your operation.
Recovering takes time and everyone recovers at slightly different speeds.
Generally, you should be able to sit in a chair after 1 day, walk after 3 days, and walk up and down stairs after 5 or 6 days.
When you go home, you'll need to take things easy for a few weeks.
You should be able to return to most of your normal activities after about 6 weeks, including working, driving and having sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to stay off work longer.
Most people make a full recovery within 12 weeks."
Risks of surgery,"As with all types of surgery, a coronary artery bypass graft carries a risk of complications.
These are usually relatively minor and treatable, such as an irregular heartbeat or a wound infection, but there's also a risk of serious complications, such as a stroke or heart attack."
After surgery,"After having a coronary artery bypass graft, most people will experience a significant improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness and chest pain, and their heart attack risk will be lowered.
But a coronary artery bypass graft isn't a cure for coronary heart disease.
If you don't make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, your grafted arteries will also eventually become hardened and narrowed.
Sometimes, a coronary artery bypass graft may need to be repeated or you may need a procedure to widen your arteries using a small balloon and a tube called a stent (coronary angioplasty)."
Alternatives,"A coronary angioplasty is the main alternative to a coronary artery bypass graft.
It's a less invasive operation where a long, flexible, hollow plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your arm or groin.
The tip of the catheter is guided under X-ray to the arteries that supply your heart, to the point where the narrowing of the artery has occurred.
A balloon attached to the catheter is then inflated to widen the artery and a small metal tube called a stent is often used to help keep the artery open.
It usually takes less time to recover from a coronary angioplasty than from a coronary artery bypass graft, but there's a higher chance that the procedure will need to be repeated.
Also, a coronary angioplasty may not be recommended if multiple coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed or the structure of the blood vessels near your heart is abnormal."
How long will I have to wait for surgery?,"The length of time you'll have to wait to have a coronary artery bypass graft will vary from area to area.
Your GP or cardiac surgeon should be able to tell you what the waiting lists are like in your area or at the hospital you have chosen.
Ideally, you should be treated within 3 months of the decision to operate."
Why caesareans are carried out,"A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure or done in an emergency if it's thought a vaginal birth is too risky.
Planned caesareans are usually done from the 39th week of pregnancy.
A caesarean may be carried out because:
your baby is in the breech position (feet first) and your doctor or midwife has been unable to turn them by applying gentle pressure to your tummy, or you'd prefer they did not try this
you have a low-lying placenta (placenta praevia)
you have pregnancy-related high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia)
you have certain infections, such as a first genital herpes infection occurring late in pregnancy or untreated HIV
your baby is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients – sometimes this may mean the baby needs to be delivered immediately
your labour is not progressing or there's excessive vaginal bleeding
If there's time to plan the procedure, your midwife or doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of a caesarean compared with a vaginal birth."
Asking for a caesarean,"Some women choose to have a caesarean for non-medical reasons.
If you ask your midwife or doctor for a caesarean when there are not medical reasons, they'll explain the overall benefits and risks of a caesarean to you and your baby compared with a vaginal birth.
If you're anxious about giving birth, you should be offered the chance to discuss your anxiety with a healthcare professional who can offer support during your pregnancy and labour.
If after discussing all the risks and hearing about all the support on offer you still feel that a vaginal birth is not an acceptable option, you should be offered a planned caesarean. If your doctor is unwilling to perform the operation, they should refer you to a doctor who will."
What happens during a caesarean,"Most caesareans are carried out under spinal or epidural anaesthetic.
This mean you'll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numbed so you will not feel any pain.
During the procedure:
a screen is placed across your body so you cannot see what's being done – the doctors and nurses will let you know what's happening
a cut about 10 to 20cm long will usually be made across your lower tummy and womb so your baby can be delivered
you may feel some tugging and pulling during the procedure
you and your birth partner will be able to see and hold your baby as soon as they have been delivered if they're well – a baby born by emergency caesarean because of foetal distress may be taken straight to a paediatrician for resuscitation
The whole operation normally takes about 40 to 50 minutes.
Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) may be used, particularly if the baby needs to be delivered more quickly.
Find out more about how a caesarean is carried out"
Recovering from a caesarean,"Recovering from a caesarean usually takes longer than recovering from a vaginal delivery.
Providing there are no complications, most women can go home 1 to 2 days after having a caesarean.
You may experience some discomfort in your tummy for the first few days. You'll be offered painkillers to help with this.
When you go home, you'll need to take things easy at first. You may need to avoid some activities, such as driving, until you have had your postnatal check-up with the doctor at 6 weeks.
The wound in your tummy will eventually form a scar. This may be obvious at first, but it should fade with time and will often be hidden in your pubic hair.
Find out more about recovering from a caesarean"
Risks of a caesarean,"A caesarean is generally a very safe procedure, but like any type of surgery it carries a certain amount of risk.
It's important to be aware of the possible complications, particularly if you're considering having a caesarean for non-medical reasons.
Possible complications include:
infection of the wound or womb lining
blood clots
excessive bleeding
damage to nearby areas, such as the bladder or the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder
temporary breathing difficulties in your baby
accidentally cutting your baby when your womb is opened
Find out more about the risks of a caesarean"
Future pregnancies after a caesarean,"If you have a baby by caesarean, it does not necessarily mean that any babies you have in the future will also have to be delivered this way.
Most women who have had a caesarean section can safely have a vaginal delivery for their next baby, known as vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC).
But you may need some extra monitoring during labour just to make sure everything is progressing well.
Some women may be advised to have another caesarean if they have another baby.
This depends on whether a caesarean is still the safest option for them and their baby.
For more information, read the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists leaflet on birth options after previous caesarean section."
Spotting signs of cancer,"Changes to your body's normal processes or unusual, unexplained symptoms can sometimes be an early sign of cancer.
Symptoms that need to be checked by a doctor include:
a lump that suddenly appears on your body
unexplained bleeding
changes to your bowel habits
But in many cases your symptoms will not be related to cancer and will be caused by other, non-cancerous health conditions.
Read more about the signs and symptoms of cancer."
Reducing your risk of cancer,"Making some simple changes to your lifestyle can significantly reduce your risk of developing cancer.
For example:
healthy eating
taking regular exercise
not smoking

Cancer treatment,"Surgery is the first treatment to try for most types of cancer, as solid tumours can usually be surgically removed.
2 other commonly used treatment methods are:
chemotherapy – powerful cancer-killing medicines
radiotherapy – the controlled use of high-energy X-rays"
Waiting times,"Accurately diagnosing cancer can take weeks or months. As cancer often develops slowly over several years, waiting for a few weeks will not usually impact on the effectiveness of treatment.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced referral guidelines for suspected cancer.
You should not have to wait more than 2 weeks to see a specialist if your GP suspects you have cancer and urgently refers you.
In cases where cancer has been confirmed, you should not have to wait more than 31 days from the decision to treat to the start of treatment.
NHS England has more detailed statistics on cancer waiting times"

Can I get a prescription for medical cannabis?,"Very few people in England are likely to get an NHS prescription for medical cannabis.
Currently, it is only likely to be prescribed for the following conditions:
children and adults with rare, severe forms of epilepsy
adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy
people with muscle stiffness and spasms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS)
It would only be considered when other treatments were not suitable or had not helped.
Epidyolex for children and adults with epilepsy
Epidyolex is a highly purified liquid containing CBD (cannabidiol).
CBD is a chemical substance found in cannabis that has medical benefits.
It will not get you high, because it does not contain THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the chemical in cannabis that makes you high.
Epidyolex can be prescribed by a specialist for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome (both rare forms of epilepsy).
Nabilone for chemotherapy patients
Many people having chemotherapy will have periods where they feel sick or vomit.
Nabilone can be prescribed to adults by a specialist to help relieve these symptoms, but only when other treatments have not helped or are not suitable.
Nabilone is a medicine, taken as a capsule, that has been developed to act in a similar way to THC (the chemical in cannabis that makes you high). You may have heard it described as a ""manmade form of cannabis"".
Nabiximols (Sativex) for multiple sclerosis (MS)
Nabiximols (Sativex) is a cannabis-based medicine that is sprayed into the mouth.
It is licensed in the UK for adults with MS-related muscle spasticity that has not got better with other treatments.
Read more from the MS Society on Sativex for treating muscle stiffness and spasms
Long-term pain
There is some evidence medical cannabis can help certain types of pain, though this evidence is not yet strong enough to recommend it for pain relief.
In some cases, however, it may be prescribed for pain as part of a clinical trial."
What about products available to buy?,"Some cannabis-based products are available to buy over the internet without a prescription.
It's likely most of these products – even those called CBD oils – will be illegal to possess or supply. There's a good chance they will contain THC, and may not be safe to use.
Health stores sell certain types of CBD. However, there's no guarantee these products will be of good quality.
They tend to only contain very small amounts of CBD, so it's not clear what effect they would have."
Is medical cannabis safe?,"The risks of using cannabis products containing THC (the chemical that gets you high) are not currently clear. That's why clinical trials are needed before they can be used. Products that only contain CBD, such as Epidyolex, do not carry these unknown risks linked with THC.
But in reality, most products will contain a certain amount of THC.
The potential risks of THC cannabis products are:
psychosis – there is evidence that regular cannabis use in some people can increase the risk of developing a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia
dependency on the medicine – although scientists believe this risk is probably small when its use is controlled and monitored by a specialist doctor
Generally, the more THC the product contains, the greater these risks are.
Cannabis bought illegally off the street, where the quality, ingredients and strength are not known, is the most dangerous form to use.
Read about the risks of regularly smoking cannabis at Talk to Frank"
What are the side effects?,"Depending on the type of medical cannabis you take, it's possible to develop side effects such as:
decreased appetite
diarrhoea
feeling sick
weakness
a behavioural or mood change
dizziness
feeling very tired
feeling high
hallucinations
suicidal thoughts
If you experience any side effects from medical cannabis, report these to your medical team. You can also report them through the Yellow Card Scheme.
CBD and THC can affect how other medicines work. Always discuss possible interactions with a specialist.
CBD can also affect how your liver works, so doctors would need to monitor you regularly."
How do I get a prescription?,"Cannabis-based medicine can only be prescribed on the NHS by a specialist hospital doctor, or under a specialist's supervision.
And it is only likely to be prescribed for a small number of patients.
A hospital specialist might consider prescribing medical cannabis:
for epilepsy – if you (or your child) have one of the rare forms of epilepsy that might be helped by medical cannabis
for MS – if you have spasticity from MS and other treatments for this are not helping
for chemotherapy – if you are vomiting or feeling sick from chemotherapy and other anti-sickness treatments are not helping
The specialist will discuss with you all the other treatment options first, before considering a cannabis-based product.
A prescription for medical cannabis would only be given when it was believed to be in your best interests, and when other treatments had not worked or were not suitable.
It's expected this would only apply to a very small number of people in England.
If the above does not apply to you, do not ask a GP for a referral for medical cannabis.
How do I prove I have a prescription?
Keep your medicine in its original packaging, as the dispensing label contains important information about the medicine and the person it’s prescribed for.
The dispensing label is the label the pharmacist puts on the medicine packet when they give you your prescription medicine.
You should also keep a copy of your prescription, and a letter (if you have one) from the doctor who prescribed the medicine. The letter should include your personal details (including name and address), as well as the prescribing doctor’s name and contact details.
You may need to show ID that matches the details on the dispensing label and the prescription, or the doctor’s letter, if you have one.
Acceptable forms of ID include:
valid passport
photo driving licence
proof of age card, such as a PASS card from the national Proof of Age Standards Scheme
Information:
If you need any legal advice about possessing a cannabis-based medicine, speak to a legal adviser or solicitor.
Read about how to find legal advice on GOV.UK."
Will the laws on cannabis be relaxed?,"The government has no intention of legalising the use of cannabis for recreational (non-medical) use.
Possessing cannabis is illegal, whatever you're using it for. That includes medical use cannabis products, unless these have been prescribed for you."

Check if you have carbon monoxide poisoning,"Carbon monoxide gas is colourless and does not smell, so you cannot tell if it is around you.
Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include:
headache
dizziness
feeling sick or being sick
feeling weak
confusion
chest and muscle pain
shortness of breath
The symptoms may come and go. They may get worse when you spend time in an affected room or building and get better when you leave or go outside."
Causes of carbon monoxide poisoning,"Common household appliances used for heating and cooking can produce carbon monoxide if they are not installed properly, are faulty, or are poorly maintained.
Appliances that can cause carbon monoxide include:
gas boilers
gas cookers and clay ovens
gas or paraffin heaters
wood, gas and coal fires
portable generators
Using barbeques or camping stoves inside, and turning on vehicle or lawn mower engines in your garage, can also cause a build-up of carbon monoxide."
What to do if you think you have carbon monoxide poisoning,"If you think you might have carbon monoxide poisoning:
stop using appliances you think might be making carbon monoxide (such as a boiler, cooker or heater) if you can
open any windows and doors to let fresh air in
go outside
get medical advice as soon as possible – do not go back into the affected building until you have got advice
Information:
If you think a gas appliance is leaking carbon monoxide, call the free National Gas Helpline immediately on 0800 111 999.
The service is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
How to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning,"There are some things you can do to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Do
get a carbon monoxide alarm for each room of your home that contains appliances that burn gas, oil, coal or wood
get heating and cooking appliances properly installed and keep them well maintained
make sure your boiler is serviced regularly by a qualified engineer
keep chimneys and flues clean and well maintained
Don’t
do not use a barbeque or camping stove indoors, or inside a tent
do not leave vehicles or other engines on inside garages"
Treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning,"You may need to be checked in hospital if you have carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if:
you have symptoms of severe carbon monoxide poisoning (for example, you have difficulty breathing or you lost consciousness)
you are pregnant
you are a child or older person
you have anaemia or a condition affecting your lungs, heart or blood vessels
While you are in hospital, you will usually have tests to check the level of carbon monoxide in your blood. If the level is high, you may be given oxygen through a mask."
Why do I need coronary angiography?,"Coronary angiography can be used to help diagnose heart conditions, help plan future treatments and carry out certain procedures.
For example, it may be used:
after a heart attack – where the heart's blood supply is blocked
to help diagnose angina – where pain in the chest is caused by restricted blood supply to the heart
to plan interventional or surgical procedures – such as a coronary angioplasty, where narrowed or blocked blood vessels are widened
Coronary angiography is also considered to be the best method of diagnosing coronary heart disease, where a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries affects the heart's blood supply.
Find out why coronary angiography is used"
What happens during coronary angiography?,"During the procedure a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin or arm.
Using X-ray images as a guide, the tip of the catheter is passed up to the heart and coronary arteries.
A special type of dye called contrast medium is injected through the catheter and X-ray images (angiograms) are taken.
The contrast medium is visible on the angiograms, showing the blood vessels the fluid travels through. This clearly highlights any blood vessels that are narrowed or blocked.
The procedure is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, so you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out, but the area where the catheter is inserted will be numbed."
After coronary angiography,"You'll usually be able to leave hospital on the same day you have a coronary angiography, after a period of rest and observation. You'll need to arrange a lift home from a family member or friend.
Most people feel fine a day or so after having the procedure, although you may feel a bit tired afterwards and the wound site is likely to be tender for up to a week. Any bruising may last for up to 2 weeks.
You'll usually be advised to avoid certain activities, such as bathing and lifting heavy objects, for a day or two after the procedure. Do not drive until you're told it's safe to do so, which may not be for up to 3 days.
While you're recovering, it's important to look out for signs of any problems.
You should seek immediate medical attention if swelling at the site of your wound gets worse, or if you experience excessive bleeding or circulation problems in your limbs."
Complications,"Cardiac catheterisation and coronary angiography are usually very safe.
But as with all procedures, there are some risks, including:
being allergic to the contrast dye – this is uncommon, but you should discuss any allergies you have with your heart specialist (cardiologist) before having the procedure
bleeding under the skin where the catheter was inserted – this should stop after a few days, but you should contact your GP if you're concerned about it
a very small risk of more serious complications, including damage to the artery in the arm or leg where the catheter was inserted, heart attack, stroke, kidney damage and, very rarely, death"
Dilated cardiomyopathy,"In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart become stretched and thin, so they cannot squeeze (contract) properly to pump blood around the body.
How serious is it?
If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure.
Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure.
There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with a GP so the condition can be monitored.
Who's affected?
Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults. 
The following can all play a role in the condition:
inheriting a changed (mutated) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the condition
an underlying medical condition
uncontrolled high blood pressure
an unhealthy lifestyle, such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in your diet, drinking too much alcohol and using recreational drugs
a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle
a heart valve problem
a disease of the tissues or blood vessels – such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy
pregnancy – peripartum cardiomyopathy is rare and sometimes develops during pregnancy, or within 3 months of the baby's birth
But for many people, the cause is unknown.
More information
Read the British Heart Foundation and Cardiomyopathy UK's information on life with dilated cardiomyopathy."
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells enlarge and the walls of the heart chambers thicken.
The heart chambers are reduced in size so they cannot hold much blood, and the walls cannot relax properly and may stiffen. Also, the flow of blood through the heart may be obstructed.
How serious is it?
In most cases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will not have an impact on daily life. Some people do not have any symptoms and do not need treatment.
But that does not mean the condition cannot be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes.
The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation).
Blood flow from the heart may be reduced or restricted (called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).
Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Find out more about mitral valve problems.
You'll also be at greater risk of developing a heart infection (endocarditis).
These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness.
If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored.
Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and recommend lifestyle changes you can make. 
Who's affected?
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents.
More information
Read the British Heart Foundation and Cardiomyopathy UK's information on life with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
Restrictive cardiomyopathy,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare. It's most often diagnosed in children, although it can develop at any age. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiff and rigid and cannot relax properly after contracting. This means the heart cannot fill up properly with blood.
It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems.
In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes the condition can be inherited.
More information
Find out more about restrictive cardiomyopathy from Cardiomyopathy UK."
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM),"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited condition that affects the left or right ventricles, or both. It's sometimes called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCVM).
In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), the proteins that usually hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous scar tissue.
The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched and cannot pump blood around the body properly.
People with ACM usually have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure.
It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes.
There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise makes the symptoms of ACM worse. It's important that people with or at risk of ACM discuss this in detail with their heart specialist (cardiologist).
More information
Find out more about ACM from Cardiomyopathy UK."
Diagnosing cardiomyopathy,"Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as:
electrocardiogram (ECG)
echocardiogram
MRI scan
heart rhythm monitor (24 or 48-hour ECG monitor)
exercise tests
a detailed family tree drawn by specialists may be required for the diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy
If you've been diagnosed with an inherited type of cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the faulty gene (mutation) that caused this.
Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early."
Treating cardiomyopathy,"There's usually no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments can be effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Some types of cardiomyopathy have specific treatments and early diagnosis is very important.
Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the condition they can control after making a few lifestyle changes.
Lifestyle changes
Whether the cause of cardiomyopathy is genetic or not, it should generally help to:
eat a healthy diet and do gentle exercise
quit smoking (if you smoke)
lose weight (if you're overweight)
avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol
get plenty of sleep (as well as diagnose and treat any underlying sleep apnoea)
manage stress
make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled
Medicines
Medicines may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots. 
Find out more about:
treatments for high blood pressure
beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure
anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots
medicines to treat heart failure
Hospital procedures
In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart (septum) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either:
an injection of alcohol into their heart – this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum
a septal myectomy – heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary)
Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have arrhythmia ablation. This treatment carefully alters the diseased heart tissue that causes the heart rhythm problems.
Or they may have a device implanted, such as:
a pacemaker to regulate the heart rate
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to prevent a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm
Find out more about having a pacemaker implanted.
Find out more about implantable cardioverter defibrillators from the British Heart Foundation.
As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary."
Broken heart syndrome,"Some people who experience significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem.
The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or ""stunned"", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during a period of stress.
The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack. Always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these.
The condition – known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy – is more common in women. It's temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.
Find out more about Takotsubo cardiomyopathy on Cardiomyopathy UK."
Types of CVD,"There are many different types of CVD. 4 of the main types are described on this page.
Coronary heart disease
Coronary heart disease occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle is blocked or reduced.
This puts an increased strain on the heart, and can lead to:
angina – chest pain caused by restricted blood flow to the heart muscle
heart attacks – where the blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked
heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly
Read more about coronary heart disease.
Strokes and TIAs
A stroke is where the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, which can cause brain damage and possibly death.
A transient ischaemic attack (also called a TIA or ""mini-stroke"") is similar, but the blood flow to the brain is only temporarily disrupted.
The main symptoms of a stroke or TIA can be remembered with the word FAST, which stands for:
Face – the face may have drooped on one side, the person may be unable to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped.
Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm.
Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, they may not be able to talk at all or they may not be able to understand what you are saying to them.
Time – it's time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms.
Read more about stroke and TIAs.
Peripheral arterial disease
Peripheral arterial disease occurs when there's a blockage in the arteries to the limbs, usually the legs.
This can cause:
dull or cramping leg pain, which is worse when walking and gets better with rest
hair loss on the legs and feet
numbness or weakness in the legs
persistent ulcers (open sores) on the feet and legs
Read more about peripheral arterial disease.
Aortic disease
Aortic diseases are a group of conditions affecting the aorta. This is the largest blood vessel in the body, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.
One of most common aortic diseases is an aortic aneurysm, where the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards.
This doesn't usually have any symptoms, but there's a chance it could burst and cause life-threatening bleeding.
Read more about aortic aneurysm."
Causes of CVD,"The exact cause of CVD isn't clear, but there are lots of things that can increase your risk of getting it. These are called ""risk factors"".
The more risk factors you have, the greater your chances of developing CVD.
If you're over 40, you'll be invited by your GP for an NHS Health Check every 5 years.
Part of this check involves assessing your individual CVD risk and advising you how to reduce it if necessary.
High blood pressure
High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important risk factors for CVD. If your blood pressure is too high, it can damage your blood vessels.
Read more about high blood pressure.
Smoking
Smoking and other tobacco use is also a significant risk factor for CVD. The harmful substances in tobacco can damage and narrow your blood vessels.
High cholesterol
Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. If you have high cholesterol, it can cause your blood vessels to narrow and increase your risk of developing a blood clot.
Read more about high cholesterol.
Diabetes
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high.
High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrowed.
Many people with type 2 diabetes are also overweight or obese, which is also a risk factor for CVD.
Inactivity
If you don't exercise regularly, it's more likely that you'll have high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and be overweight. All of these are risk factors for CVD.
Exercising regularly will help keep your heart healthy. When combined with a healthy diet, exercise can also help you maintain a healthy weight.
Being overweight or obese
Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for CVD.
You're at an increased risk of CVD if:
your body mass index (BMI) is 25 or above – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI
you're a man with a waist measurement of 94cm (about 37 inches) or more, or a woman with a waist measurement of 80cm (about 31.5 inches) or more
Read more about obesity.
Family history of CVD
If you have a family history of CVD, your risk of developing it is also increased.
You're considered to have a family history of CVD if either:
your father or brother were diagnosed with CVD before they were 55
your mother or sister were diagnosed with CVD before they were 65
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a family history of CVD. They may suggest checking your blood pressure and cholesterol level.
Ethnic background
In the UK people of south Asian and Black African or African Caribbean background have an increased risk of getting CVD.
This is because people from these backgrounds are more likely to have other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes.
Other risk factors
Other factors that affect your risk of developing CVD include:
age – CVD is most common in people over 50 and your risk of developing it increases as you get older
gender – men are more likely to develop CVD at an earlier age than women
diet – an unhealthy diet can lead to high cholesterol and high blood pressure
alcohol – excessive alcohol consumption can also increase your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and contribute to weight gain"
Preventing CVD,"A healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of CVD. If you already have CVD, staying as healthy as possible can reduce the chances of it getting worse.
Stop smoking
If you smoke, you should try to give up as soon as possible. The NHS Better Health website can provide information, support and advice to help.
Your GP can also provide you with advice and support. They can also prescribe medication to help you quit.
Read more about stopping smoking and stop smoking treatments.
Have a balanced diet
A healthy, balanced diet is recommended for a healthy heart.
A balanced diet includes:
low levels of saturated fat – try to include healthier sources of fat, such as oily fish, nuts and seeds, and olive oil, and avoid unhealthy fats such as fatty cuts of meat, lard, cream, cakes and biscuits
low levels of salt – aim for less than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day
low levels of sugar
plenty of fibre and wholegrain foods
plenty of fruit and vegetables – eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
Read more about healthy eating.
Exercise regularly
Adults are advised to do at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as cycling or brisk walking.
If you find it difficult to do this, start at a level you feel comfortable with and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your activity as your fitness improves.
Visit your GP for a health check if you haven't exercised before or you're returning to exercise after a long break.
Read advice about starting exercise.
Maintain a healthy weight
If you're overweight or obese, a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you lose weight.
If you're struggling to lose weight, your GP or practice nurse can help you come up with a weight loss plan and recommend services in your area.
Read more about losing weight and how your GP can help.
Cut down on alcohol
If you drink alcohol, try not to exceed the recommended limit of 14 alcohol units a week for men and women.
If you do drink this much, you should aim to spread your drinking over 3 days or more.
A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.
Your GP can give you help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down your drinking.
Medicine
If you have a particularly high risk of developing CVD due to high blood cholesterol, your GP may recommend taking medicines called statins to reduce your risk."
About the procedure,"A carotid endarterectomy can be carried out using either local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.
The advantage of local anaesthetic is it allows the surgeon to monitor brain function while you're awake. But there's no evidence that either is safer or better.
During the procedure, a 7 to 10cm cut is made on the side of the neck and then a small cut is made along the narrowed section of artery, so the fatty deposits can be removed.
The artery is closed with stitches or a patch and your skin is also closed with stitches."
What happens after the procedure,"You'll usually be moved to the recovery area of the operating theatre for monitoring for about 3 hours, before returning to the vascular ward.
Most people are well enough to go home within about 48 hours of the procedure.
In most cases, the only problems experienced after the operation are temporary numbness or discomfort in the neck.
But there's a small risk of more serious complications, which can include stroke or death in 2 to 3% of cases.
Nevertheless, this risk is much lower than in people with carotid artery disease who haven't chosen to have the operation."
Are there any alternatives?,"Carotid endarterectomy is the main treatment for narrowing of the carotid arteries, but sometimes an alternative procedure called carotid artery stent placement may be available.
It's a less invasive procedure than a carotid endarterectomy because there's no need to make a cut in the neck.
Instead, a thin flexible tube is guided to the carotid artery through a small cut in the groin. 
A mesh cylinder (stent) is then placed into the narrowed section of artery to widen it and allow blood to flow through it more easily.
Current guidelines recommend that a carotid endarterectomy should be the first line of treatment for most people.
This is because carotid stenting is associated with a higher risk of stroke during the procedure, particularly if it's carried out in the first few days after symptoms appear.
But it's an important alternative for some people who may otherwise be considered to be high risk because of other medical problems.
Find out more about carotid artery alternatives"
Check if you have carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),"The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include:
an ache or pain in your fingers, hand or arm
numb hands
tingling or pins and needles
a weak thumb or difficulty gripping
These symptoms often start slowly and come and go. They're usually worse at night."
How to treat carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) yourself,"CTS sometimes gets better by itself in a few months, particularly if you have it because you're pregnant.
Wear a wrist splint
A wrist splint is something you wear on your hand to keep your wrist straight. It helps to relieve pressure on the nerve.
You wear it at night while you sleep. You'll have to wear a splint for at least 4 weeks before it starts to feel better.
You can buy wrist splints online or from pharmacies.
Stop or cut down on things that may be causing it
Stop or cut down on anything that causes you to frequently bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools for work or playing an instrument.
Painkillers
Painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen may help carpal tunnel pain short-term.
But there's little evidence to say they can treat the cause of CTS, so it's important not to rely on them.
Hand exercises
There's a small amount of evidence to suggest hand exercises help ease the symptoms of CTS."
Treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) from a GP,"If a wrist splint does not help, the GP might recommend a steroid injection into your wrist. This brings down swelling around the nerve, easing the symptoms of CTS.
Steroid injections are not always a cure. CTS can come back after a few months and you may need another injection.
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have carpal tunnel syndrome, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome near you
Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery
If your CTS is getting worse and other treatments have not worked, the GP might refer you to a specialist to discuss surgery.
Surgery usually cures CTS. You and your specialist will decide together if it's the right treatment for you.
An injection numbs your wrist so you do not feel pain (local anaesthetic) and a small cut is made in your hand. The carpal tunnel inside your wrist is cut so it no longer puts pressure on the nerve.
The operation takes around 20 minutes and you do not have to stay in hospital overnight.
It can take a month after the operation to get back to normal activities."
What causes carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),"CTS happens when the carpal tunnel inside your wrist swells and squeezes 1 of your nerves (median nerve).
You're more at risk if you:
are overweight
are pregnant
do work or hobbies that mean you repeatedly bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools
have another illness, such as arthritis or diabetes
have a parent, brother or sister with CTS
have previously injured your wrist"
What are cataracts?,"Cataracts are when the lens of your eye, a small transparent disc, develops cloudy patches.
When we're young, our lenses are usually like clear glass, allowing us to see through them.
As we get older they start to become frosted, like bathroom glass, and begin to limit our vision.
Cataracts most commonly affect adults as a result of ageing.
Find out more about age-related cataracts"
Do you need surgery?,"If you have cataracts, it's your decision whether or not to go ahead with cataract surgery.
Cataracts usually get slowly worse over time. Surgery to replace the cloudy lens is the only way to improve your eyesight.
Surgery is usually offered on the NHS if your cataracts are affecting your eyesight and quality of life.
The decision to have surgery should not be based solely on your eye test (visual acuity) results.
You may have other personal reasons for deciding to have surgery, such as your daily activities, hobbies and interests.
You can choose to put off having surgery for a while and have regular check-ups to monitor the situation.
There are no medicines or eye drops that have been proven to improve cataracts or stop them getting worse."
Before the operation,"Before surgery, you'll be referred to a specialist eye doctor for an assessment.
During the assessment different measurements will be taken of your eyes and your eyesight.
The assessment is an opportunity to discuss anything to do with your operation, including:
your lens preference, such as near sight or long sight
the risks and benefits of surgery
if you'll need glasses after surgery
how long you'll take to fully recover
If you're used to using 1 eye for distance and 1 for reading, which is called monovision, you can ask to stay that way.
This usually means you'll get a near-sight lens fitted in 1 eye and a long-sighted lens fitted in the other eye."
The operation,"Cataract surgery is a straightforward procedure that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.
It's often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic and you should be able to go home on the same day.
During the operation, the surgeon will make a tiny cut in your eye to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear plastic one.
With the NHS, you'll usually be offered monofocal lenses, which have a single point of focus. This means the lens will be fixed for either near or distance vision, but not both.
If you go private, you may be able to choose either a multifocal or an accommodating lens, which allow the eye to focus on both near and distant objects.
Most people will need to wear glasses for some tasks, like reading, after surgery regardless of the type of lens they have fitted.
If you have cataracts in both eyes it may be recommended that both eyes are treated on the same day. This procedure is known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). ISBCS is usually only recommended for people thought to have a low risk of complications. The surgeon will discuss this with you if this is an option.
Otherwise, surgery is done 6 to 12 weeks apart to allow the recovery one eye at a time.
Find out more about recovering from cataract surgery"
Benefits of surgery,"After cataract surgery you should be able to:
see things in focus
look into bright lights and not see as much glare
tell the difference between colours
If you have another condition affecting your eyes, such as diabetes or glaucoma, you may still have limited vision, even after successful surgery."
Risks of surgery,"The risk of serious complications developing as a result of cataract surgery is estimated at around 1 in 50 cases.
These can include:
blurred vision
some loss of vision
detached retina – where the the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose
Most of these serious complications can be treated with medicines or further surgery.
There is a very small risk – around 1 in 1,000 – of permanent sight loss in the treated eye as a direct result of the operation."
Symptoms of cataracts in children,"In children, cataracts can affect 1 or both eyes.
Cloudy patches in the lens can sometimes get bigger and more can develop, resulting in the child's vision becoming increasingly affected.
As well as poor vision, cataracts can also cause ""wobbling eyes"" and a squint, where the eyes point in different directions. 
When your child is very young, it can be difficult to spot signs of cataracts.
But your baby's eyes will be routinely examined at their newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of birth, and again when they're 6 to 8 weeks old.
If a congenital cataract is suspected at the newborn examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby within 2 weeks of the examination.
If a congenital cataract is suspected at the 6 to 8 week examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby by the time they're 11 weeks old.
Sometimes cataracts can develop in children after these screening tests.
It's particularly important to spot cataracts in children quickly because early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term vision problems.
You should visit a GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight.
Read more about the symptoms of childhood cataracts and diagnosing childhood cataracts."
What causes cataracts in children?,"There are a number of reasons why a child may be born with cataracts or develop them while they're still young.
But in many cases it is not possible to determine the exact cause.
Possible causes include:
a genetic fault inherited from the child's parents that caused the lens to develop abnormally
certain genetic conditions, including Down's syndrome
certain infections picked up by the mother during pregnancy, including rubella and chickenpox
an injury to the eye after birth
Read more about the causes of childhood cataracts."
How childhood cataracts are treated,"Cataracts in children are often not too bad and have little or no effect on their vision.
But if cataracts are affecting your child's vision, they can slow down or stop their normal sight development.
In these cases, surgery to remove the affected lens (or lenses) will usually be recommended as soon as possible.
Replacing the focusing power of the lens is as important as the surgery to remove it.
The affected lens may sometimes be replaced with an artificial lens during surgery. But it's more common for the child to wear contact lenses or glasses after surgery to compensate for the lens that was removed.
It can be difficult to predict exactly how much better your child's vision will be after treatment. It's likely there will always be a degree of reduced vision in the affected eye (or eyes).
But many children born with childhood cataracts do not grow up to have serious problems with their vision.
Read more about treating childhood cataracts."
What are the risks?,"Cataracts that affect vision that are not quickly treated can sometimes cause irreversible damage to eyesight, including a permanently lazy eye and even blindness in severe cases.
Cataract surgery is generally successful, with a low risk of serious complications.
The most common risk associated with cataract surgery is a condition that can affect artificial lens implants called posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which causes cloudy vision to return.
Another important risk of surgery is glaucoma, where pressure builds inside the eye.
Without successful treatment, glaucoma can cause irreversible damage to key structures in the eye.
Although some of the possible complications of cataract surgery can affect your child's vision, they can often be treated with medicine or further surgery.
Read more about the complications of childhood cataracts."
Can cataracts in children be prevented?,"It's not usually possible to prevent cataracts, particularly those that are inherited (run in the family).
But following the advice of your midwife or a GP to avoid infections during pregnancy (including making sure all your vaccinations are up to date before getting pregnant) may reduce the chances of your child being born with cataracts.
If you previously had a baby with childhood cataracts and are planning another pregnancy, you may wish to speak with a GP about whether genetic counselling would be appropriate.
Genetic counselling can help couples who may be at risk of passing an inherited condition on to their child.
Read more about infections in pregnancy and genetic and genomic testing."
Information about your child,"If your child has had cataracts, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register on GOV.UK"
Check if you have catarrh,"You may get catarrh if you have an infection like a cold, flu or sinusitis.
Symptoms of catarrh include:
a constantly blocked nose
feeling like there's a lump or something stuck in your throat
a frequent need to swallow or cough to try to clear your throat
a feeling that mucus is slowly dripping down the back of your throat (postnasal drip)
a crackling feeling in your ears
These symptoms usually only last a few days, but sometimes they can last longer."
Things you can do to help ease catarrh,"Although catarrh can be annoying, phlegm and mucus are not harmful and are the body's way of clearing infection.
It usually goes away by itself, but there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms.
Do
drink plenty of water
sip ice cold water when you need to clear your throat, rather than coughing or swallowing
try using a humidifier to help loosen the mucus in your nose and throat
try using an extra pillow in bed so you sleep in a more upright position, rather than lying flat
try gargling with salt water
try rinsing your nose with salt water
How to rinse your nose with a homemade salt water solution
A pharmacist can help with catarrh
You could ask a pharmacist about:
decongestants and other medicines to help relieve catarrh
salt water nose rinses – you can get several types, including specially designed bottles, nasal sprays and sachets
Find a pharmacy"
Treatments from a GP,"A GP may suggest trying treatments for catarrh that you can get from a pharmacist, like decongestant medicines and salt water nose rinses.
If your catarrh is caused by nasal polyps, a GP may prescribe steroid spray or nose drops. If these do not work, surgery may be needed to remove the polyps."
Causes of catarrh,"Catarrh is your body's natural reaction to things like infection.
The lining in your nose, sinuses and throat becomes swollen and creates more mucus than normal.
Causes of catarrh include:
infections like cold, flu and sinusitis
pollution and cigarette smoke
allergic reactions to things like pollen, dust and animals
conditions that affect the nose, such as nasal polyps"
Symptoms of cavernoma,"A cavernoma often does not cause symptoms, but when symptoms do occur they can include:
bleeding (haemorrhage)
fits (seizures)
headaches
neurological problems, such as dizziness, slurred speech (dysarthria), double vision, balance problems and tremor
weakness, numbness, tiredness, memory problems and difficulty concentrating
a type of stroke called a haemorrhagic stroke
The severity and duration of symptoms can vary depending on the size, location and number of cavernomas.
Problems can occur if the cavernoma bleeds or presses on certain areas of the brain.
The cells lining a cavernoma are often thinner than those that line normal blood vessels, which means they're prone to leaking blood.
In most cases, bleeding is small – usually around half a teaspoonful of blood – and may not cause other symptoms. 
But severe haemorrhages can be life threatening and may lead to long-lasting problems.
You should seek medical help as soon as possible if you experience any of the above symptoms for the first time."
What causes a cavernoma?,"In most cases, there's no clear reason why a person develops a cavernoma. The condition can sometimes run in families – less than 50% of cases are thought to be genetic.
But in most cases cavernomas occur randomly. Genetic testing can be carried out to determine whether a cavernoma is genetic or whether it's occurred randomly. 
If you or your partner have the genetic type of cavernoma, there's a 1 in 2 chance of passing on the condition to any children that you conceive.
Some cavernoma cases have also been linked to radiation exposure, such as previously having radiotherapy to the brain, usually as a child. Read more about medical radiation on the GOV.UK website."
Who's affected,"It's estimated about 1 in every 600 people in the UK has a cavernoma that does not cause symptoms. 
Every year, around 1 person in every 400,000 in the UK is diagnosed with a cavernoma that has caused symptoms.
If symptoms do occur, most people will develop them between the ages of 20 and 40."
Diagnosing cavernoma,"MRI scans are mainly used to diagnose cavernomas.
As symptoms are not always evident, many people are only diagnosed with a cavernoma after having an MRI scan for another reason.
A CT scan or angiography can also be used to diagnose cavernoma, but they're not as reliable as an MRI scan."
Monitoring your symptoms,"Any symptoms you have may come and go as the cavernoma bleeds and then reabsorbs blood.
It's important to closely monitor your symptoms, as any new symptoms might be a sign of a haemorrhage.
Your doctor can advise you about what to do if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
They may also recommend having a further brain scan.
MRI and CT scans can be used to detect bleeding on the brain, although they cannot necessarily identify cavernomas at an increased risk of bleeding.
This is because the features of a cavernoma that can be seen on a brain scan, such as an increase in size, do not appear to be directly linked to the likelihood of bleeding.
Although cavernomas can get bigger, large cavernomas are not any more likely to bleed than smaller ones."
What are the chances of a cavernoma bleeding?,"The risk of having a haemorrhage varies from person to person, depending on whether you have experienced any bleeding before.
If you have not had any bleeding before, it's estimated you have a less than 1% chance of experiencing a haemorrhage each year.
If your cavernoma has bled previously, your risk of having another haemorrhage is somewhere between 4% and 25% each year.
But this risk decreases progressively over time if you do not experience any further bleeds.
Your level of risk will be one of the main factors taken into consideration when deciding if you would benefit from treatment."
Treating cavernoma,"The recommended treatment for cavernoma will vary depending on a person's circumstances and factors such as size, location and number of cavernoma.
Some cavernoma symptoms, such as headaches and seizures, can be controlled with medication.
But more invasive treatment may sometimes be offered to reduce the risk of future haemorrhages.
The decision to have such treatment is made on a case-by-case basis in discussion with your doctor.
Types of treatment offered in the UK to reduce the risk of haemorrhages include:
neurosurgery – carried out under general anaesthetic to remove the cavernoma
stereotactic radiosurgery – where a single concentrated dose of radiation is aimed directly at the cavernoma, causing it to become thickened and scarred
In most cases, neurosurgery is preferred to stereotactic radiosurgery because the effectiveness of radiosurgery in preventing haemorrhages is unknown.
Stereotactic radiosurgery is usually only considered if the position of the cavernoma makes neurosurgery too difficult or dangerous. 
Risks of invasive treatment include stroke and death, although the exact risks depend on the location of the cavernoma.
You should discuss the possible risks of treatment with your doctor beforehand."
Driving,"If you have a cavernoma that's causing symptoms, it may affect how you drive.
Legally, you have to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that you have a cavernoma.
If you have been diagnosed with a cavernoma, you may be advised to stop driving until your symptoms are controlled.
The GOV.UK website has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition."
Further information,"International research programmes are trying to find out more about what causes cavernoma and how these abnormal blood vessels are formed.
The long-term outlook for people with cavernomas is also being investigated.
The Cavernoma Alliance UK website has more information about the condition."
When to seek medical advice,"Call 111 immediately if you experience:
a severe headache that is not relieved with painkillers or is getting worse
a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over
a headache that's unusual for you and occurs with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or seizures (fits)
eye pain or swelling of one or both eyes
a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin
shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain
While it's highly unlikely to be the result of cavernous sinus thrombosis, these symptoms need to be investigated.
In very rare cases, cavernous sinus thrombosis can occur after having some types of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. If this happens, symptoms can appear between 4 days and 4 weeks after vaccination.
After an examination, you may be referred for tests, including a CT scan, an MRI scan and blood tests."
Treating cavernous sinus thrombosis,"Cavernous sinus thrombosis needs treatment in hospital.
In most cases, you'll be treated in an intensive care unit, so you can be closely monitored.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are the main treatment for cavernous sinus thrombosis. Treatment will be started as soon as possible, even before tests have confirmed if a bacterial infection is responsible.
If tests later show that a bacterial infection did not cause the condition, antibiotic treatment may be stopped.
Most people will require antibiotics for a few weeks to ensure the infection has been fully cleared from their body. The antibiotics will be given through an intravenous drip directly connected to one of your veins.
Some people will experience side effects when taking antibiotics. These are generally mild and can include diarrhoea, nausea and a skin rash.
Anticoagulants
You may also be given a medicine called heparin to help dissolve the clot and prevent further clots. Heparin is an anticoagulant medicine, which means it makes the blood less sticky.
Some people also need to take anticoagulant tablets for a few months or longer after leaving hospital.
Corticosteroids
Some people are also given steroid medicine (corticosteroids). Corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and swelling in your body.
Surgical drainage
If the symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis were caused by an infection spreading from a boil or sinusitis, it may be necessary to drain away pus from that site. This can be done either using a needle or during surgery.
How long does treatment last?
Several weeks of antibiotic treatment are usually necessary to ensure the infection has cleared. However, it can take a long time to recover fully, and it may be several months before you're well enough to leave hospital."
Complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis,"Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very serious condition. Even with prompt treatment, as many as 1 in 3 people with the condition may die.
Some people who survive will develop long-term health problems due to damage to their brain, such as persistent headaches and fits, or some degree of vision loss.
Read more about the complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis."
Who's affected?,"It's difficult to say exactly how many people are affected by cavernous sinus thrombosis, but it's thought to be very rare.
The condition affects people of all ages and tends to be more common in women than men. This may be because pregnancy and taking the oral contraceptive pill can make women more vulnerable to blood clots."
Symptoms of cellulitis,"Cellulitis makes your skin painful, hot and swollen. The area usually looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin.
Your skin may also be blistered, and you can also have swollen, painful glands.
You can get cellulitis on any part of your body, such as:
Hands – causing swelling in your fingers or the back of your hand.
Credit:
Feet – sometimes near toes if you have athlete's foot.
Credit:
Legs – usually the lower legs.
Credit:
Eye – which is very serious. The white part of your eye may become red, but this does not always happen.
Credit:"
Treatment for cellulitis,"For mild cellulitis affecting a small area of skin, a doctor will prescribe antibiotic tablets – usually for a week.
Your symptoms might get worse in the first 48 hours of treatment, but should then start to improve.
Contact a GP if you do not start to feel better 2 to 3 days after starting antibiotics.
It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better.
Most people make a full recovery after 7 to 10 days.
If cellulitis is severe, you might be referred to hospital for treatment."
Things you can do yourself,"As well as taking antibiotics for cellulitis, you can help speed up your recovery by:
taking paracetamol or ibuprofen for the pain
raising the affected body part on a pillow or chair when you're sitting or lying down, to reduce swelling
regularly moving the joint near the affected body part, such as your wrist or ankle, to stop it getting stiff
drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
not wearing compression stockings until you're better
You can reduce the chances of getting cellulitis again by:
keeping skin clean and well moisturised
cleaning any cuts or wounds and using antiseptic cream
preventing cuts and scrapes by wearing appropriate clothing and footwear
wearing gloves if working outside"
Cellulitis complications,"If it's not treated quickly, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the blood, muscles and bones.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E now if you have cellulitis with:
a very high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery
a fast heartbeat or fast breathing
purple patches on your skin, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin
feeling dizzy or faint
confusion or disorientation
cold, clammy or pale skin
unresponsiveness or loss of consciousness
These are symptoms of serious complications, which can be life threatening."
What causes cellulitis,"Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection.
The bacteria can infect the deeper layers of your skin if it's broken, for example, because of an insect bite or cut, or if it's cracked and dry.
Sometimes the break in the skin is too small to notice.
You cannot catch cellulitis from another person, as it affects the deeper layers of the skin.
You're more at risk of cellulitis if you:
have poor circulation in your arms, legs, hands or feet, for example, because you're overweight
find it difficult to move around
have a weakened immune system, for example, because of chemotherapy treatment or diabetes
have lymphoedema, which causes fluid build-up under the skin
inject drugs
have a wound from surgery
have had cellulitis before
People who are more at risk of cellulitis should treat athlete's foot promptly."
Symptoms of cerebral palsy,"The symptoms of cerebral palsy are not usually obvious just after a baby is born. They normally become noticeable from an early age.
Symptoms can include:
delays in reaching development milestones – for example, not sitting by 8 months or not walking by 18 months
seeming too stiff or too floppy
weak arms or legs
fidgety, jerky or clumsy movements
random, uncontrolled movements
walking on tiptoes
a range of other problems – such as swallowing problems, speaking problems, vision problems and learning disabilities
The severity of symptoms can vary significantly. Some people only have minor problems, while others may be severely disabled.
Read more about the symptoms of cerebral palsy"
When to get medical advice,"Speak to your health visitor or a GP if you have any concerns about your child's health or development.
Symptoms like those of cerebral palsy can have a number of different causes and are not necessarily a sign of anything serious.
Your child may be referred to specialists in child development who can do some checks and tests.
Read more about tests for cerebral palsy"
Causes of cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy can happen if a baby's brain does not develop normally while they're in the womb, or is damaged during or soon after birth.
Causes of cerebral palsy include:
bleeding in the baby's brain or reduced blood and oxygen supply to their brain
an infection caught during pregnancy
the brain temporarily not getting enough oxygen (asphyxiation) during a difficult birth

Treatments for cerebral palsy,"There's currently no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatments are available to help people with the condition be as active and independent as possible.
Treatments include:
physiotherapy – techniques such as exercise and stretching to help maintain physical ability and hopefully improve movement problems
speech therapy to help with speech and communication, and swallowing difficulties
occupational therapy – where a therapist identifies problems that you or your child have carrying out everyday tasks, and suggests ways to make these easier
medicine for muscle stiffness and other difficulties
in some cases, surgery to treat movement or growth problems
A team of healthcare professionals will work with you to come up with a treatment plan that meets your or your child's needs.

Outlook for cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy affects each person differently and it can be difficult to predict what the outlook will be for you or your child.
Generally speaking:
most children live into adult life and some can live for many decades
the condition may limit your child's activities and independence, although many people go on to lead full, independent lives
many children go to a mainstream school, but some may have special educational needs and benefit from attending a special school
the original problem with the brain does not get worse over time, but the condition can put a lot of strain on the body and cause problems, such as painful joints, in later life
the daily challenges of living with cerebral palsy can be difficult to cope with, which can lead to problems such as clinical depression in some people
Speak to your care team about the likely effects of cerebral palsy on you or your child."
Help and support,"If you or your child have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, you may find it useful to contact a support group for information and advice.
Scope is the main UK charity for people with cerebral palsy and their families. They offer:
an online community

Check if it's cervical spondylosis,"Symptoms of cervical spondylosis include:
neck and shoulder pain or stiffness that can come and go
headaches that often start at the back of the neck
Cervical spondylosis is a normal part of ageing and many people do not have any symptoms."
How to ease cervical spondylosis symptoms,"There are things you can do to help ease neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis.
Do
try gentle neck exercises
improve your posture
take painkillers, like paracetamol and ibuprofen, to ease any pain and stiffness
A pharmacist can help with cervical spondylosis
A pharmacist may be able to recommend stronger painkillers if you need them.
Find a pharmacy"
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP will examine your neck and shoulder if they think you may have cervical spondylosis.
They may also test your reflexes and watch you walk.
Depending on your symptoms you may be sent for other tests such as X-rays or scans."
Treatment for cervical spondylosis,"Treatment for cervical spondylosis depends on how bad your symptoms are.
The GP may give you more exercises to do and recommend you carry out your usual activities as much as possible.
The GP may also prescribe a muscle relaxant or other medicine if the pain has been coming and going for a long time (chronic pain).
It usually takes a few weeks for treatment to work, although the pain and stiffness can come back.
Surgery is only considered if:
a nerve is being pinched by a slipped disc or bone (cervical radiculopathy)
there's a problem with your spinal cord (cervical myelopathy)
Surgery is not always a cure but it may stop your symptoms getting worse.
Physiotherapy for cervical spondylosis
If your symptoms do not improve in a few weeks the GP may recommend physiotherapy.
Waiting times for physiotherapy on the NHS can be long.
You can also get physiotherapy privately."
Causes of cervical spondylosis,"Many people over 40 get cervical spondylosis as part of getting older.
It happens when ageing causes wear and tear to bones in the spine and the soft cushions of tissue (discs) in the neck.
You may also be more likely to get cervical spondylosis at any age if:
you have previously had a neck injury
you have a family history of the condition"
What causes CMT?,"CMT is caused by an inherited fault in one of the many genes responsible for the development of the peripheral nerves. This fault means the nerves become damaged over time.
A child with CMT may have inherited the genetic fault responsible for the condition from 1 or both of their parents.
There's no single faulty gene that causes CMT. There are many types of CMT that are caused by different genetic faults and these can be inherited in several different ways.
The chances of passing CMT to your child depend on the specific genetic faults you and your partner carry.
Find out more about the causes of CMT"
Testing for CMT,"See your GP if you think you may have symptoms of CMT.
If they suspect CMT, they'll refer you to a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist) for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.
You should also see your GP if you or your partner have a family history of CMT and are considering having a baby.
Your GP can refer you for genetic counselling, where you can discuss your concerns and the options available with a genetics specialist.
Find out more about diagnosing CMT"
How CMT is treated,"There's currently no cure for CMT. But treatments can help relieve symptoms, aid mobility, and increase independence and quality of life for people with the condition.
These treatments may include:
physiotherapy and certain types of exercise
occupational therapy
walking aids
In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct problems such as flat feet and muscle contractures, where muscles shorten and lose their normal range of movement.
Find out more about treating CMT"
Living with CMT,"CMT is not life threatening and most people with the condition have the same life expectancy as a person without the condition.
But it can make everyday activities very difficult. Living with a long-term progressive condition can also have a significant emotional impact.
Some people find it helpful to speak to others with the condition through support groups.
You may also benefit from a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
More information, support and practical advice about living with CMT can be found on the Charcot-Marie-Tooth UK website.
CMT UK is the main charity and support group for people with CMT in the UK."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have CMT, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat CMT. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Check if it's Charles Bonnet syndrome,"The main symptom of Charles Bonnet syndrome is seeing things that are not real (hallucinations) after losing a lot of your sight.
It's often linked to eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration or cataracts.
The hallucinations can:
be patterns such as shapes or lines
be of people, animals, objects or places
be moving or still
be in black and white or colour
happen suddenly
last for a few minutes or several hours
The hallucinations are only things you see. You do not hear, smell or feel things that are not there.
Most people with Charles Bonnet syndrome know the hallucinations are not real."
Treatments for Charles Bonnet syndrome,"There's currently no cure for Charles Bonnet syndrome, but over time the hallucinations usually happen less often.
If you're finding the hallucinations upsetting, speak to a GP.
They can refer you for talking therapy that can help with hallucinations."
Things you can do to help with Charles Bonnet syndrome,"There's some things you can try when a hallucination starts that may make it go away.
Do
turn on the lights or move somewhere lighter if it's dark when you have a hallucination
turn off the lights or move somewhere darker if it's light when you have a hallucination
move your eyes from left to right without moving your head – do this 15 to 30 times, then pause and repeat a few times
stand up and move around
watch TV or listen to the radio
reach out to touch the hallucination
Other things that can help
There are some other things that can help if you have Charles Bonnet syndrome, such as:
making sure you're well rested and are getting enough sleep at night – the hallucinations may be worse when you're tired or stressed
using bright light bulbs in your home and using a magnifying device to make things bigger when you need to – making use of the sight you have may help the hallucinations happen less often
getting regular eye tests – an optician can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of the sight you have
A GP, optician or ophthalmologist (eye doctor) can refer you to a specialist low-vision service for advice about things to help with your sight."
Causes of Charles Bonnet syndrome,"Charles Bonnet syndrome is linked to vision loss.
When you lose your sight, your brain gets less information from your eyes than it's used to. Your brain sometimes makes up for this by creating hallucinations.
Not everyone who loses their sight will get Charles Bonnet syndrome. You're more likely to get it if:
your sight suddenly gets worse
you lose sight in both eyes
It's common in people who have eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration or cataracts.
Charles Bonnet syndrome is not caused by a mental health problem or dementia."
Help and support,"There are some charities and organisations that provide information and support for people with Charles Bonnet syndrome.
Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB): Charles Bonnet syndrome
The Macular Society: Charles Bonnet syndrome
Esme's umbrella: Charles Bonnet syndrome support and information"
When chemotherapy is used,"Chemotherapy may be used if cancer has spread or there's a risk it will.
It can be used to:
try to cure the cancer completely (curative chemotherapy)
make other treatments more effective – for example, it can be combined with radiotherapy (chemoradiation) or used before surgery (neo-adjuvant chemotherapy)
reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after radiotherapy or surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy)
relieve symptoms if a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy)
The effectiveness of chemotherapy varies significantly. Ask your doctors about the chances of treatment being successful for you."
Types of chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy can be given in several ways. Your doctors will recommend the best type for you.
The most common types are:
chemotherapy given into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy) – this is usually done in hospital and involves medicine being given through a tube in a vein in your hand, arm or chest
chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy) – this usually involves taking a course of medicine at home, with regular check-ups in hospital
You may be treated with one type of chemotherapy medicine or a combination of different types.
You'll usually have several treatment sessions, which will typically be spread over the course of a few months."
Side effects of chemotherapy,"As well as killing cancer cells, chemotherapy can damage some healthy cells in your body, such as blood cells, skin cells and cells in the stomach.
This can cause a range of unpleasant side effects, such as:
feeling tired most of the time
feeling and being sick
hair loss
an increased risk of getting infections
a sore mouth
dry, sore or itchy skin
diarrhoea or constipation
Many of these side effects can be treated or prevented and most, if not all, will pass after treatment stops."
Check if you have a chest infection,"Chest infections often follow colds or flu.
The main symptoms are:
a chesty cough – you may cough up green or yellow mucus
wheezing and shortness of breath
chest pain or discomfort
a high temperature
a headache
aching muscles
tiredness
These symptoms can be unpleasant, but they usually get better on their own in about 7 to 10 days.
The cough and mucus can last up to 3 weeks."
How to treat a chest infection yourself,"If you have a chest infection, there are things you can do to ease the symptoms.
Do
get plenty of rest
drink lots of water to loosen the mucus and make it easier to cough up
raise your head up while sleeping using extra pillows to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus
use painkillers to bring down a high temperature and ease headaches and muscle pain
drink a hot lemon and honey drink to relieve a sore throat
Don’t
do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water because of the risk of scalding
do not give aspirin to children under 16
do not smoke – it can make your symptoms worse
How to make a hot lemon and honey drink
A pharmacist can help with a chest infection
A pharmacist can recommend cough medicines to loosen the mucus in your lungs. This will make the mucus easier to cough up and help clear the infection from your lungs.
Cough medicines are not suitable for children under 6 years old.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment from a GP for a chest infection,"Treatment for a chest infection will depend on the cause.
A chest infection will either be caused by:
a virus (like viral bronchitis) – this usually clears up by itself after a few weeks and antibiotics will not help
bacteria (like pneumonia) – a GP may prescribe antibiotics (make sure you complete the whole course as advised by the GP, even if you start to feel better)
Antibiotics are only used to treat bacterial chest infections. They're not used for treating viral chest infections, like flu or viral bronchitis. This is because antibiotics do not work for viral infections.
You may need a blood test or a sample of your mucus may need to be tested to see what's causing your chest infection."
How to prevent chest infections,"How to avoid spreading chest infections
To avoid passing a chest infection on to others:
cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze
wash your hands regularly
throw away used tissues immediately
Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities.
How to avoid getting a chest infection
If you keep getting chest infections or you're at risk of getting one (for example, because you're over 65 or have a serious long-term health condition):
ask a GP about the annual flu vaccine
ask if you should have the pneumococcal vaccine – this helps prevent pneumonia
try to quit smoking if you smoke
cut down on how much alcohol you drink"
Common causes of chest pain,"Chest pain has many different causes. In most cases, chest pain is not caused by a heart problem.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of the cause. Do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Chest pain symptoms and possible causes
Chest pain symptoms Possible cause
Starts after eating, bringing up food or bitter tasting fluids, feeling full and bloated
Heartburn or indigestion
Starts after chest injury or chest exercise, may get worse when you breathe in, feels better when resting the muscle
Chest sprain or strain
An often sharp, continuous pain triggered by worries or a stressful situation, heartbeat gets faster, sweating, dizziness
Anxiety, depression or panic attack
Gets worse when you breathe in, coughing up yellow or green mucus, high temperature
Chest infection, pneumonia or pleurisy
Tingling feeling on skin, skin rash appears that turns into blisters
Shingles"
Chest pain and heart problems,"The most common heart problems that cause chest pain include:
pericarditis – which usually causes a sudden, sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or lie down
angina or a heart attack – which have similar symptoms but a heart attack is life-threatening
You're more likely to have heart problems if you're older or are at risk of coronary heart disease.
For example, you may be at risk of coronary heart disease if you:
smoke
are living with obesity
have high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol
have a history of heart attacks or angina in family members under 60 years old"
Are Chiari I malformations serious?,"The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally:
Chiari I malformations are not considered life-threatening
some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms but many people will not have any symptoms
there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly
surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain
Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need."
Symptoms of Chiari I malformations,"Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an MRI scan of the brain is carried out for another reason.
If symptoms do develop, they can include:
headaches – these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over
neck pain
dizziness and balance problems
muscle weakness
numbness or tingling in the arms or legs
blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light
swallowing problems
hearing loss and tinnitus
feeling and being sick
difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and clinical depression
If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control.
If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen."
Treatments for Chiari I malformations,"Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you do not have any symptoms.
Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain.
If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended.
Surgery
The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery.
Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine.
This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read more about decompression surgery for Chiari malformation:
Brain & Spine Foundation: Chiari malformation - information for adults
Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust: cranio-cervical decompression for Chiari malformation - information for children
Other procedures that may be necessary include:
Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) – a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunting – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.
Untethering – some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine.
Spinal fixation – some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine.
The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches.
However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke.
Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are."
Causes of Chiari I malformations,"The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done.
Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain.
Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour.
Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development.
But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms."
Information about you,"If you have been affected by a Chiari malformation, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Check if it's chickenpox,"An itchy, spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox. It can be anywhere on the body.
Chickenpox happens in 3 stages. But new spots can appear while others are becoming blisters or forming a scab.
Stage 1: small spots appear
The spots can:
be anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth and around the genitals, which can be painful
spread or stay in a small area
be red, pink, darker or the same colour as surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone
be harder to see on brown and black skin

Other symptoms
Before or after the rash appears, you might also get:
a high temperature
aches and pains, and generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite
Chickenpox is very itchy and can make children feel miserable, even if they do not have many spots.
The chickenpox spots look the same on children and adults. But adults usually have a high temperature for longer and more spots than children.
It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, but it's unusual."
How to treat chickenpox at home,"Important:
Stay off school or work
You'll need to stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have formed a scab. This is usually 5 days after the spots appeared.
Do
drink plenty of fluid (try ice lollies if your child is not drinking) to avoid dehydration
take paracetamol to help with pain and discomfort
cut your child's fingernails and put socks on their hands at night to stop them scratching
use cooling creams or gels from a pharmacy
speak to a pharmacist about using antihistamine medicine to help itching
bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (do not rub)
dress in loose clothes
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen unless advised to do so by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections
do not give aspirin to children under 16
do not go near newborn babies, or anyone who is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, as chickenpox can be dangerous for them
do not scratch the spots, as scratching can cause scarring"
It's easy to catch chickenpox,"You can catch chickenpox by being in the same room as someone with it. It's also spread by touching things that have fluid from the blisters on them.
When chickenpox can be spread
You can spread chickenpox to other people from 2 days before your spots appear until they have all formed scabs – usually 5 days after your spots appeared.
How soon you get symptoms after catching chickenpox
The spots start appearing around 1 to 3 weeks after you caught chickenpox."
Chickenpox in pregnancy,"Most people get chickenpox during childhood, so it's rare to get chickenpox when you're pregnant.
If you do get chickenpox when you're pregnant, there's a small risk of your baby being very ill when it's born.
Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111 if you have not had chickenpox before and you've been near someone with it."
The chickenpox vaccine,"You can get the chickenpox vaccine on the NHS if there's a risk of harming someone with a weakened immune system if you spread the virus to them.
For example, a child can be vaccinated if 1 of their parents is having chemotherapy.
You can also pay for the vaccine at some private clinics or travel clinics. It costs between £120 and £200."
Shingles and chickenpox,"You cannot catch shingles from someone with chickenpox.
You can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.
When you get chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. The virus can be triggered again if your immune system is weak. This causes shingles.
This can happen because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy."
Check if you have chilblains,"Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you've been in the cold.
You mostly get them on your fingers and toes. But you can also get them on your face and legs.
If you have chilblains, your skin can feel itchy or like it's burning.
Credit:
Your fingers or toes may become red, purple or swollen. The redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:"
What you can do about chilblains,"Chilblains usually go away on their own in 2 to 3 weeks.
There are some things you can try to get rid of them yourself and stop them coming back.
Do
try to avoid being outside when it's cold or damp – if you do go out, wear warm, waterproof clothing, gloves and thick socks
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain
Don’t
do not put your feet or hands on a radiator or under hot water to warm them up
do not smoke or have drinks that have caffeine in them – this can affect the flow of blood in your fingers and toes
do not scratch or pick at your skin
Information:
Some painkillers are not safe for everyone (for example, if you're pregnant). Always check the leaflet or get medical advice before taking them.
A pharmacist can help with chilblains
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
creams that can help to soothe the itching
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
What happens at your appointment,"A GP will check your symptoms to see if you have chilblains.
They may need to refer you for further tests with a specialist if they're not sure why you're getting chilblains.
Rarely, the GP will prescribe a medicine that can help your chilblains clear up."
Causes of chilblains,"You can get chilblains when it's cold. The cold makes the tiny blood vessels in your fingers and toes get smaller. This stops blood moving around as easily.
If you warm up too quickly, the blood vessels get bigger again and blood rushes to your fingers and toes. This can cause pain or swelling."
What the dentist will do,"Treatments for a chipped, broken or cracked tooth include:
gluing the fragment of tooth back on
a filling or a crown (a cap that completely covers the broken tooth)
root canal treatment for a badly broken tooth where the nerves are exposed
Read more about dental treatments"
Uses of chiropractic,"Chiropractic can mainly help with pain in muscles and joints, such as:
back pain
neck pain
shoulder pain
elbow pain
pain from osteoarthritis
There's little evidence that it can help with more serious conditions or problems not affecting the muscles or joints, such as asthma, allergies and mental health problems."
Getting chiropractic on the NHS,"Chiropractic is not widely available on the NHS, but it may be offered in exceptional circumstances in some areas.
To find out if you can see a chiropractor on the NHS in your area:
ask a GP
contact your local integrated care board (ICB)
If you need hands-on treatment, a GP is more likely to refer you to a physiotherapist."
Paying for private chiropractic treatment,"Most people who have chiropractic treatment pay for it privately. It usually costs around £50 to £100 for a first session to assess your problem and plan your treatment, and then £30 to £50 per session.
You do not need to see a GP before making an appointment, but it's best to speak to them for advice first. They can let you know about other treatments that might help, and can advise you if chiropractic is suitable for you.
If you decide to contact a chiropractor yourself, make sure they're registered with the General Chiropractic Council (GCC). By law, all chiropractors must be registered with the GCC.
You can look out for chiropractors displaying the GCC ""I'm Registered"" mark or find a registered chiropractor on the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) website."
What happens during chiropractic treatment,"At your first appointment, the chiropractor will assess your symptoms to determine if chiropractic is suitable and what techniques are likely to help.
Chiropractors use different techniques to treat problems with the muscles and joints, including:
spinal manipulation – using their hands to apply force to the muscles, bones and joints of the spine and neck
short, sharp thrusting movements
gradually moving your joints into different positions
pulling or stretching your muscles in different directions
Treatment is not normally painful, but some people experience a bit of discomfort. Tell your chiropractor immediately if you find it painful."
Risks and side effects of chiropractic,"Chiropractic is generally safe when performed correctly by a trained and registered chiropractor.
Some people may experience side effects from treatment, such as:
aches and pains
stiffness
tiredness
These side effects are usually mild and pass in a few days.
There is a risk of more serious problems, such as stroke, from spinal manipulation.
Speak to a GP if you're unsure whether chiropractic is safe for you."
Symptoms of chlamydia,"Most people with chlamydia do not notice any symptoms and do not know they have it.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:
pain when peeing
unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or bottom
in women, pain in the tummy, bleeding after sex and bleeding between periods
in men, pain and swelling in the testicles
If you think you're at risk of having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or have any symptoms of chlamydia, visit a GP, community contraceptive service or local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic to get tested."
How do you get chlamydia?,"Chlamydia is a bacterial infection. The bacteria are usually spread through sex or contact with infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid).
You can get chlamydia through:
unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex
sharing sex toys that are not washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used
your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals – this means you can get chlamydia from someone even if there's no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation
infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye
It can also be passed by a pregnant woman to her baby.
Chlamydia cannot be passed on through casual contact, such as kissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery."
Is chlamydia serious?,"Although chlamydia does not usually cause any symptoms and can normally be treated with a short course of antibiotics, it can be serious if it's not treated early on.
If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your body and lead to long-term health problems, especially in women.
In women, untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and infertility.
In men, in rare cases, chlamydia can spread to the testicles and epididymis (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles), causing them to become painful and swollen. This is known as epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the testicles).
It can also sometimes cause reactive arthritis in men and women.
This is why it's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you think you might have chlamydia.
Find out more about the complications of chlamydia"
Getting tested for chlamydia,"Testing for chlamydia is done with a urine test or a swab test.
You do not always need a physical examination by a nurse or doctor.
Anyone can get a free and confidential chlamydia test at a sexual health clinic, a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or a GP surgery.
In England, if you're a woman under 25 years old, you may be offered a chlamydia test when you visit some health services, for example a pharmacy or GP. This offer is part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP).
If you're offered a chlamydia test you should consider taking it.
If you're a woman, sexually active and under 25 in England, it's recommended that you have a chlamydia test once a year, and when you have sex with new or casual partners.
If you're a man, sexually active and under 25 in England, it's recommended that you have a chlamydia test once a year if you are not using condoms with new or casual partners.
You can also buy chlamydia testing kits to do at home.

How chlamydia is treated,"Chlamydia can usually be treated easily with antibiotics.
You may be given a course of doxycycline to take for a week or azithromycin to take once a day for 3 days.
If you have doxycycline, you should not have sex (including oral sex) until you and your current sexual partner have finished treatment.
If you have azithromycin, you should wait 7 days after treatment before having sex (including oral sex).
It's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent sexual partners you have had are also tested and treated to help stop the spread of the infection.
Under-25s who have chlamydia should be offered another test 3 to 6 months after being treated.
This is because young adults who test positive for chlamydia are at increased risk of catching it again.
Sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics can help you contact your sexual partners.
Either you or the clinic can speak to them, or they can be sent a note advising them to get tested.
The note will not have your name on it, so your confidentiality will be protected."
Preventing chlamydia,"Anyone who's sexually active can catch chlamydia.
You're most at risk if you have a new sexual partner or do not use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, when having sex.
You can help to prevent the spread of chlamydia by:
using a condom every time you have vaginal or anal sex
using a condom to cover the penis during oral sex
using a dam (a piece of thin, soft plastic or latex) to cover the female genitals during oral sex or when rubbing female genitals together
not sharing sex toys
If you do share sex toys, wash them or cover them with a new condom between each person who uses them."
Common questions,"Find answers to some common questions about chlamydia:
How soon do STI symptoms appear?
What should I do if I think I've got an STI?
Are sex toys safe?
What services do sexual health clinics (GUM clinics) provide?"
Check if you could be at risk of cholera,"You can catch cholera from:
drinking unclean water
eating food (particularly shellfish) that's been in unclean water
eating food that's been handled by an infected person
The risk of getting it while travelling is very small.
It's mainly found in places without a clean water supply or modern sewage system, such as parts of Africa and Asia.
Information:
You can check the country information on the TravelHealthPro website"
How to avoid cholera while travelling,"Good hygiene can help stop you getting ill while travelling in areas where cholera is found.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water regularly, especially after using the toilet and before preparing food or eating
only drink tap water that's been boiled or bottled water
brush your teeth using bottled or boiled water
Don’t
do not eat uncooked fruit and vegetables (including salads) that you have not washed with bottled or boiled water and prepared yourself
do not eat shellfish and seafood
do not eat ice cream or have ice in your drinks"
You can get vaccinated against cholera if you're at risk,"There's a vaccine for cholera, but most people do not need it.
It's usually only recommended if either:
you're travelling to an area where cholera is common and you'll be visiting remote places without access to medical care
you're an aid or disaster relief worker going to an area where a cholera outbreak is likely
The vaccine is given as a drink. For adults, 2 doses (given 1 to 6 weeks apart) can provide protection for up to 2 years.
You need to have had both doses at least a week before travelling.
Information:
If you need the cholera vaccine, you may be able to get it for free on the NHS. Ask at your GP surgery."
Symptoms of cholesteatoma,"A cholesteatoma usually only affects 1 ear. The 2 most common symptoms are:
a persistent or recurring watery, often smelly, discharge from the ear, which can come and go or may be continuous
a gradual loss of hearing in the affected ear
Some people may experience slight discomfort in their ear."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have problems with your hearing or a watery discharge from your ear.
The GP may examine your ear with an otoscope – an instrument with a light and magnifying glass.
They may suspect a cholesteatoma from your symptoms, but it can be difficult to confirm because a build-up of pus inside the ear often blocks it from view.
If the GP thinks your symptoms could just be an ear infection, they may offer you treatment for this first and ask to see you again once you've completed it.
If they think you have a cholesteatoma, they should refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests.
This may include a CT scan to see whether the cholesteatoma has spread and which parts of your ear are affected."
Treating a cholesteatoma,"Surgery
To remove a cholesteatoma, you usually need to have surgery under general anaesthetic.
After the cholesteatoma has been taken out, your ear may be packed with a dressing. This will need to be removed a few weeks later, and you'll be told how to look after it.
As well as removing the cholesteatoma, the surgeon may be able to improve your hearing. This can be done in a number of ways.
For example, a tiny artificial hearing bone (prosthesis) can be inserted to bridge the gap between your eardrum and the cochlea (hearing organ). In some cases, it may not be possible to reconstruct the hearing or a further operation may be needed.
The benefits of removing a cholesteatoma usually far outweigh the complications. However, as with any type of surgery, there's a small risk associated with having anaesthetic, and a very small chance of facial nerve damage resulting in weakness of the side of the face.
Discuss the risks with your surgeon before having the operation."
Recovering from surgery,"You may need to stay in hospital overnight after the operation, and you should plan to take a week or so off work.
When you get home, you'll need to keep the affected ear dry. You should be able to wash your hair after a week, provided you do not get water inside the ear. To avoid this, you can plug the ear with Vaseline-coated cotton wool.
You may be advised to avoid flying, swimming and doing strenuous activities or sports for a few weeks after surgery. At your follow-up appointment, ask when it will be safe to return to your usual activities.
Follow-up appointments
If your stitches are not dissolvable, they may need to be removed by your practice nurse after a week or 2.
Most people have a follow-up appointment in a clinic within a few weeks of the operation, when any dressings in your ear will be removed.
A cholesteatoma can come back, and you could get one in your other ear, so you'll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor this. 
Sometimes a second operation is needed after about a year to check for any skin cells left behind. However, MRI scans are now often used instead of surgery to check for this.
When to get medical advice after surgery
Contact a GP or your hospital ENT department if you have:
discharge or significant bleeding from your ear or wound
a high temperature
severe or increasing pain
These symptoms could be a sign of a complication, such as an infection."
Cause of a cholesteatoma,"A cholesteatoma can develop if part of the eardrum collapses.
Dead skin cells are normally passed out of the ear, but if the eardrum collapses, it may create a pocket where the dead skin cells can collect.
You can get a cholesteatoma if the eardrum is damaged through an injury or infection, or after any kind of ear surgery.
You can also be born with a cholesteatoma, but this is rare."
When CVS is offered,"CVS is not routinely offered in pregnancy.
It's only offered if there's a high chance your baby could have a genetic or chromosomal condition.
This could be because:
an antenatal screening test has suggested your baby may be born with a condition, such as Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome
you had a previous pregnancy affected by a genetic condition
you have a family history of a genetic condition, such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
It's important to remember that you do not have to have CVS if it's offered. It's up to you to decide whether you want it.
A midwife or doctor will speak to you about what the test involves, and let you know what the possible benefits are, to help you make a decision.
Find out more about why CVS is offered and deciding whether to have it"
How CVS is performed,"CVS is usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it's sometimes performed later than this if necessary.
During the test, a small sample of cells is removed from the placenta using 1 of 2 methods:
transabdominal CVS – a needle is inserted through your tummy (this is the most common method used)
transcervical CVS – a tube or small forceps (smooth metal instruments that look like tongs) are inserted through the cervix (the neck of the womb)
The test itself takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes.
The CVS procedure is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful, although you may experience some cramps that are similar to period pains for a few hours afterwards.
Find out more about what happens during CVS"
Getting your results,"The first results of the test should be available in about 3 days. This is known as the rapid CVS result.
A more detailed set of CVS results will be available after 2 weeks.
If the rapid CVS result and a previous ultrasound scan both indicate your baby has a condition, your doctor will discuss your options with you straightaway.
If your previous ultrasound did not find anything unexpected, it’s recommended you wait until the more detailed set of CVS results before making a decision about ending your pregnancy.
If the results of these tests suggest it is highly likely your baby has a genetic condition, a specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.
There's no cure for most of the conditions found by CVS, so you'll need to consider your options carefully.
You may decide to continue with your pregnancy while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared.
Find out more about having a baby that might be born with a genetic condition
Or you may consider ending your pregnancy (having a termination).
Find out more about the results of CVS"
Miscarriage and infections.,"Before you decide to have CVS, the possible complications will be discussed with you.
CVS can cause miscarriage, the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks. The chance of miscarrying after CVS is thought to be less than 1 in 200 for most pregnancies, and at around 1 in 100 for multiple pregnancies (such as twins).
You might also get an infection, or need to have CVS again because it was not successful the first time.
Read more about the complications of CVS"
What are the alternatives?,"An alternative to CVS is a test called amniocentesis.
This is where a small sample of amniotic fluid, the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb, is removed for testing.
It's usually carried out between the 15th and 18th week of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary.
This test can also cause a miscarriage, but your pregnancy will be at a more advanced stage before you can get the results, so you'll have less time to consider your options.
If you're offered tests to look for a genetic or chromosomal condition in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you and help you make a decision."
Symptoms of ME/CFS,"Common symptoms of ME/CFS include
feeling extremely tired all the time – you may find it very hard to do daily activities
still feeling tired after resting or sleeping
taking a long time to recover after physical activity
problems sleeping, such as waking up often during the night
problems with thinking, memory and concentration
Some people with ME/CFS may also have other symptoms, including:
muscle or joint pain
headaches
a sore throat
flu-like symptoms
feeling dizzy or sick
fast or irregular heartbeats (heart palpitations)
The severity of symptoms can vary from day to day, or even within a day.
The symptoms of ME/CFS are similar to the symptoms of some other illnesses, so it's important to see a GP to get a correct diagnosis."
Diagnosing ME/CFS,"There is not a specific test for ME/CFS, so it's diagnosed based on your symptoms and by ruling out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
The GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may also have blood and urine tests.
As the symptoms of ME/CFS are similar to those of many common illnesses that usually get better on their own, a diagnosis of ME/CFS may be considered if you do not get better as quickly as expected.
Find out more about diagnosing ME/CFS"
Treating ME/CFS,"Treatment for ME/CFS aims to relieve the symptoms. Your treatment will depend on how the condition is affecting you
While there is currently no cure for ME/CFS, there are treatments that may help you manage the condition.
Treatments include:
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
energy management – where you're given advice about how to make best use of the energy you have without making your symptoms worse
medicine to control symptoms such as pain and sleeping problems
Some people with ME/CFS will improve over time, especially with treatment.
Many people with ME/CFS will need to adapt their daily routine and pattern of activities on a long-term basis. There may be periods when your symptoms get better or worse."
Causes of ME/CFS,"It's not known what causes ME/CFS, but there are a number of theories – for example, it may be triggered by an infection, or certain factors could make you more likely to develop the illness.
Suggested causes or triggers for ME/CFS include:
viral infections, such as glandular fever
bacterial infections, such as pneumonia
problems with the immune system
a hormone imbalance
your genes – ME/CFS seems to be more common in some families"
Living with ME/CFS,"Living with ME/CFS can be difficult. Extreme tiredness and other physical symptoms can make it hard to carry out everyday activities. You may have to make some major lifestyle changes.
ME/CFS can also affect your mental and emotional health, and have a negative effect on your self-esteem.
As well as asking your family and friends for support, you may find it useful to talk to other people with ME/CFS.
ME Association is a charity that provides information, support and practical advice for people affected by the condition.
You can find a local support group on the ME Association website

Symptoms of CKD,"There are usually no symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. It may only be diagnosed if you have a blood or urine test for another reason and the results show a possible problem with your kidneys.
At a more advanced stage, symptoms can include:
tiredness
swollen ankles, feet or hands
shortness of breath
feeling sick
blood in your pee (urine)
See a GP if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease.
Find out more about the symptoms of CKD."
Causes of CKD,"Chronic kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems.
CKD can be caused by:
high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
kidney infections
glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from kidney stones that keep coming back, or an enlarged prostate
long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled."
Tests for CKD,"CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys are not working properly.
If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease (for example, you have a known risk factor such as high blood pressure or diabetes), you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's found at an early stage.
The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD.
Find out more about how CKD is diagnosed."
Treatments for CKD,"There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse.
Your treatment will depend on how severe your condition is.
The main treatments are:
lifestyle changes to help you remain as healthy as possible
medicine to control associated problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol
dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions; this may be necessary in advanced CKD
kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced CKD
You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition.
Find out more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD."
Outlook for CKD,"CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure.
Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medicine and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 2 in 100 people with the condition.
If you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease. This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attack and stroke.
Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce your risk of developing it.

Symptoms of COPD,"The main symptoms of COPD are:
shortness of breath, particularly when you're active
a persistent chesty cough with phlegm – some people may dismiss this as just a ""smoker's cough""
frequent chest infections
persistent wheezing
Without treatment, the symptoms usually get progressively worse. There may also be periods when they get suddenly worse, known as a flare-up or exacerbation.
Find out more about the symptoms of COPD."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have persistent symptoms of COPD, particularly if you're over 35 and smoke or used to smoke.
Do not ignore the symptoms. If they're caused by COPD, it's best to start treatment as soon as possible, before your lungs become significantly damaged.
The GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you smoke or have smoked in the past. They can organise a breathing test to help diagnose COPD and rule out other lung conditions, such as asthma.
Find out more about how COPD is diagnosed."
Causes of COPD,"COPD happens when the lungs become inflamed, damaged and narrowed. The main cause is smoking, although the condition can sometimes affect people who have never smoked.
The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've smoked.
Some cases of COPD are caused by long-term exposure to harmful fumes or dust. Others are the result of a rare genetic problem that makes the lungs more vulnerable to damage.
Find out more about the causes of COPD."
Treatments for COPD,"The damage to the lungs caused by COPD is permanent, but treatment can help slow down the progression of the condition.
Treatments include:
stopping smoking – if you have COPD and you smoke, this is the most important thing you can do
inhalers and medicines – to help make breathing easier
pulmonary rehabilitation – a specialised programme of exercise and education
surgery or a lung transplant – although this is only an option for a very small number of people
Find out more about how COPD is treated and living with COPD."
Outlook for COPD,"The outlook for COPD varies from person to person. The condition cannot be cured or reversed, but for many people, treatment can help keep it under control so it does not severely limit their daily activities.
But in some people, COPD may continue to get worse despite treatment, eventually having a significant impact on their quality of life and leading to life-threatening problems.

Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis,"The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of severe pain in your tummy (abdomen).
The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of your tummy and can move along your back.
It's been described as a burning or shooting pain that comes and goes, but may last for several hours or days.
Although the pain sometimes comes on after eating a meal, there's often no trigger. Some people might feel sick and vomit.
As the condition progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.
Eventually, a constant dull pain can develop in your tummy, between episodes of severe pain.
This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.
Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may find the pain is less severe."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP immediately if you're experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong.
If this is not possible, contact NHS 111 for advice.
You should also see a GP as soon as you can if:
your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow (jaundice)
you keep being sick
Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it's usually a sign there's something wrong with your digestive system."
Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis,"A GP will ask about your symptoms and may examine you.
They'll refer you to a specialist for further tests if they think you have chronic pancreatitis.
The specialist will be able to confirm whether you have the condition.
Tests
Tests and scans are usually carried out in your local hospital.
They may include:
an ultrasound scan – where sound waves are used to create a picture of your pancreas
a CT scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed 3D image of your pancreas
an endoscopic ultrasound scan – where a long, thin tube containing a camera is passed through your mouth and down into your stomach to take pictures of your pancreas
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) – a type of MRI scan that takes a detailed image of your pancreas and the organs around it
Biopsy
Sometimes the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to pancreatic cancer.
You may need a biopsy, where a small sample of cells is taken from the pancreas and sent to a laboratory to be checked, to rule this out."
Causes of chronic pancreatitis,"The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years.
This can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, which results in increasing damage to the organ.
Find out more about alcohol misuse
In children the most common cause is cystic fibrosis.
Less common causes include:
smoking
the immune system attacking the pancreas (autoimmune chronic pancreatitis)
inheriting a faulty gene that stops the pancreas working properly
injury to the pancreas
gallstones blocking the openings (ducts) of the pancreas
radiotherapy to the tummy
In some cases, no cause can be identified. This is called idiopathic chronic pancreatitis."
Treatment for chronic pancreatitis,"The damage to the pancreas is permanent, but treatment can help control the condition and manage any symptoms.
People with chronic pancreatitis are usually advised to make lifestyle changes, such as stopping drinking alcohol and stopping smoking. They're also given medicine to relieve pain.
Surgery may also be an option for those experiencing severe pain."
Complications,"Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain.
See a GP if you're experiencing stress, anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis.
Some people with chronic pancreatitis will eventually develop a type of diabetes known as type 3c diabetes.
This occurs when the pancreas can no longer produce insulin because it's become so damaged.
People with chronic pancreatitis can sometimes develop sacs of fluid on the surface of their pancreas (pseudocysts). These can cause bloating, indigestion and dull tummy pain.
These cysts often disappear on their own. But sometimes they need to be drained using a technique called endoscopic ultrasound drainage, or endoscopic transpapillary drainage.
Chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of pancreatic cancer, although the chance is still small."
Support for people living with chronic pancreatitis,"Any long-term health condition, particularly one that causes recurring episodes of pain or constant pain, can affect your emotional and psychological health.
See a GP if you're experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. There are medicines available that can help with stress, anxiety and depression.
Talking to other people with the same condition can often reduce feelings of isolation and stress.
The charity Guts UK, may be able to put you in touch with a local support group."
Check if you have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),"Early symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy may not be noticeable at first.
They may include:
mood changes, such as depression or suicidal thoughts
personality changes
behaviour changes, such as aggression and mood swings
As the condition gets worse, you'll have more noticeable problems with thinking and memory.
Symptoms include:
short-term memory loss
confusion, such as getting lost or not knowing what time of day it is
difficulties with planning and organisation
problems with movement
Symptoms usually start gradually, often around 10 years after having repeated head injuries.
The symptoms may get worse gradually or stay the same for years before getting worse."
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a GP will ask you about your symptoms and if you've played a lot of contact sports in the past or have had several head injuries or concussions.
They may also:
ask you to do simple tasks such as moving or walking around
do tests to check your memory and thinking
arrange blood or urine tests to check for other conditions that could be causing your symptoms
You may be referred to a specialist at a memory assessment service. These clinics help diagnose and care for people with dementia.
But you may not be formally diagnosed with CTE as this can only be done once you've died."
Causes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),"If you've had repeated blows to the head or concussions over many years, you may have a higher chance of getting chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
You're most at risk if you:
regularly played contact sports, such as boxing, martial arts, football, rugby and American football
served in the military and have had blast injuries
have been physically assaulted often, such as from domestic violence
Anyone who's had repeated head injuries is at risk, but not everyone will get it.
It's thought the only way to lower your risk of getting CTE is to avoid repeated head injuries.
For example, you can do this by wearing the correct protective equipment for any sports you play and making sure head injuries are treated properly."
Treatments for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) cannot be cured, but medicines and other treatments can help your symptoms.
If it's thought you have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the support you'll have is similar to the help given to people with dementia.
For example:
physiotherapy if you have difficulties with movement
occupational therapy for help with things like getting dressed or adapting your home to your needs
speech and language therapy for help with things like memory, speech, and difficulty eating and drinking
You'll be seen by a group of specialists, including a GP, a dementia care specialist and social care services.
The specialists involved in your care will work together to give you a care plan for your long-term care."
Medical reasons for a boy to have a circumcision,"It's rare for circumcision to be recommended for medical reasons in boys. This is because other less invasive and less risky treatments are usually available.
The following conditions affect the penis and, in rare cases, may require a circumcision:
Tight foreskin (phimosis) – where the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head of the penis. This can sometimes cause pain when the penis is erect and, in rare cases, passing urine may be difficult.
Recurrent infection (balanitis) – where the foreskin and head of the penis become inflamed and infected.
Paraphimosis – where the foreskin cannot be returned to its original position after being pulled back, causing the head of the penis to become swollen and painful. Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications, such as restricted blood flow to the penis.
Balanitis xerotica obliterans – a condition that causes a tight foreskin and, in some cases, also affects the head of the penis, which can become scarred and inflamed.
Read more about circumcision in adult men for medical reasons"
How the foreskin develops,"It's normal for a baby boy's foreskin not to pull back (retract) for the first few years of life.
Around the age of 3 – or later, in some cases – the foreskin should start to separate naturally from the head of the penis (glans). Most boys’ foreskins do not pull back (retract) before the age of 5, but sometimes it’s not possible until they’re 10 or older.
For some boys, the foreskin can take longer to separate, but this does not mean there's a problem and it will usually just detach at a later stage.
As the foreskin starts to separate from the head of the penis, you may see the foreskin ""ballooning out"" when your son passes urine. This can occasionally lead to infection (balanitis), but this ballooning usually settles down with time.
Never try to force your son's foreskin back, as it may be painful and damage the foreskin."
The procedure,"Circumcision is usually carried out on a day patient basis. This means your child will be admitted to hospital on the same day he has surgery and will not need to stay overnight.
He will not be able to eat or drink before having surgery – you'll receive detailed information about this in a letter.
After being admitted to hospital, your child will be seen by the surgeon who will carry out the procedure. They'll explain the operation in more detail, discuss any concerns and answer any questions you have.
They'll also ask you to sign a consent form, giving your permission for the operation.
The anaesthetist will also visit your child before the operation. Your son will usually have a general anaesthetic, so he'll be asleep throughout the procedure and unable to feel any pain or discomfort.
Circumcision is a relatively simple procedure. The foreskin is removed just behind the head of the penis using a scalpel or surgical scissors.
Any bleeding can be stopped using heat (cauterised). The remaining edges of skin are stitched together using dissolvable stitches. It will take up to 6 weeks for your son's penis to fully heal."
Recovering after male circumcision,"After the operation, a dressing will be put over the penis to protect the wound. It may be removed before your child goes home, or it may be left. If it is left it should fall off itself within 24 hours.
He will be allowed home after he's passed urine, which may be uncomfortable at first.
The penis will be sore and inflamed for a few days after the operation. Ointment may be prescribed to use for a few days to help the area heal. 
Your child will also need regular pain relief for at least 3 days. They can take paracetamol or ibuprofen following the instructions on the packet.
Your child will be able to have a bath the day after their operation. They should avoid riding a bicycle or other toys they sit on until any swelling has gone down.
It may be more comfortable to wear loose clothing – or no clothing at all – on his bottom half for a few days after the operation. Passing urine while in the bath or shower may also be more comfortable.
He should be able to return to school or nursery about a week after the operation. Make sure you tell the school or nursery about the operation.
In most cases, a follow-up appointment will not be necessary.
However, you should contact your GP or hospital care team if:
your child's penis is bleeding
your child's penis is still swollen 2 weeks after the operation
passing urine is still painful a few days after the operation"
Risks of male circumcision,"The risks associated with circumcisions when carried out by qualified and experienced doctors are small.
The main risk is bleeding, both during and after the operation. The surgeon will seal off any bleeding during the procedure, and the dressing applied afterwards will absorb any further bleeding.
However, seek medical advice if your child's penis continues to bleed after they return home.
Other possible complications include pain, infection of the wound and scarring."
Why circumcision is carried out in men,"Circumcision may be carried out for a number of reasons.
Medical reasons
In men, circumcision is most commonly carried out when the foreskin is tight and won't pull back (retract), which is known as phimosis.
But alternative treatments, such as topical steroids, are sometimes preferred.
Non-medical reasons
Circumcision is a common practice in the Jewish and Islamic communities, and it's also practised by many African communities.
Most non-medical circumcisions are carried out on children."
Medical reasons for men to have a circumcision,"In men, circumcision is sometimes considered a possible treatment option for the following conditions.
Tight foreskin (phimosis)
Phimosis is where the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head of the penis (glans).
This can sometimes cause pain when the penis is erect and, in rare cases, passing urine may be difficult.
Recurrent balanitis
Balanitis is where the foreskin and head of the penis become inflamed and infected.
Paraphimosis
Paraphimosis is where the foreskin can't be returned to its original position after being pulled back, causing the head of the penis to become swollen and painful. It's a possible complication of a tight foreskin (phimosis).
Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications, such as restricted blood flow to the penis.
Balanitis xerotica obliterans
This condition causes phimosis and, in some cases, also affects the head of the penis, which can become scarred and inflamed.
Cancer of the penis
Cancer of the penis (penile cancer) is a very rare type of cancer, where a wart-like growth or ulcer appears on the end of the penis or under the foreskin, or there is bleeding, discharge or changes in the skin of the penis or foreskin.
Other treatments
In most cases, circumcision will only be recommended when other, less invasive and less risky treatments have been tried and haven't worked.
Mild cases of phimosis can be treated with topical steroids to help soften the skin and make it easier for the foreskin to retract.
In paraphimosis, a healthcare professional may rub a local anaesthetic gel onto the glans to help reduce pain and inflammation.
They may then apply pressure to the head of the penis while pushing the foreskin forward.
In severe cases of paraphimosis, local anaesthetic gel can be applied to the penis and a small slit is made in the foreskin to help relieve the pressure.
Balanitis and balanitis xerotica obliterans can sometimes be successfully treated using corticosteroid ointment, gel or cream, antibiotic creams or antifungal creams.
The 3 main treatment options for penile cancer are:
surgery to remove the cancerous cells, and sometimes the surrounding tissue
radiotherapy
chemotherapy
If you're considering circumcision for a medical reason, it's worth discussing alternative treatment options with your GP or specialist."
HIV prevention,"There's evidence from several trials carried out in Africa that circumcised men have a lower risk of acquiring HIV.
But it's unclear whether circumcision can help prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
There have been several studies into circumcision and the risk of other STIs, but the evidence to date has been inconclusive and conflicting."
The procedure,"Circumcision is usually carried out on a day patient basis. This means you'll be admitted to hospital on the same day you have surgery and won't have to stay overnight.
You'll be asked not to eat and drink for 6 hours before surgery if you're having a general anaesthetic.
After you have been admitted to hospital, you'll be seen by the members of the medical team carrying out the procedure, including your surgeon and anaesthetist.
This is a good opportunity to discuss any concerns you have and ask questions about anything you're not sure about.
You'll be asked to sign a consent form to confirm you agree to the surgery.
You'll usually either have a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious throughout the procedure, or a local anaesthetic injection, which will numb your penis and the surrounding area.
In some cases, a spinal anaesthetic, where you're unable to feel anything below your waist, will be used.
Read more about the different types of anaesthesia
Circumcision is a relatively simple procedure. The foreskin is removed just behind the head of the penis using a scalpel or surgical scissors.
Any bleeding can be stopped using heat (cauterisation), and the remaining edges of skin will be stitched together using dissolvable stitches.
The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) has produced a leaflet that outlines the circumcision procedure in more detail"
Recovering after circumcision,"When you're discharged from hospital, you'll be given advice about your recovery at home, including when you can drive, return to work and have sex.
It usually takes at least 10 days for your penis to heal after circumcision.
You'll probably be advised to take at least 1 week off work to recover.
You don't need to tell the DVLA if you have had a routine circumcision and don't have any other medical conditions that affect your ability to drive.
But it's your responsibility to ensure you're fit to drive after having surgery.
You should avoid having sex for at least 4 weeks after your operation.
Your care team will give you a contact number to call in case you experience any problems or have any concerns.
You should also be given details about your follow-up appointment, which may be at the hospital or with your GP.
For 3 or 4 days after your operation, it's likely you'll experience some discomfort and swelling around the head of your penis.
Before leaving hospital, you'll be given painkilling medicine, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help ease this.
But contact your GP if you have a temperature, increased redness, bleeding, persistent pain or throbbing of your penis, as it could be a sign of infection.
Applying petroleum jelly (Vaseline) around the tip of your penis will stop it sticking to your underwear.
Wearing light, loose-fitting clothing for 2 or 3 days after your operation will also help avoid irritation to your penis while it heals.
You may feel some discomfort while passing urine, but contact your GP if painkillers don't help or if the pain is getting worse.
If you are finding it hard to pee, you should contact your GP."
Risks of circumcision,"In the UK, complications after circumcisions carried out for medical reasons are rare and most men don't experience any significant problems.
Apart from the initial swelling, bleeding and infection are the 2 most common problems associated with circumcision.
Other possible complications of circumcision can include:
permanent reduction in sensation in the head of the penis, particularly during sex
tenderness around the scar
the need to remove stitches that haven't dissolved
occasionally, another operation is needed to remove some more skin from around the head of the penis"
Symptoms of cirrhosis,"You may not have any symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis.
As your liver becomes more damaged, you may:
feel very tired and weak
feel sick (nausea)
lose your appetite
lose weight and muscle mass
get red patches on your palms and small, spider-like blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas) above waist level
If cirrhosis gets worse, some of the symptoms and complications include:
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
vomiting blood
itchy skin
dark pee and tarry-looking poo
bleeding or bruising easily
swollen legs (oedema) or tummy (ascites) from a build-up of fluid
loss of sex drive (libido)
See a GP if you think you may have cirrhosis."
Diagnosing cirrhosis,"If a GP suspects cirrhosis, they'll check your medical history and do a physical examination to look for signs of long-term liver disease.
You may have tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as:
blood tests
scans, such as an ultrasound, CT, MRI, or transient elastography scan
a liver biopsy, where a fine needle is used to remove a sample of liver cells so they can be examined under a microscope
If tests show that you have cirrhosis, a GP should refer you to see a doctor who specialises in liver problems (hepatologist).
If you have complications from cirrhosis, or a high chance of getting complications, you may be referred to a specialist liver centre."
Treating cirrhosis,"There's no cure for cirrhosis at the moment. However, there are ways to manage the symptoms and any complications and slow its progression.
Treating the problem that led to cirrhosis (for example, using anti-viral medicines to treat hepatitis C) can stop cirrhosis getting worse.
You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you're overweight. 
A GP can help you get support if you need help to stop drinking or to lose weight.
If your liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be the only treatment option."
What causes cirrhosis,"In the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are:
drinking too much alcohol over many years
being infected with hepatitis for a long time, particularly hepatitis B or hepatitis C
a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, where the liver becomes inflamed from a build-up of excess fat
Cirrhosis can also be caused by a problem affecting your bile ducts (such as primary biliary cholangitis) or immune system (such as autoimmune hepatitis), some inherited conditions, and the long-term use of certain medicines.
Alcohol-related liver disease
Drinking too much alcohol damages the liver. Over time, this can lead to alcohol-related liver disease.
Cirrhosis is the final stage of alcohol-related liver disease. It usually happens after many years of heavy drinking."
How to prevent cirrhosis,"Limit alcohol
The best way to prevent alcohol-related cirrhosis is to drink within the recommended limits.
The guidelines recommend:
men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week
you should spread your drinking over 3 days, or more, if you drink as much as 14 units a week
Stop drinking alcohol immediately if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis. Drinking alcohol speeds up the rate at which cirrhosis progresses, regardless of the cause.
A GP can offer help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink. 
Read more about where to get alcohol support.
Protect yourself from hepatitis
Hepatitis B and C are infections in the liver caused by a virus.
The hepatitis B virus is spread in blood and body fluids. The hepatitis C virus is usually spread in blood.
Common ways of spreading these viruses include having sex with an infected person without using a condom, or close contact with an infected person's blood, such as sharing their toothbrush or sharing needles to inject drugs.
Vaccination for hepatitis B is part of the NHS childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is also available to anyone who has an increased chance of getting hepatitis B.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C at the moment.
Aim for a healthy weight
To reduce your chance of getting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to cirrhosis, make sure you're a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly."
The liver,"The liver is an important organ that does hundreds of jobs that are vital for sustaining life.
For example, the liver:
stores glycogen, a type of fuel the body needs for energy
makes bile, which helps us digest fats
makes substances that help blood to clot and repair damaged tissues
processes and removes alcohol, toxins or medicines from the blood
helps the body fight infections
Your liver is very tough. It'll keep working even when it's damaged and can continue to repair itself until it's severely damaged."
Symptoms of CJD,"Symptoms of CJD include:
loss of intellect and memory
changes in personality
loss of balance and co-ordination
slurred speech
vision problems and blindness
abnormal jerking movements
progressive loss of brain function and mobility
Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
What causes CJD?,"CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
Types of CJD,"There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985."
How CJD is treated,"There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.
Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
Variant CJD compensation scheme,"In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.
The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families."
Triggers of claustrophobia,"Many different situations or feelings can trigger claustrophobia. Even thinking about certain situations without exposure to them could be a trigger.
Common triggers of claustrophobia include:
lifts
tunnels
tube trains
public toilets
rooms where the doors have to be locked
cars
hotel rooms with sealed windows
planes
If you have felt anxious in the last 6 months about being in a confined space or crowded place, or you have avoided these situations for this reason, it's likely that you're affected by claustrophobia.
MRI scan anxiety
If you have claustrophobia and need to have an MRI scan, let the staff at the hospital know before the day of your appointment.
You can talk to your consultant about having a sedative to help you relax. You should do this well in advance of having the scan.
In some cases, you may be able to attend an open or upright MRI centre, designed for people with severe MRI anxiety. But these clinics are often only available privately."
Symptoms of claustrophobia,"People with claustrophobia can have panic attacks. They can be very frightening and distressing.
As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, claustrophobia can also cause physical symptoms, such as:
sweating
trembling
hot flushes or chills
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
a choking sensation
a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest
a sensation of butterflies in the stomach
feeling sick
headaches and dizziness
feeling faint
numbness or pins and needles
a dry mouth
a need to go to the toilet
ringing in your ears
feeling confused or disorientated
If you have severe claustrophobia, you may also experience psychological symptoms, such as:
fear of losing control
fear of fainting
feelings of being detached from your body
fear of dying"
What causes claustrophobia?,"Claustrophobia is often caused by a traumatic event experienced during early childhood.
For example, adults may develop claustrophobia if, as a child, they:
were trapped or kept in a confined space
were bullied or abused
had a parent with claustrophobia
Claustrophobia can also be triggered by unpleasant experiences or situations, such as turbulence when flying or being stuck in a tube tunnel between stations.
A child growing up with a parent who has claustrophobia may develop claustrophobia themselves by associating confined spaces with their parent's anxiety and feeling helpless to comfort the person they loved."
Treating claustrophobia,"Many people live with claustrophobia without having it formally diagnosed and take great care to avoid confined spaces.
But getting help from a GP or a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist, can often be beneficial.
Treatments are available for claustrophobia and can include:
talking treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy
self-help - find out more about phobias and self-care on the Mind website
medicines, such as antidepressants or tranquilisers
CBT is a talking therapy that explores your thoughts, feelings and behaviour, and develops practical ways of effectively dealing with your phobia.
You can get free talking therapies, including CBT, on the NHS.
You do not need a referral from your GP.
You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service.
Find an NHS talking therapies service in your area
If you prefer, talk to a GP and they can refer you.
Exposure therapy is a type of CBT that gradually exposes you to the situation that causes your fear. It's sometimes also known as desensitisation therapy. You can do it by yourself or with the help of a professional.
Find out more about CBT and exposure therapy."
Coping with a panic attack,"If possible, stay where you are during a panic attack. It could last up to an hour, so if you're driving, you may need to pull over and park where it's safe to do so. Do not rush to a place of safety.
During the attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass.
Focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.
The symptoms of a panic attack usually peak within 10 minutes, with most attacks lasting between 5 and 30 minutes.
Get more advice on coping with a panic attack"
Help and support,"Charities, such as Anxiety UK and Anxiety Care UK, are useful sources of information and advice about how to effectively manage anxiety and phobias.
They can also put you in touch with other people who have had similar experiences.
Anxiety UK runs a helpline on 03444 775774 that's open Monday to Friday from 9.30am to 5.30pm. Calls are charged at the local rate.
You can contact Anxiety Care UK by email at support@anxietycare.org.uk for advice and support."
What does a cleft lip and palate look like?,"Babies can be born with a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.
A cleft lip may just affect one side of the lip or there may be 2 clefts.
Credit:
It can range from a small notch to a wide gap that reaches the nose.
A cleft palate may just be an opening at the back of the mouth, or it may be a split in the palate that runs all the way to the front of the mouth.
Credit:
Sometimes it can be hidden by the lining of the roof of the mouth.
The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has pictures of children with cleft lips and palates before and after surgery"
Problems related to cleft lip and palate,"A cleft lip and cleft palate can cause a number of issues, particularly in the first few months after birth, before surgery is done.
Problems can include:
difficulty feeding – a baby with a cleft lip and palate may be unable to breastfeed or feed from a normal bottle because they cannot form a good seal with their mouth
hearing problems – some babies with a cleft palate are more vulnerable to ear infections and a build-up of fluid in their ears (glue ear), which may affect their hearing
dental problems – a cleft lip and palate can mean a child's teeth do not develop correctly and they may be at a higher risk of tooth decay
speech problems – if a cleft palate is not repaired, it can lead to speech problems such as unclear or nasal-sounding speech when a child is older
Most of these problems will improve after surgery and with treatments such as speech and language therapy."
Causes of cleft lip and palate,"A cleft lip or palate happens when the structures that form the upper lip or palate fail to join together when a baby is developing in the womb.
The exact reason why this happens to some babies is often unclear. It's very unlikely to have been caused by anything you did or did not do during pregnancy.
In a few cases, cleft lip and palate is associated with:
the genes a child inherits from their parents (although most cases are a one-off)
smoking in pregnancy or drinking alcohol while pregnant
obesity during pregnancy
a lack of folic acid during pregnancy
taking certain medicines in early pregnancy, such as some anti-seizure medicines
In some cases, a cleft lip or palate can occur as part of a condition that causes a wider range of birth defects, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (sometimes called DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndrome) and Pierre Robin sequence.
The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has more information on Pierre Robin sequence"
Diagnosing cleft lip and palate,"A cleft lip is usually picked up during the 20-week screening scan done when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant. Not all cleft lips will be obvious on this scan and it's very difficult to detect a cleft palate on an ultrasound scan.
If a cleft lip or palate does not show up on the scan, it's usually diagnosed immediately after birth or during the newborn physical examination done within 72 hours of birth.
When a cleft lip or palate is diagnosed, you'll be referred to a specialist NHS cleft team who will explain your child's condition, discuss the treatments they need and answer any questions you have.
You may also find it useful to contact a support group, such as the Cleft Lip and Palate Association, who can offer advice and put you in touch with parents in a similar situation."
Treatments for cleft lip and palate,"Cleft lip and cleft palate are treated at specialist NHS cleft centres.
Your child will usually have a long-term care plan that outlines the treatments and assessments they'll need as they grow up.
The main treatments are:
surgery – an operation to correct a cleft lip is usually done when your baby is 3 to 6 months and an operation to repair a cleft palate is usually done at 6 to 12 months
feeding support – you may need advice about positioning your baby on your breast to help them feed, or you might need to feed them using a special type of bottle
monitoring hearing – a baby born with cleft palate has a higher chance of glue ear, which may affect hearing. Close monitoring of their hearing is important and if glue ear affects their hearing significantly, a hearing aid may be fitted or small tubes called grommets may be placed in their ears to drain the fluid
speech and language therapy – a speech and language therapist will monitor your child's speech and language development throughout their childhood and help with any speech and language problems
good dental hygiene and orthodontic treatment – you'll be given advice about looking after your child's teeth, and they may need braces if their adult teeth don't come through properly
Read more about how cleft lip and palate is treated"
Outlook for cleft lip and palate,"The majority of children treated for cleft lip or palate grow up to have completely normal lives.
Most affected children will not have any other serious medical problems and treatment can usually improve the appearance of the face and problems with feeding and speech.
Surgery to repair a cleft lip may leave a small pink scar above the lips. This will fade over time and become less noticeable as your child gets older.
Credit:"
Will a cleft lip and palate happen again?,"Most cases of cleft lip or palate are a one-off and it's unlikely you'll have another child with the condition.
The risk of having a child with a cleft lip or palate is slightly increased if you've had a child with the condition before, but the chances of this happening are thought to be around 2 to 8%.
If either you or your partner were born with a cleft lip or palate, your chance of having a baby with a cleft is also around 2 to 8%.
The chances of another child being born with a cleft or of a parent passing the condition to their child can be higher in cases related to a genetic condition.
For example, a parent with 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) has a 1 in 2 chance of passing the condition to their child."
Information about your child,"If your child has a cleft lip or palate, your cleft team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

How do I take part in a clinical trial?,"You can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any clinical trials that you may be eligible to join.
You can also search for information on a number of websites and register your interest in taking part in research.
Be Part of Research website
The Be Part of Research website has information about clinical trials and other research from several different UK registers.
You can also search the Be Part of Research site to find trials relevant to you, and you can contact researchers yourself.

Why join a clinical trial?,"Clinical trials help doctors understand how to treat a particular illness. It may benefit you, or others like you, in the future.
If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be one of the first people to benefit from a new treatment.
But there's also a chance that the new treatment turns out to be no better, or worse, than the standard treatment.
To hear other people's experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit the healthtalk.org website"
Will I get paid?,"Some clinical trials offer payment, which can vary depending on what's involved and expected from you.
Some trials do not offer payment and just cover your travel expenses.
It's important to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before you sign up, and to carefully weigh up whether it's worth it.
Bear in mind:
it can be time consuming – you may be expected to attend a number of screening and follow-up sessions, and some trials require you to stay overnight
there may be restrictions on what you can and cannot do – for example, you may be asked to not eat, or not drink alcohol, for a period of time
you may experience unknown side effects from the treatment"
What happens in a clinical trial?,"Testing a new medicine
All clinical trials of new medicines go through a series of phases to test whether they're safe and whether they work.
The medicines will usually be tested against another treatment called a control.
This will either be a dummy treatment (a placebo) or a standard treatment already in use.
Phase 1 trials:
A small number of people, who may be healthy volunteers, are given the medicine.
The drug is being trialled in human volunteers for the first time.
Researchers test for side effects and calculate what the right dose might be to use in treatment.
Researchers start with small doses and only increase the dose if the volunteers do not experience any side effects, or if they only experience minor side effects.
Phase 2 trials:
The new medicine is tested on a larger group of people who are ill. This is to get a better idea of its effects in the short term.
Phase 3 trials:
Carried out on medicines that have passed phases 1 and 2.
The medicine is tested in larger groups of people who are ill, and compared against an existing treatment or a placebo to see if it's better in practice and if it has important side effects.
Trials often last a year or more and involve several thousand patients.
Phase 4 trials:
The safety, side effects and effectiveness of the medicine continue to be studied while it's being used in practice.
Not required for every medicine.
Only carried out on medicines that have passed all the previous stages and have been given marketing licences – a licence means the medicine is available on prescription.
Control groups, randomisation and blinding
If you take part in a clinical trial, you'll usually be randomly assigned to either the:
treatment group – where you'll be given the treatment being assessed, or
control group – where you'll be given an existing standard treatment, or a placebo if no proven standard treatment exists
While the treatments are different in the 2 groups, researchers try to keep as many of the other conditions the same as possible.
For example, both groups should have people of a similar age, with a similar proportion of men and women, who are in similar overall health.
In most trials, a computer will be used to randomly decide which group each patient will be allocated to.
Many trials are set up so nobody knows who's been allocated to receive which treatment.
This is known as blinding, and it helps reduce the effects of bias when comparing the outcomes of the treatments."
What should I know before I sign up?,"When you express interest in a trial, a doctor or nurse is likely to tell you something about it in person.
You'll also be given some printed information to take away.
You may come back with some questions you feel have not been answered.
General questions
What's the aim of the trial and how will it help people?
Who's funding the trial?
What treatment will I get if I do not take part in the trial?
How long is the trial expected to last, and how long will I have to take part?
How long will it be before the results of the trial are known?
What will happen if I stop the trial treatment or leave the trial before it ends?
What would happen if something went wrong? It's rare for patients to be harmed by trial treatments, but you may want to ask about compensation if this were to happen.
Practical questions
How much of my time will be needed?
Will I need to take time off work?
Will I be paid?
Will the costs of my travel to take part in the trial be covered?
If the trial is testing a new drug, will I have to collect it from the hospital, will it be sent to me by post, or will I get it through my doctor?
Will I have to complete questionnaires or keep a diary?
What are the possible side effects of my treatment?
How could the treatments affect me physically and emotionally?
Who can I contact if I have a problem?
Will someone be available 24 hours a day?
How do I find out the results of the trial?
Things to weigh up
As with any treatment, you cannot be sure of the outcome.
You may be given a new treatment that turns out not to be as effective as the standard treatment.
Also, it's possible you'll experience unexpected side effects.
And bear in mind that you may have to visit your place of treatment more often, or have more tests, treatments or monitoring, than you would if you were receiving the standard treatment in usual care.
Leaving a trial
You may decide to stop taking part in a trial if your condition is getting worse or you feel the treatment is not helping you.
You can also choose to leave at any point without giving a reason and without it affecting the care you receive.
Results
At the end of the trial, the researchers should publish the results and make them available to anyone who took part and wanted to know the results.
If the researchers do not offer you the results and you want to know, ask for them.
Some research funders, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have websites where they publish the results of the research they have supported.
Visit the NIHR website to find out more"
How are trials regulated and judged ethical?,"Before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) needs to review and authorise it.
The MHRA also inspects sites where trials take place to make sure they're conducted in line with good clinical practice.
Visit the GOV.UK website to read about the MHRA
The Health Research Authority (HRA) works to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research. 
It's responsible for research ethics committees up and down the country.
All medical research involving people in the UK, whether in the NHS or the private sector, first has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee.
The committee protects the rights and interests of the people who will be in the trial.
Find out more on the HRA website"
How are trial results used to improve treatment?,"Clinical trials can help:
prevent illnesses by testing a vaccine
detect or diagnose illnesses by testing a scan or blood test
treat illnesses by testing new or existing medicines
find out how people can control their symptoms or improve their quality of life – for example, by testing how a particular diet affects an illness
Many clinical trials are designed to show whether new medicines work as expected.
These results are sent to the MHRA, which decides whether to allow the company making the medicine to market it for a particular use.

If research has identified a new medicine, the MHRA must license it before it can be marketed.
Licensing shows a treatment has met certain standards of safety and effectiveness.
Safety must be monitored carefully over the first few years of a newly licensed treatment.
This is because rare side effects that were not obvious in clinical trials may show up for the first time.
In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the NHS should provide treatments.
Find out more on the NICE website"
Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me?,"The results of clinical trials are usually published in specialist medical journals and online libraries of evidence.
Some of the most well-known examples are:
The Lancet medical journal
British Medical Journal (BMJ)
The New England Journal of Medicine
Cochrane Library – a collection of high-quality evidence
You can use a search engine such as Google to look for articles and read summaries (abstracts).
But you cannot usually see the full articles without a subscription to the journal.
Also, research papers are not written in plain English and often use many medical, scientific and statistical terms. They can be very difficult to understand."
Check if you have a C. diff infection,"Common symptoms of a C. diff infection include:
diarrhoea
a high temperature
loss of appetite
feeling sick
a stomach ache"
How you get a C. diff infection,"C. diff bacteria usually live harmlessly in your bowel along with lots of other types of bacteria.
But sometimes when you take antibiotics, the balance of bacteria in your bowel can change, causing an infection.
When someone has a C. diff infection, it can spread to other people very easily if the bacteria found in the person’s poo get onto objects and surfaces.
Who's at risk
You're more likely to get a C. diff infection if:
you're over 65 years
you're taking, or have recently taken, antibiotics
you're staying in hospital or a care home for a long time
you have a weakened immune system – for example, from having a long-term condition like diabetes or kidney failure, or treatment like chemotherapy
you're taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as omeprazole, or other medicines that reduce stomach acid
you've had a C. diff infection in the past"
Treatments for a C. diff infection,"If a doctor thinks you have a C. diff infection, they may ask for a sample of your poo to be tested.
The infection can sometimes be treated at home, or you might need to go into hospital. This is because C. diff infections can sometimes lead to more serious problems like sepsis.
A C. diff infection is treated by:
stopping any antibiotics you're taking, if possible
taking a 10-day course of another antibiotic that can treat the C. diff infection
You'll also be given advice about how to avoid dehydration, such as making sure you drink plenty of water.
Your symptoms should improve a few days after starting the new course of antibiotics. But it may be 1 to 2 weeks before the infection clears up completely.
Go back to see the GP if your symptoms get worse, you feel very unwell after starting the antibiotics, or your symptoms come back afterwards.
If your symptoms return, treatment may need to be repeated.
If the C. diff infection comes back 2 or more times, you may be offered a faecal microbiota transplant. This is where bacteria from a healthy person's poo is put into your gut to help stop the infection.
Important
Carry on taking your antibiotics until you've finished all your tablets, capsules or liquid, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, your symptoms could come back."
How to prevent spreading a C. diff infection,"C. diff infections can spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce the risk of passing it on to others.
Do
stay at home until at least 48 hours after your diarrhoea stops
wash your hands regularly using soap and water
clean the toilet and area around it with disinfectant after each use
wash clothes and sheets with poo on separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature
Don’t
do not share towels and flannels
do not take medicine to stop diarrhoea like loperamide because it can prevent the infection being cleared from your body"
Diagnosing club foot,"Club foot is usually diagnosed after a baby is born, although it may be spotted during the routine ultrasound scan done between 18 and 21 weeks.
Diagnosing club foot during pregnancy means you can talk to doctors and find out what to expect after your baby is born.
Some babies are born with normal feet that are in an unusual position because they have been squashed in the womb.
The feet usually correct themselves by 3 months, but some babies may need a few sessions of physiotherapy."
Treating club foot,"Treatment for club foot usually starts within 1 to 2 weeks of your baby being born.
The main treatment, called the Ponseti method, involves gently manipulating and stretching your baby's foot into a better position. It's then put into a cast.
This is repeated every week for about 5 to 8 weeks.
After the last cast comes off, most babies need a minor operation to loosen the Achilles tendon at the back of their ankle.
This is done using a local anaesthetic. It helps to release their foot into a more natural position.
Your baby will need to wear special boots attached to each other with a bar to prevent the club foot returning.
Credit:
They'll need to wear these all the time for the first 3 months, then overnight until they're 4 or 5 years old.
Outcome
Nearly all children with club foot are treated successfully.
Most should be able to take part in regular daily activities. They will learn to walk at the usual age, enjoy physical activities and be able to wear regular footwear after treatment.
Children who only have 1 affected foot may be left with a slightly shorter leg and a smaller foot.
This may mean your child is slightly less mobile and gets tired more quickly than other children.
Relapses
Sometimes club foot can come back, especially if treatment is not followed exactly.
If it comes back, some of the treatment stages may need to be repeated."
Causes of club foot,"In most cases the cause of club foot is not known. There may be a genetic link, as it can run in families.
If you have a child with a club foot or feet, your chance of having a 2nd child with the condition is about 1 in 35.
If 1 parent has a club foot, there's about a 1 in 30 chance of your baby having it.
If both parents have the condition, this increases to about a 1 in 3 chance.
In rare cases, club foot is linked to more serious conditions, such as spina bifida."
Support for club foot,"The charity Steps Worldwide offers help and support for anyone affected by childhood lower limb conditions, including club foot.

Check if it's a cluster headache,"Cluster headaches are severe headaches that can happen multiple times a day and continue for weeks or months. They may stop for a while (weeks, months or years), or there may be no gap between headaches.
The main symptoms of a cluster headache include:
a sharp, burning or piercing pain, usually on 1 side of the head, around the eye
headaches that happen at the same time of year or at set times of the day
headaches that start and stop quickly, without warning
pain that can make you feel restless, you may want to walk around or move your body
headaches that last between 15 minutes and 3 hours
You may also get other symptoms, such as:
a red and watering eye on the same side as the pain
feeling sick
drooping and swelling in the eyelid on the same side as the pain
a smaller pupil in the eye on the same side as the pain
face sweating
a blocked or runny nose"
What happens at your appointment,"There are no specific tests to diagnose cluster headaches. A GP will ask you about the pain, location and frequency of your headaches. They’ll also ask about any other symptoms you’re having.
Other conditions can have similar symptoms to cluster headaches. A GP may refer you to a specialist for a brain scan to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms."
Treatments for cluster headaches,"There’s no cure for cluster headaches, but a specialist may recommend treatments to help ease and prevent symptoms.
Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, do not work.
Treatments that help during a cluster headache
If a cluster headache has already started, the main treatments include:
medicines called triptans, given as an injection or a nasal spray
oxygen, which is breathed through a mask
using a device to give mild electrical pulses to the back of the neck
Rarely, when other treatments have not worked, you may be offered surgery. This involves implanting a small device to help treat your headaches.
Treatments to prevent a cluster headache
Your GP may prescribe medicines that can help to prevent a cluster headache before it starts.
These can include corticosteroids, verapamil or lithium.
Ask a GP for advice about common triggers. Understanding this may help you to avoid a cluster headache"
Causes of a cluster headache,"It’s not known what causes cluster headaches.
They’re more common in men in their 30s and 40s, or if you have a close family member who gets them.
Some people find certain triggers can cause cluster headaches, such as:
smoking
drinking alcohol
perfume
the smell of paint, nail varnish or petrol
exercise
Keeping a headache diary may help you to understand your triggers."

Check if you have tailbone (coccyx) pain,"The main symptom of tailbone (coccyx) pain is pain and tenderness at the base of your spine, near the top of your bottom.
It may feel dull and achy most of the time, with occasional sharp pains.
The pain may be worse:
while you're sitting down
when you sit down or stand up
when you bend forward
when you're having a poo
during sex
during your period
You may also find it difficult to sleep and carry out daily activities."
How you can ease tailbone (coccyx) pain yourself,"Tailbone (coccyx) pain may improve after a few weeks, but it can sometimes last longer. There are some things you can do to help ease the pain.
Do
sit correctly – maintain good posture with your lower back supported
use a specially designed coccyx cushion when sitting – sitting on an exercise ball can also help
lie on your side to reduce the pressure on your coccyx
try pelvic floor exercises (particularly important during pregnancy)
use an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on the affected area for 20 to 30 minutes – you can also use a heat pack for longer
use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to help reduce the pain
use a laxative to soften your poo if the pain is worse when pooing – ask a pharmacist for a laxative that softens poo
Don’t
do not sit for a long time
do not wear clothes that are tight around your bottom and lower back, like some types of jeans"
Treatments for tailbone (coccyx) pain,"Further treatments are available if simple things like pelvic floor exercises and ibuprofen have not helped your tailbone (coccyx) pain.
The 2 treatments that may be recommended first are:
physiotherapy – the muscles around the coccyx can be manipulated to help ease the pain
corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections – into the joint that attaches the coccyx to the bottom of your spine; you'll usually have a maximum of 2 injections given on consecutive months
If physiotherapy and injections do not help reduce the pain, surgery to remove part or all of your coccyx may be recommended."
Causes of tailbone (coccyx) pain,"Common causes of tailbone (coccyx) pain include:
pregnancy and childbirth
an injury or accident, such as a fall onto your coccyx
repeated or prolonged strain on the coccyx – for example, after sitting for a long time while driving or cycling
poor posture
being overweight or underweight
joint hypermobility (increased flexibility) of the joint that attaches the coccyx to the bottom of the spine
Sometimes the cause of tailbone pain is unknown."
Symptoms of coeliac disease,"Eating foods that contain gluten can trigger a range of gut symptoms, such as:
diarrhoea, which may smell particularly unpleasant
stomach aches
bloating and farting (flatulence)
indigestion
constipation
Coeliac disease can also cause more general symptoms, including:
tiredness (fatigue) as a result of not getting enough nutrients from food (malnutrition)
unintentional weight loss
an itchy rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)
problems getting pregnant (infertility)
nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)
disorders that affect co-ordination, balance and speech (ataxia)
Children with coeliac disease may not grow at the expected rate and may have delayed puberty."
What causes coeliac disease?,"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
In coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them.
This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to take in nutrients from food.
It's not entirely clear what causes the immune system to act this way, but a combination of genetics and the environment appear to play a part."
Treating coeliac disease,"There's no cure for coeliac disease, but following a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition.
Even if you have mild symptoms, changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms.
It's important to ensure that your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced.
An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet."
Complications of coeliac disease,"Complications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people who continue to eat gluten, or those who have not yet been diagnosed with the condition, which can be a common problem in milder cases.
Potential long-term complications include:
weakening of the bones (osteoporosis)
iron deficiency anaemia
vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Less common and more serious complications include some types of cancers, such as bowel cancer, and problems affecting pregnancy, such as your baby having a low birth weight.
Find out more about the complications of coeliac disease."
Who's affected,"Coeliac disease is a condition that affects at least 1 in every 100 people in the UK.
But some experts think this may be underestimated because milder cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Reported cases of coeliac disease are higher in women than men.
It can develop at any age.
People with certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, Down's syndrome and Turner syndrome, have an increased risk of getting coeliac disease.
First-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters and children) of people with coeliac disease are also at increased risk of developing the condition."
Diagnosing coeliac disease,"Routine testing for coeliac disease is not done in England.
Testing is usually only recommended for people who have symptoms, or who have an increased risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with a family history of the condition.
First-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease should be tested.
Read about diagnosing coeliac disease for more information about when testing for coeliac disease should be done."
Help and support,"Coeliac UK is a UK charity for people with coeliac disease.
Its website has useful resources, including information about a gluten-free diet, local groups, volunteering and ongoing campaigns.
You can also call the Coeliac UK helpline 0333 332 2033, open Monday to Friday from 10am to 4pm."
Check if it's a cold sore,"A cold sore usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning feeling.
Over the next 48 hours one or more painful blisters will appear on your face.
Cold sore blisters are usually small and filled with fluid.
Credit:
The blisters can appear anywhere on the face.
Credit:
The blisters burst and crust over into a scab.
Credit:
Cold sores should start to heal within 10 days, but are contagious and may be irritating or painful while they heal.
Certain things may trigger a cold sore, such as illness, sunshine or being on your period."
How long cold sores are contagious,"Cold sores are contagious from the moment you first feel tingling or other signs of a cold sore coming on to when the cold sore has completely healed.
They can easily spread to other people and other parts of your body.
To help stop cold sores spreading:
wash your hands with soap and water whenever you touch your cold sore
do not kiss anyone while you have a cold sore
do not have oral sex until your cold sore completely heals as you could give your partner genital herpes
Important
Kissing a baby if you have a cold sore can lead to neonatal herpes, which is very dangerous to newborn babies."
A pharmacist can help with cold sores,"A pharmacist can recommend:
creams to ease pain and irritation
antiviral creams to speed up healing time
cold sore patches to protect the skin while it heals
You can buy electronic devices from pharmacies that treat cold sores with light or lasers.
You may find these helpful, but there's not much evidence to confirm they work.
Information:
If you regularly get cold sores, use antiviral creams as soon as you recognise the early tingling feeling. They do not always work after blisters appear.
Find a pharmacy"
Things you can do yourself to help with cold sores,"There are things you can do to help ease cold sores while they heal and to avoid triggering a cold sore.
Do
avoid anything that triggers your cold sores, such as sunbeds
use sunblock lip balm (SPF 15 or above) if you're outside in the sun
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease pain and swelling (liquid paracetamol is available for children) – do not give aspirin to children under 16
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
Don’t
do not touch your cold sore (apart from applying antiviral cream) – and if you do wash your hands before and after
do not rub cream into the cold sore – dab it on instead
do not eat acidic or salty food if it makes your cold sore feel worse"
Treatment for cold sores from a GP,"A GP may prescribe antiviral tablets if your cold sores are very large, painful or keep coming back.
Newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system may be referred to hospital for advice or treatment."
Why cold sores come back,"Cold sores are caused by a virus called herpes simplex.
Most people are exposed to the virus when they're children after close skin to skin contact, such as kissing, with someone who has a cold sore.
Once you have the virus, it stays in your skin for the rest of your life. Sometimes it causes a cold sore."
Check if your baby has colic,"All babies cry, but your baby may have colic if they cry more than 3 hours a day, 3 days a week for at least 1 week but are otherwise healthy.
They may cry more often in the afternoon and evening.
It may also be colic if, while they are crying:
it's hard to soothe or settle your baby
they clench their fists
they go red in the face
they bring their knees up to their tummy or arch their back
their tummy rumbles or they're very windy
It can start when a baby is a few weeks old. It usually stops by the time they're 3 to 4 months old."
Things you can try to soothe your baby,"Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have colic. Speak to your health visitor for advice and support.
Health visitors and doctors will usually advise you to:
hold or cuddle your baby when they're crying a lot
sit or hold your baby upright during feeding to stop them swallowing air
wind your baby after feeds
gently rock your baby over your shoulder
gently rock your baby in their Moses basket or crib, or push them in their pram
bath your baby in a warm bath
have some gentle white noise like the radio or TV in the background to distract them
keep feeding your baby as usual
Other things you may hear about include:
anti-colic drops and herbal and probiotic supplements
changes to your diet if you're breastfeeding
applying gentle pressure to your baby's spine (spinal manipulation) or skull (cranial osteopathy)
But there's very little evidence these things work. Speak to your health visitor for further advice."
How to cope if you have a colicky baby,"Looking after a colicky baby can be upsetting, but it's usually nothing to worry about and will pass with time.
Ask for support:
from other parents, family or friends
by calling the Cry-sis helpline free on 0800 448 0737 (9am to 10pm, 7 days a week)
from your health visitor, by calling NHS 111 or seeing a GP"
Causes of colic,"It's not known exactly what causes some babies to get colic. But it may be because babies find it harder to digest food when they're young.
Or they may be crying because they have problems with food allergies, such as a cows' milk allergy."
When a colostomy is needed,"A colostomy may be needed if you cannot pass stools through your anus. This could be the result of an illness, injury or problem with your digestive system.
You may have a colostomy to treat:
bowel cancer
Crohn's disease
diverticulitis
anal cancer
vaginal cancer or cervical cancer
bowel incontinence
Hirschsprung's disease
A colostomy is often used after a section of the colon has been removed and the bowel cannot be joined back together.
This may be temporary and followed by another operation to reverse the colostomy at a later date, or it may be permanent.
Read more about reversing a colostomy"
How a colostomy is carried out ,"A colostomy is carried out while you're asleep under general anaesthetic, using either:
open surgery (laparotomy) – where a long cut (incision) is made in the tummy to access the colon, or
laparoscopic (keyhole surgery) – where the surgeon makes several smaller incisions and uses a tiny camera and surgical instruments to access the colon
Generally, keyhole surgery is the preferred option because recovery is quicker and the risk of complications is lower.
There are 2 main types of colostomy: a loop colostomy and an end colostomy. The specific technique used will depend on your circumstances. 
A loop colostomy is often used if the colostomy is temporary as it's easier to reverse.
Loop colostomy
In a loop colostomy, a loop of colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy. The loop is opened up and stitched to your skin to form an opening called a stoma.
The stoma has 2 openings that are close together. One is connected to the functioning part of your bowel, where waste leaves your body after the operation.
The other opening is connected to the inactive part of your bowel, leading to your anus.
In some cases, a support device (a rod or bridge) may be used to hold the loop of colon in place while it heals. It's usually removed after a few days.
End colostomy
With an end colostomy, 1 end of the colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy and stitched to the skin to create a stoma.
An end colostomy is often permanent. Temporary end colostomies are sometimes used in emergencies.
The stoma
The position of the stoma will depend on the section of your colon that's diverted, but it's usually on the left-hand side of your tummy, below your waist.
If the operation is planned in advance, you'll meet a specialist stoma nurse to discuss the positioning of the stoma.
The stoma will be red and moist and may bleed slightly, particularly in the beginning – this is normal. It should not be painful as it does not have a nerve supply."
Recovering from a colostomy,"After having a colostomy, you'll need to recover in hospital for a few days.
You may have:
a drip in your vein to provide fluids
a catheter to drain urine from your bladder
an oxygen mask to help you breathe
A clear colostomy bag will be placed over the stoma so it can be easily monitored and drained. The first bag is often quite large – it'll usually be replaced with a smaller bag before you go home.
Stoma nurse
While you recover in hospital, a stoma nurse will show you how to care for your stoma, including how to empty and change the bag.
The nurse will teach you how to keep your stoma and surrounding skin clean and free from irritation, and give you advice about preventing infection.
They'll also explain the different types of equipment available and how to get new supplies.
When you leave hospital, a local stoma nurse will visit you at home, or you may be asked to go to a stoma care clinic.
Going home
Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 10 days after having a colostomy.
Once home, avoid strenuous activities that could place a strain on your abdomen, such as lifting heavy objects.
Your stoma nurse will give you advice about how soon you can go back to normal activities.
At first you will pass wind through your stoma and then, usually within 2 or 3 days, you poo through it.
This should start to improve as your bowel recovers from the effects of the operation."
Living with a colostomy,"Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people get used to it in time.
Colostomy equipment is discreet and secure, and you should be able to do most of the activities you enjoyed before.
Your specialist stoma nurse will be able to give you further support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy.
Read more about living with a colostomy and complications of a colostomy.

Their website has information about products you may find useful, and also provides details of stoma support groups in your area."
Check if it's colour vision deficiency,"The main symptom of colour vision deficiency is finding it hard to tell the difference between colours.
You can be born with colour vision deficiency, or it can start at any age.
If your child has colour vision deficiency you may not notice any symptoms, but you may notice your child:
uses the wrong colours when drawing or painting, for example, drawing purple leaves on trees
has difficulty with tasks involving sorting colours
lacks interest in colouring tasks
smells food before eating it"
Tests for colour vision deficiency,"There are 2 main tests for colour vision deficiency:
the Ishihara test, where you'll be asked to read images made up of coloured dots
colour arrangement tests, where you'll be asked to put coloured objects in order of what shade they are
Colour vision testing is not part of the routine NHS eye test, but you can ask your opticians for it if you think you or your child needs it.
Tests are available online, but it's important to get checked at an opticians if you have concerns about your vision."
Causes of colour vision deficiency,"It's not known exactly what causes colour vision deficiency, but it's thought to be a problem with the signals from your eyes to your brain.
It can be passed on in families and some people are born with it.
Colour vision deficiency can also sometimes be caused by:
eye conditions, such as glaucoma
other conditions such as diabetes, liver disease and multiple sclerosis
an eye or head injury
a stroke
taking certain medicines"
Treatment for colour vision deficiency,"There is currently no treatment for colour vision deficiency that runs in families. Most people adapt to seeing colours differently.
If your colour vision has been affected by an underlying medical condition or by medicines, getting treatment for the condition or changing medicines may help."
What is a coma?,"Someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They're alive but can't be woken up and show no signs of awareness.
The person's eyes will be closed and they'll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won't normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily, and basic reflexes, such as coughing and swallowing, will be greatly reduced.
They may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe.
Over time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative or minimally conscious state. Read more about disorders of consciousness."
Caring for and monitoring a person in a coma,"Doctors assess a person's level of consciousness using a tool called the Glasgow Coma Scale (on Headway's website). This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses 3 things:
eye opening – a score of 1 means no eye opening, and 4 means opens eyes spontaneously
verbal response to a command – a score of 1 means no response, and 5 means alert and replying appropriately
voluntary movements in response to a command – a score of 1 means no response, and 6 means obeys commands
Most people in a coma will have a total score of 8 or less. A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover.
In the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after in an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated.
In the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. This can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don't develop bedsores and gently exercising their joints to stop them becoming tight."
What you can do as a visitor,"The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don't.
When visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find this advice helpful:
when you arrive, announce who you are
talk to them about your day as you normally would – be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard
show them your love and support – even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be a great comfort
Research has also suggested that stimulating the main senses – touch, hearing, vision and smell – could potentially help a person recover from a coma. Focus on pleasant sensations, 1 sensation at a time for short periods of time.
As well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume."
Recovering from a coma,"A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state:
a vegetative state – where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves
a minimally conscious state – where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes
Some people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all. See the page on disorders of consciousness for more information about these conditions.
People who do wake up from a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with.
Some people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives.
The chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they've been in a coma. But it's impossible to accurately predict whether the person will eventually recover, how long the coma will last and whether they'll have any long-term problems."

Check if you have a cold,"Cold symptoms come on gradually and can include:
a blocked or runny nose
a sore throat
headaches
muscle aches
coughs
sneezing
a raised temperature
pressure in your ears and face
loss of taste and smell
The symptoms are the same in adults and children. Sometimes symptoms last longer in children."
How you can treat a cold yourself,"To help you get better more quickly:
rest and sleep
drink plenty of water (fruit juice or squash mixed with water is OK) to avoid dehydration
gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat (not suitable for children)
If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.
A pharmacist can help with cold medicines
You can buy cough and cold medicines from pharmacies or supermarkets. A pharmacist can advise you on the best medicine.
You can:
ease aches or lower a temperature with painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen
relieve a blocked nose with decongestant sprays or tablets
Decongestants should not be given to children under 6. Children aged 6 to 12 should take them for no longer than 5 days.
Be careful not to use cough and cold medicines if you're taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets. Cough and cold medicines often also contain paracetamol and ibuprofen so it can be easy to take more than the recommended dose.
Some are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women.
There's little evidence that supplements (such as vitamin C, echinacea or garlic) prevent colds or speed up recovery.

How to avoid spreading a cold,"Colds are caused by viruses and easily spread to other people. You're infectious until all your symptoms have gone. This usually takes 1 to 2 weeks.
Colds are spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
To reduce the risk of spreading a cold:
wash your hands often with warm water and soap
use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as quickly as possible"
How to prevent catching a cold,"A person with a cold can start spreading it from a few days before their symptoms begin until the symptoms have finished.
The best ways to avoid catching a cold are:
washing your hands with warm water and soap
not sharing towels or household items (like cups) with someone who has a cold
not touching your eyes or nose in case you have come into contact with the virus – it can infect the body this way
staying fit and healthy
The flu vaccine helps prevent flu but not colds."
Check if you have compartment syndrome,"You can get compartment syndrome in any muscle, but it most often affects the muscles in the lower legs and forearms.
Symptoms include:
pain in a muscle – this may feel like a burning pain or a deep ache (moving the body part can make the pain even worse)
swelling or bulging of the muscle
numbness, weakness or pins and needles
tightness or difficulty moving the affected body part
The symptoms can start suddenly, such as after an injury or if a bandage or plaster cast is too tight. This is called acute compartment syndrome.
Symptoms can also come on gradually after exercising and go away when you rest. This is called chronic compartment syndrome."
Tests for compartment syndrome,"If the GP thinks you may have compartment syndrome, you may be referred to a specialist for tests.
Tests you may have include:
an X-ray to check if you’ve broken a bone
MRI scans while you’re resting and while you’re exercising
compartment pressure measurement – a needle connected to a pressure monitoring device is inserted into your muscle before and after exercise to measure the pressure inside it
Measuring the pressure inside a muscle is usually only recommended if your symptoms and other test results suggest compartment syndrome."
Treatments for compartment syndrome,"Treatment for compartment syndrome depends on whether it happens suddenly or comes on gradually.
Sudden (acute) compartment syndrome
If compartment syndrome happens suddenly, you’ll need surgery as soon as possible to relieve the pressure in the muscle.
This type of surgery is called a fasciotomy. During a fasciotomy, the surgeon makes cuts around the muscle to relieve the pressure.
Sometimes, skin may need to be removed from another part of the body and used to cover the wound. This is known as a skin graft.
After the operation, you’ll have medicine to help ease any pain. You may also need physiotherapy to help regain full movement in the affected part of your body.
Gradual (chronic) compartment syndrome
Treatment is often not needed for compartment syndrome that develops gradually.
To help relieve your symptoms you can:
avoid the activity that caused them – if you run, switching to a low-impact exercise, such as cycling, may help
use anti-inflammatory painkillers to reduce the pain and discomfort
have physiotherapy
use inserts (orthotics) in your shoes if you start running again
If your symptoms do not improve after trying these things, surgery may be an option. The operation is similar to the one used to treat acute compartment syndrome."
Defining CAM,"There's no universally agreed definition of CAM.
Although ""complementary and alternative"" is often used as a single category, it can be useful to make a distinction between the terms.
The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) uses this distinction:
When a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it's considered ""complementary"".
When a non-mainstream practice is used instead of conventional medicine, it's considered ""alternative"".
There can be overlap between these categories.
For example, aromatherapy may sometimes be used as a complementary treatment and in other circumstances is used as an alternative treatment.
A number of complementary and alternative treatments are typically used with the intention of treating or curing a health condition.
Examples include:
homeopathy
acupuncture
chiropractic
herbal medicines"
Deciding to use complementary or alternative treatments,"To understand whether a treatment is safe and effective, we need to check the evidence.
You can learn more about the evidence for particular CAM practices by reading about individual types of treatment.
See our Health A to Z index for a list of all conditions and treatments on the NHS website.
Some CAM treatments are based on principles and an evidence base that are not recognised by the majority of independent scientists.
Others have been proven to work for a limited number of health conditions.
For example, there's evidence that chiropractic is effective for treating lower back pain.
When a person uses any health treatment, including CAM, and experiences an improvement, this may be due to the placebo effect."
CAM and the NHS,"The availability of CAM on the NHS is limited, and in most cases the NHS will not offer such treatments.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidance to the NHS on effective treatments that are value for money.
NICE has recommended the use of CAM in a limited number of circumstances.
For example:
the Alexander technique for Parkinson's disease
ginger and acupressure for reducing morning sickness
manual therapy for lower back pain"
Finding a CAM practitioner,"If you think you may have a health condition, first see your GP. Do not visit a CAM practitioner instead of seeing your GP.
It's particularly important to talk to your GP before trying CAM if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant.
Some CAM treatments may interact with medicines that you're taking or should not be tried if you're pregnant.
CAM and regulation
The practice of conventional medicine is regulated by laws that ensure that practitioners are properly qualified and adhere to certain standards or codes of practice. This is called statutory professional regulation.
Chiropractors are regulated in the same way. However, there's no statutory professional regulation of any other CAM practitioners.
Finding a chiropractor
Chiropractic is regulated in the same way as conventional medicine.
All chiropractors must be registered with the General Chiropractic Council. You can use the General Chiropractic Council website to find a registered chiropractor near you or check if someone offering chiropractic services is registered.
Finding other CAM practitioners
Apart from chiropractic, there's no professional statutory regulation of complementary and alternative treatments in the UK.
This means:
it's legal for anyone to practise the treatment, even if they have no or limited formal qualifications or experience
these practitioners are not legally required to adhere to any standards of practice or to join an association or register
If you decide to use a CAM practitioner, it's up to you to find one who will carry out the treatment in a way that's acceptable to you. Professional bodies and voluntary registers can help you do this.
Some regulated healthcare professionals, such as GPs, also practise unregulated CAM.
In these instances, the CAM practice is not regulated by the organisation that regulates the healthcare professional (such as the General Medical Council), but these organisations will investigate complaints that relate to the professional conduct of their member.
Professional associations and accredited registers for CAM
Many types of CAM have voluntary registers, some of which are accredited by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA) or professional associations that practitioners can join if they choose.
Usually, these associations or registers demand that practitioners hold certain qualifications and agree to practise to a certain standard.
Organisations with PSA-accredited voluntary registers include:
the British Acupuncture Council
the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council
the International Federation of Aromatherapists
This means that these organisations have met the PSA's demanding standards, which are designed to help people make an informed choice when they're looking for a practitioner.
Read about accredited registers on the Professional Standards Authority website
Questions to ask before starting a treatment
Once you have found a practitioner, it's a good idea to ask them some questions to help you decide if you want to go ahead with treatment.
You could ask:
about the cost of treatment
how long the treatment will last
whether there are any people who should not use this treatment
what side effects the treatment might cause
whether there's anything you should do to prepare for treatment
what system the practitioner has for dealing with complaints about their treatment or service
for documentary proof of their qualifications
for documentary proof that they're a member of their professional association or voluntary register
for documentary proof that they're insured
for written references"
When to get medical advice,"You should see a GP if you have persistent pain that's preventing you from carrying out everyday activities.
Diagnosing CRPS can be difficult because it involves having tests to rule out other possible causes.
It's best to get help as soon as possible, as early treatment may help reduce your painful symptoms.
Find out more about diagnosing CRPS."
Causes of CRPS,"The cause of CRPS is unknown, but for many people it's thought to be the result of the body reacting abnormally to an injury.
Find out more about the possible causes of CRPS."
Who's affected,"It's difficult to estimate exactly how common CRPS is, as many cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed. But it's thought to be fairly uncommon.
CRPS can affect people of any age, including children. It tends to be more common in women than men."
Treating CRPS,"There's currently no cure for CRPS, but there are a number of treatments that can help manage the symptoms.
There are 4 main types of treatment:
education and self-management – being given clear information about your condition and advice on any steps you can take to help manage it yourself
physical rehabilitation – treatment to help manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term physical problems, such as physiotherapy exercises
pain relief – treatments to help reduce your pain, such as anticonvulsants or antidepressants
psychological support – treatments to help you cope with the emotional impact of living with CRPS, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Because of the complex nature of CRPS, a number of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care.
Find out more about treating CRPS."
How to care for a minor head injury,"If you have been sent home from hospital with a minor head injury, or you do not need to go to hospital, you can usually look after yourself or your child at home.
You might have symptoms of concussion, such as a slight headache or feeling sick or dazed, for up to 2 weeks.
Do
hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas in a tea towel) to the area regularly for short periods in the first few days to bring down any swelling
rest and avoid stress – you or your child do not need to stay awake if you're tired
take painkillers such as paracetamol for headaches
make sure an adult stays with you or your child for at least the first 24 hours
Don’t
do not go back to work or school until you're feeling better
do not drive until you feel you have fully recovered
do not play contact sports for at least 3 weeks – children should avoid rough play for a few days
do not take drugs or drink alcohol until you're feeling better
do not take sleeping pills while you're recovering unless a doctor advises you to
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your or your child's symptoms last more than 2 weeks
you're not sure if it's safe for you to drive or return to work, school or sports"
Who can use condoms,"Most people can use condoms.
Some condoms are made from latex, others are latex free. It will say on the packet what the condom is made of.
Do not use latex condoms if:
you have a latex allergy
you’re using antifungal medicine on or around your anus, vulva and vagina, or penis and testicles"
Using a condom,"Condoms can be used for:
vaginal sex
anal sex
oral sex
Some people also put condoms on sex toys.
Do
use a new condom every time you have sex
follow the instructions on the condom packet to put it on correctly
check the use by date has not expired – an expired condom may not be effective
check the packet for a European CE mark or UKCA mark – this means it’s been tested to high safety standards
Don’t
do not use more than one condom – this can make one or both condoms split
do not use oil-based lubricant with latex condoms – use water-based or silicone-based lubricant instead
How to use a condom
Put the condom on before you start having sex (before the penis touches the vagina or anus).
Make sure the penis is fully erect.
Open the packet carefully so you do not damage the condom. Do not use your teeth as this could rip the condom.
Hold the tip of the condom to squeeze out any air.
Roll the condom all the way down to the base of the penis. If the condom does not roll down, you may have put it on the wrong way round. Throw it away and use a new condom.
Keep the condom on until you finish having sex. When you've finished, grip the base of the condom as you pull out to stop it coming off the penis.
Always put used condoms in the bin, not in the toilet.
Information:
Watch a video about how to put on a condom on the NHS YouTube channel."
How well condoms work,"How well condoms work at preventing pregnancy
Condoms are up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy if you use them correctly every time you have sex.
If not used correctly they’re 82% effective, which means around 1 in 5 women who use condoms for a year will get pregnant.
Incorrect use includes:
putting a condom on after the penis has touched the vagina
a condom splitting or coming off during sex
How well condoms work to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Using a condom every time you have sex is the best way to protect you and your partner from HIV and other STIs."
Where to get condoms,"Contraception services are free and confidential on the NHS.
You can get condoms for free from:
sexual health clinics, also called family planning or contraception clinics
some GP surgeries and pharmacies
some young people's services (call the national sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for more information)
You can also buy condoms from pharmacies and supermarkets or online.
Find contraception information and advice services
Getting contraception if you’re under 16
Contraception is free and confidential, including for young people under the age of 16.
The doctor or nurse will not tell anyone, including your parents or carer, unless they think you or someone else is at risk of harm."
How to tell if someone is confused,"If a person is confused, they may:
not be able to think or speak clearly or quickly
not know where they are (feel disorientated)
struggle to pay attention or remember things
see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations)
Try asking the person their name, their age and today's date. If they seem unsure or cannot answer you, they probably need medical help."
Things you can do while waiting for an ambulance,"If you're with someone who has suddenly become confused, there are things you can do while waiting for medical help.
Do
stay with the person – tell them who you are and where they are, and keep reassuring them
use simple words and short sentences
make a note of any medicines they're taking, if possible
Don’t
do not ask lots of questions while they're feeling confused
do not stop the person moving around, unless they're in danger"
Causes of sudden confusion,"Sudden confusion can be caused by many different things. Do not try to self-diagnose. Get medical help if someone suddenly becomes confused or delirious.
Some of the most common causes of sudden confusion include:
an infection – urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause in elderly people or people with dementia
a stroke or TIA (""mini-stroke"")
a low blood sugar level in people with diabetes
a head injury
some types of prescription medicine
alcohol poisoning or alcohol withdrawal
taking drugs
carbon monoxide poisoning – especially if other people you live with become unwell
a severe asthma attack or other problems with the lungs or heart
certain types of seizures caused by epilepsy"
Why it happens,"In most cases, no obvious cause of congenital heart disease is identified. However, some things are known to increase the risk of the condition, including:
Down's syndrome – a genetic disorder that affects a baby's normal physical development and causes learning difficulties
the mother having certain infections, such as rubella, during pregnancy
the mother taking certain types of medicine during pregnancy, including statins and some acne medicines
the mother smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy
the mother having poorly controlled type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes
other chromosome defects, where genes may be altered from normal and can be inherited (run in the family)
Read more about the causes of congenital heart disease and preventing congenital heart disease.
Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan in pregnancy. However, it's not always possible to detect congenital heart defects in this way."
Signs and symptoms,"Congenital heart disease can have a number of symptoms, particularly in babies and children, including:
rapid heartbeat
rapid breathing
swelling of the legs, tummy or around the eyes
extreme tiredness and fatigue
a blue tinge to the skin or lips (cyanosis)
tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding
These problems are sometimes noticeable soon after birth, although mild defects may not cause any problems until later in life.
Read more about the symptoms of congenital heart disease and diagnosing congenital heart disease."
Types of congenital heart disease,"There are many types of congenital heart disease and they sometimes occur in combination. Some of the more common defects include:
septal defects – where there's a hole between 2 of the heart's chambers (commonly referred to as a ""hole in the heart"")
coarctation of the aorta – where the main large artery of the body, called the aorta, is narrower than normal
pulmonary valve stenosis – where the pulmonary valve, which controls the flow of blood out of the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs, is narrower than normal
transposition of the great arteries – where the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions
underdeveloped heart – where part of the heart doesn’t develop properly making it difficult for it to pump enough blood around the body or lungs
Read more about the types of congenital heart disease."
Treating congenital heart disease,"Treatment for congenital heart disease usually depends on the defect you or your child has.
Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, often don't need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems.
Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function.
However, people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time.
Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited and they may need to take extra steps to protect themselves from getting infections.
It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team.
Read more about treating congenital heart disease and the complications of congenital heart disease."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child has congenital heart disease, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat congenital heart disease. You can opt out of the register at any time."
The heart,"The heart is divided into 4 main sections called chambers. These are known as the:
left atrium (collects blood returning from the lungs)
left ventricle (the main pumping chamber for the body)
right atrium (collects blood returning from the body's veins)
right ventricle (pumps bloods to the lungs)
There are also 4 valves controlling how the blood flows through the heart and around the body. These are known as the:
mitral valve (separating the left atrium from the left ventricle)
aortic valve (separating the left ventricle from the main artery, the aorta)
tricuspid valve (separating the right atrium from the right ventricle)
pulmonary valve (separating the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery to the lung)
Congenital heart disease can occur if any of these chambers or valves doesn't develop properly while a baby is in the womb."
Diagnosing DDH,"Your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of being born, and again at 6 to 8 weeks of age.
The examination involves gently moving your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. It should not cause them any discomfort.
If a doctor, midwife or nurse thinks your baby's hip feels unstable, they should have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old.
Babies should also have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old if:
there have been childhood hip problems in your family
your baby was born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy
If you have had twins or multiples and 1 of the babies was in the breech position, each baby should have an ultrasound scan of their hips by the time they're 4 to 6 weeks old.
Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due, but they should still be checked to make sure.
Get help and support from the charity Steps if your baby's been diagnosed with DDH"
Treating DDH,"Pavlik harness
Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint called a Pavlik harness.
This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally.
Credit:
The harness needs to be worn constantly for 6 to 12 weeks and should not be removed by anyone except a health professional.
The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments. Your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you.
Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're wearing a Pavlik harness.
This will include information on:
how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness – nappies can be worn normally
cleaning the harness if it's soiled – it still should not be removed, but can be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush
positioning your baby while they sleep – they should be placed on their back and not on their side
how to avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness – you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands
Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed.
You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off. Swimming is often recommended.
Surgery
Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're 6 months old, or if the Pavlik harness has not helped.
The most common surgery is called reduction. This involves placing the femoral head back into the hip socket.
Reduction surgery is done under general anaesthetic and may be done as either:
closed reduction – the femoral head is placed in the hip socket without making any large cuts
open reduction – a cut is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the femoral head into the hip socket
Your child may need to wear a cast for at least 12 weeks after the operation.
Their hip will be checked under general anaesthetic again after 6 weeks, to make sure it's stable and healing well.
After this investigation, your child will probably wear a cast for at least another 6 weeks to allow their hip to fully stabilise.
Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date, to correct any bone deformities."
Late-stage signs of DDH,"The newborn physical screening examination, and the infant screening examination at 6 to 8 weeks, aim to diagnose DDH early.
But sometimes hip problems can develop or show up after these checks.
It's important to contact a GP as soon as possible if you notice your child has developed any of the following symptoms:
1 leg cannot be moved out sideways as far as the other when you change their nappy
1 leg seems to be longer than the other
1 leg drags when they crawl
a limp or ""waddling"" walk
Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip."
Hip-healthy swaddling,"A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. But if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped (swaddled) with their legs straight and pressed together, there's a risk this may affect their hip development.
Using hip-healthy swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick.
Find out more about hip-healthy swaddling on the International Hip Dysplasia Institute website"
Check if you have conjunctivitis,"Conjunctivitis is also known as red or pink eye.
It usually affects both eyes and makes them:
red
burn or feel gritty
produce pus that sticks to lashes
itch
water
Conjunctivitis that produces sticky pus is contagious.
Credit:
If eyes are red and feel gritty, the conjunctivitis is also usually contagious.
Credit:
Credit:
Conjunctivitis caused by allergies like hay fever makes eyes red and watery but is not contagious.

How to treat conjunctivitis yourself,"There are things you can do to help ease your symptoms.
Boil water and let it cool down before you gently wipe your eyelashes to clean off crusts with a clean cotton wool pad (1 piece for each eye).
Hold a cold flannel on your eyes for a few minutes to cool them down.
Do not wear contact lenses until your eyes are better.
A pharmacist can help with conjunctivitis
Speak to a pharmacist about conjunctivitis. They can give you advice and suggest eyedrops or antihistamines to help with your symptoms.
If you need treatment for a child under 2, you'll need a prescription from a GP.
Find a pharmacy"
Stop infectious conjunctivitis from spreading,"There are things you can do to stop conjunctivitis spreading to other people.
Do
wash your hands regularly with warm soapy water
wash your pillow cases and face cloths in hot water and detergent
cover your mouth and nose when sneezing and put used tissues in the bin
Don’t
do not share towels and pillows
do not rub your eyes
Staying away from work or school
You do not need to stay away from work or school unless you or your child are feeling very unwell."
Treatment from a GP,"Treatment will depend on the cause of your conjunctivitis.
If it's a bacterial infection, you might be prescribed antibiotics. But these will not work if it's caused by a virus (viral conjunctivitis) or an allergy.
Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause conjunctivitis. This type takes longer to get better."
Defining consent,"For consent to be valid, it must be voluntary and informed, and the person consenting must have the capacity to make the decision.
The meaning of these terms are:
voluntary – the decision to either consent or not to consent to treatment must be made by the person, and must not be influenced by pressure from medical staff, friends or family
informed – the person must be given all of the information about what the treatment involves, including the benefits and risks, whether there are reasonable alternative treatments, and what will happen if treatment does not go ahead
capacity – the person must be capable of giving consent, which means they understand the information given to them and can use it to make an informed decision
If an adult has the capacity to make a voluntary and informed decision to consent to or refuse a particular treatment, their decision must be respected.
This is still the case even if refusing treatment would result in their death, or the death of their unborn child.
If a person does not have the capacity to make a decision about their treatment and they have not appointed a lasting power of attorney (LPA), the healthcare professionals treating them can go ahead and give treatment if they believe it's in the person's best interests.
But clinicians must take reasonable steps to discuss the situation with the person's friends or relatives before making these decisions.
Read more about assessing the capacity to consent, which explains what someone can do if they know their capacity to consent may be affected in the future."
How consent is given,"Consent can be given:
verbally – for example, a person saying they're happy to have an X-ray
in writing – for example, signing a consent form for surgery
Someone could also give non-verbal consent, as long as they understand the treatment or examination about to take place – for example, holding out an arm for a blood test.
Consent should be given to the healthcare professional responsible for the person's treatment.
This could be a:
nurse arranging a blood test
GP prescribing new medication
surgeon planning an operation
If someone's going to have a major procedure, such as an operation, their consent should be secured well in advance so they have plenty of time to understand the procedure and ask questions.
If they change their mind at any point before the procedure, they're entitled to withdraw their previous consent."
Consent from children and young people,"If they're able to, consent is usually given by patients themselves.
But someone with parental responsibility may need to give consent for a child up to the age of 16 to have treatment.
Find out more about how the rules of consent apply to children and young people"
When consent is not needed,"There are some exceptions when treatment may be able to go ahead without the person's consent, even if they're capable of giving their permission.
It may not be necessary to obtain consent if a person:
needs emergency treatment to save their life, but they're incapacitated (for example, they're unconscious) – the reasons why treatment was necessary should be fully explained once they have recovered
immediately needs an additional emergency procedure during an operation – there has to be a clear medical reason why it would be unsafe to wait to obtain consent
with a severe mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dementia, lacks the capacity to consent to the treatment of their mental health (under the Mental Health Act) – in these cases, treatment for unrelated physical conditions still requires consent, which the patient may be able to provide, despite their mental health condition
needs hospital treatment for a severe mental health condition, but self-harmed or attempted suicide while competent and is refusing treatment (under the Mental Health Act) – the person's nearest relative or an approved social worker must make an application for the person to be forcibly kept in hospital, and 2 doctors must assess the person's condition
is severely ill and living in unhygienic conditions (under the National Assistance Act 1948) – a person who's severely ill or infirm and living in unsanitary conditions can be taken to a place of care without their consent"
Consent and life support,"A person may be being kept alive with supportive treatments, such as lung ventilation, without having made an advance decision, which outlines the care they'd refuse to receive.
In these cases, a decision about continuing or stopping treatment needs to be made based on what that person's best interests are believed to be.
To help reach a decision, healthcare professionals should discuss the issue with the relatives and friends of the person receiving the treatment.
They should consider:
what the person's quality of life will be if treatment is continued
how long the person may live if treatment is continued
whether there's any chance of the person recovering
Treatment can be stopped if there's an agreement that continuing treatment is not in the person's best interests.
The case will be referred to the courts before further action is taken if:
an agreement cannot be reached
a decision has to be made on whether to stop treatment for someone who's been in a state of impaired consciousness for a long time (usually at least 12 months)
It's important to note the difference between stopping a person's life support and taking a deliberate action to make them die. 
For example, injecting a lethal medicine would be illegal."
Complaints,"If you believe you have received treatment you did not consent to, you can make an official complaint.
Find out more about how to make a complaint"
Check if it's constipation,"It's likely to be constipation if:
you have not had a poo at least 3 times during the last week or you're pooing less often than usual
the poo is unusually large or small and is dry, hard or lumpy
you are straining or in pain when you have a poo
you feel like you haven't fully emptied your bowels
You may also have a stomach ache and feel bloated or sick.
If you're caring for someone with dementia or an older person, constipation may be easily missed. Look out for any behaviour changes such as confusion, as it might mean they are in pain or discomfort."
What causes constipation,"Constipation in adults has many possible causes. Sometimes there's no obvious reason.
The most common causes include:
not eating enough fibre, which is found in fruits, vegetables and cereals
not drinking enough fluids
not moving enough and spending long periods sitting or lying down
being less active and not exercising
often ignoring the urge to go to the toilet
changing your diet or daily routine
a side effect of medicine
stress, anxiety or depression
Constipation is common during pregnancy and after giving birth. It is also more common if you are black or if you are over 65 years old.
Constipation can also be caused by a medical condition such as diverticular disease or bowel cancer, but this is rare."
How you can treat and prevent constipation yourself,"Making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle can help treat constipation.
It's safe to try these simple measures when you're pregnant.
You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before your symptoms improve.
Make changes to your diet
To make your poo softer and easier to pass:
eat a healthy balanced diet and include fruits that contain sorbitol such as apples, apricots, grapes (and raisins), raspberries and strawberries
drink plenty of water and other fluids and avoid alcohol
gradually increase the fibre in your diet
add some wheat bran, oats or linseed to your diet
Improve your toilet routine
Keep to a regular time and place and give yourself plenty of time to use the toilet.
Do not delay if you feel the urge to poo.
To make it easier to poo, try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet. If possible, raise your knees above your hips.
Consider increasing your activity
A daily walk or run can help you poo more regularly.
Speak to a pharmacist for advice
Speak to a pharmacist if diet and lifestyle changes are not helping.
They can suggest a suitable laxative. These are medicines that help you poo more regularly.
Most laxatives work within 3 days. They should only be used for a short time.

Complications of long-term constipation,"Long-term constipation can lead to faecal impaction. This is where poo has built up in the last part of the large intestine (rectum).
The main symptom is diarrhoea, which leaks through the build-up of solid poo.
Faecal impaction may be treated with:
stronger laxatives – prescribed by a GP
a suppository – medicine you place in your bottom
a mini enema – where fluid is passed through your bottom, into your bowel
a healthcare professional removing some of the poo – this is not something you should do yourself"
Symptoms of contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis causes the skin to become itchy, blistered, dry and cracked.
Lighter skin can become red, and darker skin can become dark brown, purple or grey.
This reaction usually occurs within a few hours or days of exposure to an irritant or allergen.
Symptoms can affect any part of the body but most commonly the hands and face.

When to see a pharmacist,"Speak to a pharmacist if your contact dermatitis is troubling you.
They can recommend treatments such as emollients (moisturisers), which you rub on your skin to stop it becoming dry.
Find a pharmacy
When to see a GP
See a GP if you have persistent, recurrent or severe symptoms of contact dermatitis. They can try to identify the cause and suggest appropriate treatments.
A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) for further tests if:
the substance causing your contact dermatitis cannot be identified
your symptoms are not responding to treatment
Read about diagnosing contact dermatitis"
Causes of contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis can be caused by:
an irritant – a substance that directly damages the outer layer of skin
an allergen – a substance that causes the immune system to respond in a way that affects the skin
Contact dermatitis is most commonly caused by irritants such as soaps and detergents, solvents or regular contact with water.
Allergic contact dermatitis is less common and can be triggered by an allergic reaction to substances found in certain products, such as cosmetics, or some metals, including nickel.
Handling raw, uncooked fruit and vegetables may also trigger allergic contact dermatitis in some people.
Read about causes of contact dermatitis"
Treating contact dermatitis,"If you can successfully avoid the irritants or allergens that trigger your symptoms, your skin will eventually clear up.
However, as this is not always possible, you may also be advised to use:
emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry
topical corticosteroids – steroid ointments and creams applied to the skin to relieve severe symptoms
If you have a severe episode of contact dermatitis and it covers a large area of your skin, a doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids, but this is rare.
Read about treating contact dermatitis"
Preventing contact dermatitis,"The best way to prevent contact dermatitis is to avoid contact with the allergens or irritants that cause your symptoms.
If you cannot avoid contact, you can take steps to reduce the risk of the allergens or irritants causing symptoms, including:
cleaning your skin – if you come into contact with an allergen or irritant, rinse the affected skin with warm water and an emollient as soon as possible
using gloves to protect your hands – but take them off every now and again, as sweating can make any symptoms worse; you may find it useful to wear cotton gloves underneath rubber gloves if the rubber also irritates you
changing products that irritate your skin – check the ingredients on make-up or soap to make sure it does not contain any irritants or allergens; in some cases, you may need to contact the manufacturer or check online to get this information
applying emollients frequently and in large amounts – these keep your skin hydrated and help protect it from allergens and irritants; you could also use emollient soap substitutes rather than regular bar or liquid soaps, which can dry out your skin"
Other types of eczema,"Other types of eczema include:
atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema; it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever
discoid eczema – circular or oval patches of eczema on the skin
varicose eczema – this most often affects the lower legs; it's caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins"
What is the cornea and what does it do?,"The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball. It acts as a window to the eye.
The coloured iris and the pupil (the black dot in the centre of the iris) can be seen through the cornea.
The cornea helps to focus light rays on to the retina (the light-sensitive film at the back of the eye). This ""picture"" is then transmitted to the brain.
When the cornea is damaged, it can become less transparent or its shape can change.
This can prevent light reaching the retina and causes the picture transmitted to the brain to be distorted or unclear."
How is a transplant carried out?,"The type of cornea transplant you have will depend on which part of the cornea is damaged or how much of the cornea needs replacing.
The options include:
penetrating keratoplasty (PK) – a full-thickness transplant
deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) – replacing or reshaping the outer and middle (front) layers of the cornea
endothelial keratoplasty (EK) – replacing the deeper (back) layers of the cornea
A cornea transplant can be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed and you're awake).
The surgery usually takes less than an hour and, depending on your circumstances, you either leave hospital the same day or stay overnight. 
If surgery involves the transplantation of the outer cornea, the new outer cornea is held in place with stitches, which usually stay in for more than 12 months.
An endothelial transplant (EK) does not require stitches. It's held in place by an air bubble until a few days later, when it naturally sticks to the deep layer of the cornea."
Are there any risks?,"As with all types of surgery, there is a risk of complications resulting from a cornea transplant.
These can include the new cornea being rejected by the body, infection and further vision problems.
Most cornea transplants are successful and will work without complications for at least 10 years."
After a cornea transplant,"The recovery time for a cornea transplant depends on the type of transplant you have.
It takes about 18 months to enjoy the final results of a full-thickness transplant, although it's usually possible to provide glasses or a contact lens much earlier.
Recovery is usually faster after replacing just the outer and middle layers (DALK).
Endothelial transplants (EK) tend to have a faster recovery time of months or even weeks.
It's important to take good care of your eye to improve your chances of a good recovery.
This means not rubbing your eye and avoiding activities such as contact sports and swimming until you're told it's safe."
Cornea donation,"There is a shortage of donated corneas in the UK. Many more people would benefit from sight-saving surgery if more corneas were donated.

What you can do about corns and calluses,"Information:
If you have diabetes, heart disease or problems with your circulation, do not try to treat corns and calluses yourself.
These conditions can make foot problems more serious. See a GP or foot specialist.
Corns and calluses are not often serious.
There are some things you can try to get rid of them yourself and stop them coming back.
Do
wear thick, cushioned socks
wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole that do not rub
use soft insoles or heel pads in your shoes
soak corns and calluses in warm water to soften them
regularly use a pumice stone or foot file to remove hard skin
moisturise to help keep skin soft

Treatment for corns and calluses,"A GP can check if you have a corn or callus.
They might:
give you antibiotics if a corn or callus is infected
refer you to a foot specialist if they think you need further treatment
Treatment from a foot specialist
A foot specialist, such as a podiatrist, may be able to offer treatments such as:
cutting away the corn or callus
patches to help soften the hard skin so it can be removed
specially made soft pads or insoles to take pressure off the painful area of your foot
Referral to a podiatrist on the NHS may not be available to everyone and waiting times can be long. You can pay to see a podiatrist privately.
Find a podiatrist"
Common causes of corns or calluses,"Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or rubbing of the skin on the hands or feet.
For example, from:
wearing high heels, uncomfortable shoes or shoes that are the wrong size
not wearing socks with shoes
lifting heavy weights
playing a musical instrument"
Symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD),"The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are:
chest pain (angina)
shortness of breath
pain in your neck, shoulders, jaw or arms
feeling faint
feeling sick (nausea)
But not everyone has the same symptoms and some people may not have any before coronary heart disease is diagnosed."
Causes of coronary heart disease (CHD),"Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries.
Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma.
Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.
You're also more at risk of getting atherosclerosis if you have conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes."
Diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD),"If a doctor feels you're at risk of coronary heart disease, they may carry out a risk assessment.
They'll ask you about your medical and family history and your lifestyle, and they'll take a blood test.
Further tests may be needed to confirm coronary heart disease, including:
electrocardiogram (ECG)
echocardiogram
chest x-ray
coronary angiogram
Read more about how coronary heart disease is diagnosed."
Treating coronary heart disease (CHD),"Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks.
Treatment can include:
lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stopping smoking
medicines
angioplasty – where balloons and stents are used to treat narrow heart arteries
surgery"
Recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD),"If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty, or heart surgery, you’ll want to get back to as full a life as possible.
Advice and support is available to help you deal with aspects of your life that may have been affected by coronary heart disease.
Read more about recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease."
Preventing coronary heart disease (CHD),"You can reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease by making some simple lifestyle changes.
These include:
eating a healthy, balanced diet
being physically active
giving up smoking
controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels
Keeping your heart healthy will also have other health benefits, such as helping reduce your risk of stroke and dementia."
The heart,"The heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. It pumps blood around your body and beats approximately 70 times a minute.
After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to your lungs where it picks up oxygen.
The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart and is then pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries.
The blood returns to your heart through veins before being pumped back to your lungs again. This process is called circulation.
The heart gets its own supply of blood from a network of blood vessels on the heart's surface called coronary arteries."
CBD symptoms,"The symptoms of CBD get gradually worse over time. They are very variable and many people only have a few of them.
Symptoms can include:
difficulty controlling your limb on one side of the body (a ""useless"" hand)
muscle stiffness
shaking (tremors), jerky movements and spasms (dystonia)
problems with balance and co-ordination
slow and slurred speech
symptoms of dementia, such as memory and visual problems
slow, effortful speech
difficulty swallowing
One limb is usually affected at first, before spreading to the rest of the body. The rate at which the symptoms progress varies widely from person to person.
Read more about the symptoms of CBD."
What causes CBD?,"CBD occurs when brain cells in certain parts of the brain are damaged as a result of a build-up of a protein called tau.
The surface of the brain (cortex) is affected, as well as a deep part of the brain called the basal ganglia.
Tau occurs naturally in the brain and is usually broken down before it reaches high levels. In people with CBD, it isn't broken down properly and forms harmful clumps in brain cells.
CBD has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic links are weak and the risk to other family members is very low."
Diagnosing CBD,"There's no single test for CBD. Instead, the diagnosis is based on the pattern of your symptoms. Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease or a stroke.
You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language.
You will usually see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves).
Read more about how CBD is diagnosed."
Treatments for CBD,"As someone with CBD can be affected in many different ways, treatment and care is best provided by a team of health and social care professionals working together. Treatments may include:
medication – to improve stiffness and muscle spasms, sleep and mood, pain or memory
physiotherapy – to help with movement and balance difficulties
speech and language therapy – to help with communication and swallowing problems
occupational therapy – to improve the skills and abilities needed for daily activities at home
palliative care and advanced care planning
Read more about treatment for CBD."
Outlook,"There is currently no treatment that has been shown to stop CBD getting gradually worse, although treatments can reduce many of the symptoms.
Good care and assistance can help someone with CBD be more independent and enjoy a better quality of life, but the condition will eventually put them at risk of serious complications.
CBD usually changes very slowly. Many people find it helpful to plan ahead with their doctors (GP and specialist) to make decisions about what to do in later stages of the illness.
Difficulty swallowing can cause choking, or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
As a result of these complications, the average life expectancy for someone with CBD is around 6 to 8 years from when their symptoms start. However, this is only an average and CBD is very variable."
Information about you,"If you have CBD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register on the National Disease Registration Service website."
Conditions treated with topical corticosteroids,"Conditions widely treated with topical corticosteroids include:
eczema – such as atopic eczema
contact dermatitis – which causes symptoms such as dandruff and scaly patches on the skin
psoriasis
Topical corticosteroids cannot cure these conditions, but can help relieve the symptoms."
Who can use topical corticosteroids,"Most adults and children can use topical corticosteroids safely, but there are situations when they are not recommended.
They should not be used if:
you have infected skin, unless advised by a doctor
you have certain skin conditions, including rosacea and acne
Most topical corticosteroids are considered safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Your doctor will consider the area of skin where you need to use it, how often you'll use it and the condition of your skin. You should wash off any steroid cream applied to your breasts before feeding your baby.
Very potent topical corticosteroids are not usually prescribed for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for very young children. Sometimes you may be prescribed them under the supervision of a skincare specialist (dermatologist)."
How to use topical corticosteroids,"Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine. This will give details of how much to apply and how often.
Most people only need to use the medicine once or twice a day for 3 to 7 days. Occasionally a doctor may suggest using it less frequently over a longer period of time.
The medicine should only be applied to affected areas of skin. Gently smooth a thin layer onto your skin in the direction the hair grows. Wash your hands before and after you've applied the medicine, unless you are treating an area on your hands.
If you're using both topical corticosteroids and emollients, wait 20 to 30 minutes between using them.
Fingertip units
Sometimes, the amount of medicine you're advised to use will be given in fingertip units (FTUs).
A FTU (about 500mg) is the amount needed to squeeze a line from the tip of an adult finger to the first crease of the finger. It should be enough to treat an area of skin double the size of the flat of your hand with your fingers together.
The recommended dosage will depend on what part of the body is being treated. This is because the skin is thinner in certain parts of the body and more sensitive to the effects of corticosteroids.
For adults, the recommended FTUs to be applied in a single dose are:
0.5 FTU for genitals
1 FTU for hands, elbows or knees
1.5 FTUs for the feet, including the soles
2.5 FTUs for the face and neck
3 FTUs for the scalp
4 FTUs for a hand and arm together, or the buttocks
8 FTUs for 1 leg and foot, the chest or back
For children, the recommended FTUs will depend on their age. A GP can advise you on this."
Side effects of topical corticosteroids,"If you use them correctly, topical corticosteroids rarely have serious side effects.
The most common side effect of topical corticosteroids is a burning or stinging sensation when the medicine is applied. However, this usually improves as your skin gets used to the treatment.
Less common side effects can include:
worsening or spreading of a skin infection you already have
inflamed hair follicles (folliculitis)
thinning of the skin, which can make the affected skin more vulnerable to damage; for example, you may bruise more easily
stretch marks, which are likely to be permanent, although they'll probably become less noticeable over time
contact dermatitis, which is a skin irritation caused by a mild allergic reaction to the substances in a particular topical corticosteroid
acne, or worsening of acne
rosacea, which is a condition that causes the face to become red and flushed
changes in skin colour – this is usually more noticeable in people with dark skin
excessive hair growth on the area of skin being treated
Side effects are more likely if you're:
using a more potent corticosteroid
using it for a very long time, or over a large area
The elderly and very young are more vulnerable to side effects.
If potent or very potent topical corticosteroids are used for a long time or over a large area, there's a risk of the medicine being absorbed into the bloodstream and causing internal side effects, such as:
decreased growth in children
Cushing's syndrome
This is not a full list of all the possible side effects. For more information on side effects, see the leaflet that comes with the medicine.
If you're using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid for several weeks or more, you may be given a steroid treatment card that explains how you can reduce the risk of side effects.
If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your steroid treatment card to the doctor, dentist or pharmacist so they know that you're using topical corticosteroids.
Withdrawal side effects
If you stop using topical corticosteroids after using them continuously for a long time (usually over 12 months in adults), you may have a withdrawal reaction. These can sometimes be severe. Your doctor may advise stopping the treatment gradually to avoid this.
Withdrawal side effects can include:
redness or changes in skin colour (this may not be as noticeable on brown or black skin)
burning, stinging, itching or peeling of the skin, or oozing, open sores
a flare up of the skin condition you were treating
If you’ve been using topical corticosteroids for a long time, it’s a good idea to ask your doctor to review your treatment.
Reporting side effects
The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by the medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
Go to the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information."
Types of steroids,"Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone for skin
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops."
Side effects of steroids,"Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping (insomnia). This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Your doctor will advise you on how to gradually reduce your dose if necessary. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine suddenly can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).
Read more about the side effects of:
steroid tablets
steroid inhalers
steroid nasal sprays
steroid injections
steroid creams
You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme."
Steroid cards,"If you need to take high doses of steroids you may need to carry a blue steroid treatment card or a red steroid emergency card. Ask your doctor about these.
The blue steroid treatment card has details of your treatment and how you can reduce the risks of side effects.
The red steroid emergency card warns healthcare professionals that you're taking steroids in case you need emergency treatment.
If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue or red steroid card to the doctor, dentist or pharmacist so that they know you're taking steroids."
Uses for steroids,"Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
severe hives
eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as severe sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)"
How steroids work,"Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
Steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."
Check if you have costochondritis,"Costochondritis may cause sharp pain in the front or side of your chest.
The pain may be worse when:
moving your upper body
lying down
breathing deeply
you press the middle of your chest"
Treatments for costochondritis,"Costochondritis usually gets better on its own, over time. It can last for a few weeks to several months.
Painkillers that help with inflammation, like ibuprofen, may be recommended to help with the pain.
If you have very bad pain that does not get better over time, you may be offered a steroid injection to help reduce inflammation or local anaesthetic to ease the pain."
Causes of costochondritis,"It is not always known what causes costochondritis, but it may be caused by:
an injury to your chest
repetitive upper body movements, like lifting
coughing a lot
Sometimes it may be caused by a problem with the joints in the back, or another underlying condition like fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis.
It can also be caused by an infection."
How you can treat a cough yourself,"There's usually no need to see a GP if you have a cough.
You should:
rest
drink plenty of fluids
try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
You could also try:
paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain
hot lemon and honey (not suitable for babies under 1 year old)
a herbal medicine called pelargonium (suitable for people aged 12 or over)
But there's limited evidence to show these work. Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect to cough medicines.
How to make a hot lemon and honey drink
Information:
Some medicines and herbal treatments are not safe for everyone (for example, if you're pregnant). Always check the leaflet or speak to a pharmacist before taking them."
A pharmacist can help if you have a cough,"If you have a cough, you can ask a pharmacist about:
cough syrup
cough medicine (some cough medicines should not be given to children under 12 years old)
cough sweets
These will not stop your cough, but may help you cough less.
Decongestants and cough medicines containing codeine will not stop your cough.
Find a pharmacy"
What happens at your appointment,"To find out what's causing your cough, the GP might:
listen to your chest with a stethoscope
take a sample of any mucus you might be coughing up
order an X-ray, allergy test, or a test to see how well your lungs work
refer you to hospital to see a specialist, but this is rare"
What causes coughs,"Most coughs are caused by a cold or flu.
Other causes include:
smoking
heartburn (acid reflux)
allergies – for example, hay fever
infections like bronchitis or COVID-19
mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose
A cough is rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer."
Causes of coughing up blood,"Common causes of coughing up blood include:
a long-lasting or severe cough
a lung or airway infection like a chest infection, pneumonia or bronchitis
a problem with your airways that causes them to widen and produce more mucus (bronchiectasis)
Sometimes coughing up blood can be a sign of something more serious like a blood clot or lung cancer.
It's important to get it checked out as soon as possible."
What can counselling help with?,"Counselling can help you cope with:
a mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety or an eating disorder
an upsetting physical health condition, such as infertility
a difficult life event, such as a bereavement, a relationship breakdown or work-related stress
difficult emotions – for example, low self-esteem or anger
other issues, such as sexual identity"
What to expect from counselling,"At your appointment, you'll be encouraged to talk about your feelings and emotions with a trained therapist, who'll listen and support you without judging or criticising.
The therapist can help you gain a better understanding of your feelings and thought processes, and find your own solutions to problems. But they will not usually give advice or tell you what to do.
Counselling can take place:
face to face
in a group
over the phone
by email
online through live chat services (learn more about online tools for mental health)
You may be offered a single session of counselling, a short course of sessions over a few weeks or months, or a longer course that lasts for several months or years.
It can take a number of sessions before you start to see progress, but you should gradually start to feel better with the help and support of your therapist."
Can you get free counselling on the NHS?,"You can get free talking therapies, including counselling for depression, on the NHS.
You do not need a referral from a GP.

Check if your baby has cradle cap,"The main symptom of cradle cap is patches of greasy, scaly skin.
It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area. It can look like:
patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off
small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area
The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin.
It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby.
The cause of cradle cap is not clear, but it cannot be caught from other babies.

Things you can do to help with cradle cap,"Do
lightly massage an emollient (moisturiser) on to your baby's scalp to help loosen the scales
gently brush your baby's scalp with a soft brush and then wash it with baby shampoo
Don’t
do not use olive oil, it may not be suitable for use on skin
do not use peanut oil (because of the allergy risk)
do not use soap or adult shampoos
do not pick crusts because this can increase the chance of infection
Information:
Your baby's hair may come away with the scales. Do not worry if this happens as it will soon grow back.
A pharmacist can help with cradle cap

Check if your baby has craniosynostosis,"Babies' heads come in all shapes and sizes. It's normal for their head to be a slightly unusual shape. It will often get better as they grow.
But your baby may have a problem like craniosynostosis if:
their head is long and narrow, like a rugby ball
their forehead is pointy or triangular
one side of their head is flattened or bulging out
the soft spot on the top of their head (fontanelle) disappears before they're 1 year old
If the problem is mild, it may not be noticeable until your child is older.
Rarely, your child may have symptoms such as:
learning difficulties
sight or hearing loss
breathing problems, like not being able to breathe through their mouth
dental problems, such as missing or crowded teeth"
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP will examine your child's head. They may also take some measurements to see if it's an unusual size for your child's age.
If they think your child could have craniosynostosis, they may refer them to a specialist centre for more tests, like X-rays or scans.
These tests should help determine what type of craniosynostosis your child has, and what type of treatment they'll need as they grow older.
Types of craniosynostosis"
Treatment for craniosynostosis,"If your baby has craniosynostosis they will have regular check-ups to monitor it.
Treatment usually involves surgery. The type of treatment will depend on:
the type of craniosynostosis your baby has
their symptoms
their age
Some cases of craniosynostosis may just be monitored and not need treatment.
Surgery usually involves making a cut across the top of your child’s head, removing and reshaping the affected parts of their skull, and then fixing them back in place.
It's done under general anaesthetic (they will be asleep). Your child may need to stay in hospital for up to a week afterwards.
In some cases it may be possible to treat craniosynostosis with a less invasive procedure called an endoscopy (where a thin, flexible tube is passed through a small incision in the skull), followed by wearing a specially designed helmet.
The care team looking after your baby will talk to you about the options.
Depending on their symptoms, they may also need:
regular hearing and eye tests and sometimes glasses
speech and language therapy
specialist dental treatments
psychological counselling
further surgery as an older child or teenager"
Long-lasting effects of craniosynostosis,"Many children do not have any lasting health problems from craniosynostosis. They may have a scar across the top of their head if they had surgery, but this will be hidden by their hair.
Your child will have regular check-ups to see how they're doing. These may be every few weeks at first but will become less frequent as they get older.
If your child has certain types of craniosynostosis, surgery cannot always fully correct the shape of their head and they may need ongoing care.
Certain types of craniosynostosis can lead to long-term conditions like learning difficulties, hearing loss and problems with sight, such as having a lazy eye."
Symptoms of Crohn's disease,"Crohn's disease affects people of all ages. The symptoms usually start in childhood or early adulthood.
The main symptoms are:
diarrhoea
stomach aches and cramps
blood in your poo
tiredness (fatigue)
weight loss
The symptoms may be constant or may come and go every few weeks or months. When they come back, it's called a flare-up."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you or your child have:
blood in your poo
diarrhoea for more than 7 days
frequent stomach aches or cramps
lost weight for no reason, or your child's not growing as fast as you'd expect
A GP will try to find out what's causing your symptoms and may refer you for tests to check for Crohn's disease."
Treatments for Crohn's disease,"There's no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatment can help reduce or control your symptoms.
The main treatments are:
medicines to reduce inflammation in the digestive system – usually steroid tablets
medicines to stop the inflammation coming back – either tablets or injections
surgery to remove a small part of the digestive system – sometimes this may be a better treatment option than medicines
You'll usually have a team of health professionals helping you, possibly including a GP, a specialist nurse and specialist doctors."
Living with Crohn's disease,"Living with Crohn's disease can be difficult at times. Unpredictable flare-ups and regular check-ups with your care team can disrupt school, work and your social life.
But if symptoms are well controlled, you can live a normal life with the condition.
Support is available from your care team and organisations like Crohn's & Colitis UK if you need it."
Causes of Crohn's disease,"The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown.
It's thought several things could play a role, including:
your genes – you're more likely to get it if a close family member has it
a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against infection) that causes it to attack the digestive system
smoking
a previous stomach bug
an abnormal balance of gut bacteria
There's no evidence to suggest a particular diet causes Crohn's disease."
Check if your child has croup,"Symptoms of croup include:
a barking cough – this may sound like a seal (you can search online to hear examples)
a hoarse voice
difficulty breathing
a high pitched, rasping sound when breathing in
Your child will usually have cold-like symptoms to begin with, such as a temperature, runny nose and cough.
Croup symptoms usually come on after a few days and are often worse at night."
How to look after a child with croup at home,"Croup usually gets better on its own within 48 hours. There are things you can do to help.
Do
sit your child upright and try not to let them lie down
comfort them if they're distressed and try to keep them calm (crying can make the symptoms worse)
give them plenty of fluids
check on them regularly, including at night
give them paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease a high temperature or any discomfort
Don’t
do not put your child in a steamy room or get them to inhale steam"
Why a CT scan is done,"You may be referred for a CT scan to:
check your bones or internal organs after an accident
find out if symptoms you've been having are caused by a condition, such as cancer
see how well a treatment is working, such as checking the size of a tumour during and after cancer treatment
help doctors see inside your body during a procedure, such as taking a sample of cells (biopsy) or draining an abscess"
Preparing for a CT scan,"The hospital where you're having the CT scan will tell you if there's anything you need to do before it.
For example, you may be asked to:
follow a special diet
take certain medicines
not to eat or drink anything for several hours before the scan (fast)
not wear anything that has metal in it, such as jewellery, clothes with zips or poppers, bras or hair clips
Tell the hospital if you:
are pregnant or might be pregnant
are breastfeeding
take any medicines
have asthma
have kidney or thyroid problems
have diabetes
have any allergies or have had an allergic reaction to a dye called contrast medium before
Information:
Talk to a GP or doctor at the hospital if you're feeling anxious about having a CT scan or have a fear of small spaces (claustrophobia). They may be able to give you a medicine to help you relax.
You can also ask if you can bring someone to support you during the CT scan."
What happens during a CT scan,"A CT scan is usually done in hospital by a healthcare professional called a radiographer. It usually takes between 10 and 20 minutes.
Before the CT scan
Depending on why you're having a CT scan, you may be given a dye to help show more detail in the CT scan pictures. The dye is called contrast medium.
It can be given to you in a drink, injected into a vein, or be put in your bottom. It'll pass out of your body in your pee.
If the contrast medium is injected into your body, you may feel:
hot and flushed
like you have a metal taste in your mouth
like you're peeing, but you're not
These feelings usually pass quickly.
During the CT scan
The CT scanner is a large ring that moves around part of your body as you lie on a flat bed.
Credit:
You'll be asked to lie on a flat bed.
The radiographer will control the scanner from another room. They'll be able to hear and speak to you during the scan.
You'll need to lie still so the scanner can move over you to take clear images.
You may be asked to breathe in, out, or hold your breath during parts of the scan.
After the CT scan
If you're having the scan as an outpatient, you'll be able to go home soon after you've had the scan.
If you were given contrast medium, you may be asked to wait in the hospital for up to 30 minutes to make sure you do not have a reaction to it."
Getting your CT scan results,"It usually takes between 1 and 2 weeks for you to get your CT scan results. The images need to be looked at by a specialist called a radiologist.
The radiologist will write to the doctor who referred you for the scan. You may need a follow-up appointment to talk about your CT scan results.
If you have not heard anything after a few weeks, contact the doctor who referred you.
The doctor should talk to you about your results and explain what happens next.
Sometimes you may need other tests, depending on why you had the CT scan.
Ask to talk to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your results, or do not understand them."
Possible complications of a CT scan,"Complications of a CT scan are rare. Some people can have an allergic reaction to the contrast medium (dye). This can cause weakness, sweating and difficulty breathing.
You'll be asked to wait at the hospital for up to 30 minutes after having the scan before you can go home if you had contrast medium.
Tell the radiographer if you feel unwell after the scan.
If you have lots of CT scans, there's a very small chance the radiation from the X-rays can cause cancer. The doctors will weigh up the risks before giving you a scan and discuss this with you."
Who gets it and why,"Cushing's syndrome is uncommon. It mostly affects people who have been taking steroid medicine, especially steroid tablets, for a long time. Steroids contain a synthetic version of cortisol.
Very rarely, it can be caused by the body producing too much cortisol.
This is usually the result of:
a growth (tumour) in the pituitary gland in the brain
a tumour in 1 of the adrenal glands above the kidneys
The tumours are usually non-cancerous (benign). They're most common in young women."
Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome,"Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome can start suddenly or gradually. They tend to get slowly worse if not treated.
One of the main signs is weight gain and more body fat, such as:
increased fat on your chest and tummy, but slim arms and legs
a build-up of fat on the back of your neck and shoulders, known as a ""buffalo hump""
a red, puffy, rounded face
Other symptoms include:
skin that bruises easily
large purple stretch marks
weakness in your upper arms and thighs
a reduced sex drive (low libido) and fertility problems
depression and mood swings
Cushing's syndrome can also cause high blood pressure, which can be serious if not treated."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, especially if you're taking steroids.
Do not stop taking your medicine without getting medical advice.
Lots of things can cause similar symptoms to Cushing's syndrome, so it's a good idea to get checked to find out what the problem is."
Tests and diagnosis,"Your doctor may suspect Cushing's syndrome if you have typical symptoms and are taking steroid medicine.
If you're not taking steroids, it can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.
If Cushing's syndrome is suspected, the amount of cortisol in your body can be measured in your:
urine
blood
saliva
If these tests show a high level of cortisol, you may be referred to a specialist in hormone conditions (endocrinologist) to confirm or rule out Cushing's syndrome.
You may also need other tests or scans to find out the cause."
Treatment for Cushing's syndrome,"Cushing's syndrome usually gets better with treatment, although it might take a long time to recover completely.
Treatment depends on what's causing it.
If it's caused by taking steroids:
your steroid dose will be gradually reduced or stopped
If it's caused by a tumour, treatment may include:
surgery to remove the tumour
radiotherapy to destroy the tumour
medicines to reduce the effect of cortisol on your body
Speak to your doctor about the benefits and risks of the different treatment options."

How to treat a cut or graze yourself,"You can treat a cut or graze yourself by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound, and covering it with a plaster or dressing. This will help stop it getting infected.
If it's painful, you can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (but do not give aspirin to children under 16).
What to do if the wound is bleeding a lot
Check the wound and make sure there's nothing stuck in it.
If there's nothing in the wound, put pressure on it using a bandage or a clean, folded cloth (such as a tea towel) for 10 minutes.
If there's something stuck in the wound, do not try to take it out. Make sure not to press down on the object. Press firmly either side of it to push the edges of the wound together.
If the wound is on your hand or arm, raise it above your head. If the wound is on your lower limb, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce the blood flow.
When the bleeding has stopped, firmly wrap a new bandage over the first cloth or bandage.
If the wound keeps bleeding, leave the first bandage in place and add another one. Keep pressing firmly on the wound for another 10 minutes.
How to clean and dress a cut or graze
If the bleeding has stopped, you can clean a small wound and then put a plaster or dressing over it.
Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Put on disposable gloves if you have some.
Clean the wound by rinsing it with bottled or tap water, or by using sterile wipes.
Clean the skin around the wound using soap and water or antiseptic – but try not to get antiseptic into the wound.
Pat the area dry using a gauze swab or a clean tea towel.
Put on a sterile dressing or a plaster.
Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as you need. You can take it off after a few days, once the wound has closed."
Treatments for cuts and grazes,"How a cut or graze is treated will depend on how bad it is and if there's a risk of it becoming infected.
The cut will be cleaned and closed with either stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is put over it.
But the wound may not be closed straight away if it's infected or there's a risk it may get infected.
You may also need to have an injection to prevent tetanus or be given antibiotics if the cut could be infected."
Symptoms of CVS,"Someone with CVS will feel very sick (nauseous) and may vomit for hours or even days at a time.
They'll recover from the episode and feel well, but they'll have another episode perhaps a month later, or sometimes longer.
CVS can last for months, years or sometimes decades. The symptoms can be so severe that some people need treatment in hospital.
An episode of CVS has 4 phases:
1. Prodrome phase
During the prodrome phase, the person will:
feel an episode of vomiting is about to start
have intense sweating and nausea for a few minutes to a few hours
appear unusually pale
2. Vomiting phase
The vomiting phase involves nausea, vomiting and retching. The person may:
vomit up to 5 or 6 times in an hour, for up to 10 days
have tummy pain
be unable to talk or move
have other symptoms, including diarrhoea, a slightly high temperature, dizziness, headache, sensitivity to light, feeling sleepy, drooling or spitting excess saliva
3. Recovery phase
During the recovery phase the:
vomiting, retching and nausea stops
other symptoms improve
Recovery can take a few hours to a few days.
4. Well phase
The well phase is a period where there are no CVS symptoms.
The cycle is usually regular and predictable, with the same symptoms starting at the same time of the day or night and lasting for the same length of time."
What causes CVS,"The cause of CVS is not yet known, but there may be a link with migraine. Many people with CVS develop migraines, and migraine medicines may help treat the syndrome. 
Vomiting episodes may be triggered by:
emotional stress, such as excitement, anxiety or panic attacks
physical stress, such as an infection, exhaustion, or lack of sleep
some foods and drinks, such as chocolate, cheese, and things that contain caffeine, alcohol or MSG (monosodium glutamate)
very hot or very cold weather
periods
allergies
motion sickness
overeating, not eating for long periods (fasting), or eating just before going to bed
For some people, there is no obvious trigger."
Who's affected by CVS,"CVS is more common in children, usually starting between the age of 3 to 7. But it can also affect adults.
Children who get migraines, are sensitive to light and sound, or have a family history of migraines, may have a higher chance of getting CVS.
Children with CVS may stop getting symptoms when they get older, but sometimes CVS continues. Having CVS as a child may also lead to experiencing migraines as an adult."
Diagnosing CVS,"In children, a GP will ask about your child's symptoms and medical history. They may suspect your child has CVS if they show all these signs:
they have 3 or more intense episodes of nausea and vomiting lasting from a few hours to 10 days within a 6-month period
the episodes are at least a week apart and similar each time
your child returns to normal health between episodes
tests do not show another condition is causing the vomiting
In adults, CVS may be diagnosed if:
you've had 3 or more similar vomiting episodes in the past 12 months, at least a week apart
there's no nausea or vomiting between episodes
you do not have any other condition that could cause your symptoms
The high frequency of vomiting and the fact the episodes tend to start at the same time of day indicates CVS, rather than another condition, may be the cause.
Blood or urine tests may be done to rule out an infection or kidney problems.
Tests, such as an endoscopy or abdominal ultrasound scan, may be done to see if there's a problem with your digestive tract.
Long-term use of cannabis can cause symptoms very similar to CVS (known as cannabinoid-induced hyperemesis).
You may be referred to a doctor who specialises in the digestive system (gastroenterologist)."
Managing a vomiting episode,"When a vomiting episode starts, it's a good idea to stay in bed in a quiet, dark room and take any medicines you've been prescribed for this phase of the cycle.
Keep taking small sips of fluid, such as water or diluted squash, to prevent dehydration.
Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark yellow and strong-smelling pee.
After the vomiting episode has finished:
drink plenty of fluids
gradually start eating your normal diet again
take any medicines you've been prescribed to prevent future episodes
Medicine
You or your child may be prescribed medicine:
to prevent nausea and vomiting (an antiemetic)
for tummy (abdominal) pain, such as ibuprofen or amitriptyline
to control how much stomach acid you have, such as ranitidine or omeprazole
to treat migraines, such as sumatriptan and propranolol
Read more about the medicines used to treat migraines and medicines used to prevent migraines.
It may take a while to find a medicine, or combination of medicines, that works for you.
Hospital treatment
You or your child may need treatment in hospital if nausea and vomiting is severe.
Medicine and fluids may need to be given into a vein (intravenously) to treat symptoms and prevent dehydration. Nutrition may also be given intravenously if vomiting continues for days."
Preventing vomiting,"It may be possible to prevent or reduce vomiting episodes by:
avoiding known triggers, such as certain foods
getting enough sleep
treating any sinus problems or allergies
taking steps to manage stress and anxiety
eating small carbohydrate-based snacks between meals, before exercise and at bedtime may help prevent attacks in some people
Some medicines used to prevent migraines may also help."
Complications of CVS,"Severe vomiting and retching episodes can lead to:
dehydration
inflammation of the food pipe (oesophagitis)
a tear in the lining of the food pipe (oesophagus)
tooth decay
gastroparesis, where the stomach is not able to empty itself of food in the normal way"
Help and support,The Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK and The Migraine Trust offer information and support for people with CVS and their families.
Check if you're at risk of cyclospora,"You can get cyclospora from drinking unclean water or eating food that has not been cooked thoroughly or washed with clean water.
Cyclospora is found in parts of:
Central and South America
south and southeast Asia
the Middle East
Africa
You cannot catch it from close contact with someone who has it."
How to avoid cyclospora while travelling,"If you’re travelling to an area where cyclospora is found, there are things you can do to reduce the chances of getting it.
Do
wash your hands with soap and clean water or alcohol hand gel regularly
only drink bottled, boiled or purified water
only eat food that has been cooked thoroughly or cleaned with bottled, boiled or purified water
Don’t
do not eat raw fruit and vegetables that have not been washed in bottled, boiled or purified water
do not have ice in your drinks
do not drink tap water or use it to clean your teeth"
Symptoms of cyclospora,"Not everyone with cyclospora gets symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start about a week after getting infected.
Symptoms of cyclospora include:
diarrhoea
loss of appetite and weight loss
stomach cramps
bloating and farting
tiredness
feeling sick
muscle aches"
Treatment for cyclospora,"Cyclospora usually gets better on its own within a few days or weeks. Make sure you have lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Sometimes you may be asked to provide a sample of poo (stool sample) so it can be checked for cyclospora.
If your symptoms are severe or do not go away, you may need antibiotics."
Symptoms of cystic fibrosis,"The build-up of sticky mucus in the lungs can cause breathing problems and increases the risk of lung infections. Over time, the lungs may stop working properly.
Mucus also clogs the pancreas (the organ that helps with digestion), which stops enzymes reaching food in the gut and helping with digestion.
This means most people with cystic fibrosis don't absorb nutrients from food properly and need to eat more calories to avoid malnutrition.
Symptoms of cystic fibrosis include:
recurring chest infections
wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and damage to the airways (bronchiectasis)
difficulty putting on weight and growing
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
diarrhoea, constipation, or large, smelly poo
a bowel obstruction in newborn babies (meconium ileus) – surgery may be needed
People with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including diabetes, thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis), infertility in males, and liver problems."
Diagnosing cystic fibrosis,"In the UK, all newborn babies are screened for cystic fibrosis as part of the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test) carried out shortly after they're born.
If the screening test suggests a child may have cystic fibrosis, they'll need these additional tests to confirm they have the condition:
a sweat test – to measure the amount of salt in sweat, which will be abnormally high in someone with cystic fibrosis
a genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis
These tests can also be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis in older children and adults who didn't have the newborn test.
The genetic test can also be used to see whether someone is a ""carrier"" of cystic fibrosis in cases where the condition runs in the family.
This test can be important for someone who thinks they may have the faulty gene and wishes to have children.
The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has more information about genetic testing for cystic fibrosis."
Treatments for cystic fibrosis,"There's no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a range of treatments can help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with.
People with cystic fibrosis may need to take different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems.
Physical activity and the use of airway clearance techniques may also be recommended to help clear mucus from the lungs.
Find out more about treatments for cystic fibrosis."
Complications of cystic fibrosis,"People with cystic fibrosis also have a higher risk of developing other conditions.
These include:
weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) – medicines called bisphosphonates can sometimes help
diabetes – insulin and a special diet may be needed to control blood sugar levels
nasal polyps and sinus infections – steroids, antihistamines, antibiotics or sinus flushes can help
liver problems
fertility problems – it's possible for women with cystic fibrosis to have children, but men won't be able to father a child without help from fertility specialists (see a doctor or fertility specialist for more advice)
People with cystic fibrosis should not meet face to face. This is because they're more likely to spread infections, and more vulnerable to complications if they do develop an infection.
The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has more information about complications of cystic fibrosis and preventing cross-infection."
Cause of cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition. It's caused by a faulty gene that affects the movement of salt and water in and out of cells.
This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways – particularly the lungs and digestive system.
A person with cystic fibrosis is born with the condition. It's not possible to ""catch"" cystic fibrosis from someone else who has it.
How cystic fibrosis is inherited
To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents.
This can happen if the parents are ""carriers"" of the faulty gene, which means they don't have cystic fibrosis themselves.
It's estimated around 1 in every 25 people in the UK are carriers of cystic fibrosis.
If both parents are carriers, there's a:
1 in 4 chance their child won't inherit any faulty genes and won't have cystic fibrosis or be able to pass it on
1 in 2 chance their child will inherit a faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier
1 in 4 chance their child will inherit the faulty gene from both parents and have cystic fibrosis
If one parent has cystic fibrosis and the other is a carrier, there's a:
1 in 2 chance their child will be a carrier
1 in 2 chance their child will have cystic fibrosis"
Outlook,"Cystic fibrosis tends to get worse over time and can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly.
But people with cystic fibrosis are now living for longer because of advancements in treatment.
Currently, about half of people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this."
Support,"Support is available to help people with cystic fibrosis live as independently as they can and have the best possible quality of life.
It can be helpful to speak to others who have the same condition, and to connect with a charity.
The following links may be useful:
Asthma + Lung UK – the UK's lung health charity
Cystic Fibrosis Trust – which has an online forum and news about ongoing research into cystic fibrosis
CF Kids – a support group for parents of children with cystic fibrosis

Information about you
If you or your child has cystic fibrosis, your clinical team will ask you if you consent to being on the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry.
This is a secure anonymous registry sponsored by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust that records health information on people with cystic fibrosis.
The registry helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Check if it's cystitis,"Symptoms of cystitis include:
pain, burning or stinging when you pee
needing to pee more often and urgently than usual
pee that's dark, cloudy or strong smelling
pain low down in your tummy
Symptoms in young children may also include:
a high temperature – they feel hotter than usual if you touch their neck, back or tummy
wetting themselves
reduced appetite and being sick
weakness and irritability
In older, frail people with cognitive impairment (such as dementia) and people with a urinary catheter, symptoms may also include:
changes in behaviour, such as acting confused or agitated (delirium)
wetting themselves more than usual
shivering or shaking (rigors)"
Treatment from a GP,"If you have cystitis, a GP may:
offer self-care advice and recommend taking a painkiller
do a urine test, although this is not always needed
give you a prescription for a 3-day course of antibiotics
give you a prescription for antibiotics but suggest you wait for 48 hours before taking them, in case your symptoms go away on their own
Treatment for cystitis that keeps coming back
If you keep getting cystitis, a GP may prescribe:
a single-dose antibiotic to take within 2 hours of having sex, if you've noticed sex triggers cystitis
a low-dose antibiotic to take for up to 6 months
a vaginal oestrogen cream, if you have gone through the menopause
In some women, antibiotics do not work or urine tests do not pick up an infection even though you have cystitis symptoms.
This may mean you have a long-term (chronic) bladder infection that is not picked up by current urine tests. Ask the GP for a referral to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
Long-term infections are linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer in people aged 60 and over."
Things you can try yourself,"If you have mild symptoms of cystitis, it can help to:
take paracetamol up to 4 times a day to reduce pain
give children paracetamol – follow the instructions on the bottle
drink plenty of water
hold a hot water bottle over your lower tummy
avoid having sex
avoid drinks that may irritate your bladder, like fruit juices, coffee and alcohol
pee frequently
Some people take cystitis sachets or cranberry drinks and products every day to prevent cystitis from happening, which might help. However, there’s no evidence they help ease symptoms or treat cystitis if the infection has already started.
A pharmacist can help with cystitis
You can ask a pharmacist about treatments for cystitis. A pharmacist can:
offer advice on things that can help you get better
suggest the best painkiller to take
tell you if you need to see a GP about your symptoms
Some pharmacies offer a cystitis management service. They may be able to give antibiotics if they're needed.
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of cystitis,"Cystitis is usually caused by bacteria from poo getting into the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra).
Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder and cause an infection.
Things that increase the chance of bacteria getting into the bladder include:
having sex
wiping your bottom from back to front after going to the toilet
urinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
using spermicide with contraception
conditions that block the urinary tract, such as kidney stones
being pregnant
conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder, such as an enlarged prostate gland in men
having been through the menopause
having diabetes
having a weakened immune system"
How to prevent cystitis,"If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try to help prevent it returning.
Do
wipe from front to back when you go to the toilet
pee as soon as possible after sex
drink plenty of fluids, especially water – so that you pee regularly during the day and do not feel thirsty
have a shower rather than a bath – this stops exposing your genitals to cleaning products for too long
wash the skin outside the vagina (vulva) with water before and after sex
change soiled nappies or incontinence pads promptly
keep the genital area clean and dry
Don’t
do not use scented soap, bubble bath or talcum powder
do not use spermicide with diaphragm or condoms – try non-spermicidal lube or different type of contraception
do not hold your pee in if you feel the urge to go
do not rush when going for a pee – try to fully empty your bladder
do not drink lots of alcoholic drinks or coffee – they may irritate your bladder
do not have lots of sugary foods or drinks – they may encourage bacteria to grow
Other ways to prevent cystitis coming back
If you keep getting cystitis, there is some evidence you may find it helpful to take:
D-mannose – a sugar you can buy as a powder or tablets to take every day
cranberry products – available as juice, tablets or capsules to take every day
Be aware that D-mannose and cranberry products can contain a lot of sugar. If you're taking warfarin, you should avoid cranberry products."
Symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV),"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) does not usually cause any symptoms and most people do not realise they have it.
Some people get flu-like symptoms the first time they get CMV, including:
a high temperature
aching muscles
tiredness
a skin rash
feeling sick
a sore throat
swollen glands
They usually get better without treatment within about 3 weeks."
Complications of cytomegalovirus (CMV),"When a baby is born with a CMV infection, it's known as congenital CMV.
Most babies with congenital CMV do not have any symptoms.
But congenital CMV can sometimes cause problems, including:
a rash
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
a low birth weight
a smaller head than usual (microcephaly)
seizures (fits)
hearing problems in 1 or both ears
problems with the eyes
problems with the liver and spleen
Babies born with congenital CMV may have tests to check their kidneys, liver, brain, eyes and hearing, and regular follow-up appointments until they're around 5 years old."
How cytomegalovirus (CMV) is spread,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is mainly spread through close contact with someone who already has it.
You can pass it on through contact with body fluids, including saliva, blood, breast milk, pee and poo, and through sex.
CMV can only be passed on when it's active. The virus is active when:
you get CMV for the first time – young children often get CMV for the first time at nursery
the virus has reactivated because you have a weakened immune system
you've been reinfected with a different type (strain) of CMV
Congenital CMV is caused by passing on an active CMV infection to your unborn baby during pregnancy."
Treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV),"If cytomegalovirus (CMV) is not causing symptoms, you or your baby may not need any treatment.
There's currently no treatment for CMV in pregnancy, but in most cases the virus does not cause any problems.
Antiviral medicine may be used to treat:
babies diagnosed with congenital CMV after they're born
people with a weakened immune system
people who have had a stem cell transplant or organ transplant
Treatment weakens the virus and lowers the chance of serious problems, but it does not cure the CMV infection."
Things you can do to lower the chance of getting cytomegalovirus (CMV) in pregnancy,"The best way to lower the chance of getting cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy is to:
wash your hands using soap and water – especially after changing nappies, feeding young children or wiping their nose
regularly wash toys or other items that may have young children's saliva or pee on them
avoid sharing food, cutlery and drinking glasses, or putting a child's dummy in your mouth
avoid kissing young children on their mouth
There's currently no vaccine for CMV.
Important
Pregnant women who work closely with children or already have a young family are more at risk of getting CMV."
Check if it's dandruff,"Dandruff causes white or grey flakes of skin to appear on the scalp and in the hair.
Credit:
The flakes are often more noticeable in darker hair and if they fall from your scalp onto your shoulders.
Your scalp may also feel dry and itchy."
How to treat dandruff yourself,"Use an anti-dandruff shampoo to treat dandruff. There are several different types you can buy from pharmacies or supermarkets.
Look for a shampoo that contains 1 of these ingredients:
zinc pyrithione
salicylic acid
selenium sulphide (or selenium sulfide)
ketoconazole
coal tar
A pharmacist can tell you how to use the shampoo.
Use the shampoo for a month to see if your dandruff gets better. You might need to try more than 1 type to find a shampoo that works for you.
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of dandruff,"Dandruff is not caused by poor hygiene, although it may be more obvious if you do not wash your hair regularly.
Stress and cold weather may also make dandruff worse.
A list of conditions that cause dandruff and their main symptoms.
Symptoms Possible causes
Scaly, itchy and red patches on skin on scalp, face and other areas of the body Seborrheic dermatitis
Red or silver rash on scalp, sometimes with patchy hair loss Tinea capitis, known as ringworm
Dry, red, flaky and very itchy skin on areas of the body Eczema
Red, irritated skin, may also have blisters and cracked skin; reaction to products such as hair dye, sprays, gels or mousses Contact dermatitis
Red, flaky, crusty and sore patches of skin covered with silvery scales Psoriasis
Greasy, yellowish crusts on baby's scalp, eyebrows and nappy area Cradle cap"
Signs of deafblindness,"Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children.
In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first.
Signs of a problem can include:
needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio
difficulty following a conversation
not hearing noises such as a knock at the door
asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly
needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television
difficulty moving around unfamiliar places
If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it's important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too.
Read more about the symptoms of deafblindness."
Seeing your GP,"Visit your GP if you think your hearing or eyesight may be getting worse.
If you're worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP.
It's best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness can be more effective if started early. Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner.
Read more about diagnosing and assessing deafblindness."
What causes deafblindness?,"There are many potential causes of deafblindness. Some babies are born deafblind, but in many cases the hearing and/or vision loss occurs later in life.
Causes of deafblindness include:
age-related hearing loss
genetic conditions, such as Usher syndrome – read more about Usher syndrome from Sense
an infection in a baby in the womb, such as rubella (german measles)
cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination
eye problems associated with increasing age, such as cataracts
Read more about the causes of deafblindness."
Living with deafblindness,"A range of care and support services is available to help deafblind people.
Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they'll have their own individual care needs.
The general aims of care for a deafblind person are to:
preserve and maximise any remaining sight or hearing the person has – this could involve treating underlying conditions like cataracts, wearing glasses or using a hearing aid or implant
teach alternative methods of communication – such as hands-on signing or braille
help retain or develop as much independence as possible – for example, by training the person to use a long cane, a guide dog or offering a communicator guide
Your local authority should arrange an assessment to determine exactly what care and support is needed.
Read more about managing deafblindness."
Help and support,"Sense is a UK-based charity that provides advice and support for deafblind people. The Sense helpline number is 0300 330 9256 (same number for textphone). Alternatively, you can email Sense: info@sense.org.uk.
Deafblind UK is another national charity that supports deafblind people and those with progressive sight and hearing loss.
You can call Deafblind UK's helpline for information and advice on 0800 132320 or text on 07903 572885. You can also email Deafblind UK: info@deafblind.org.uk."
Signs of hearing loss,"It's not always easy to tell if you're losing your hearing.
Common signs include:
difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in noisy places
asking people to repeat themselves
listening to music or watching TV with the volume higher than other people need
difficulty hearing on the phone
finding it hard to keep up with a conversation
feeling tired or stressed from having to concentrate while listening
Sometimes someone else might notice problems with your hearing before you do.
Hearing loss can affect a child's speech development and progress at school."
Causes of hearing loss,"There are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent.
Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice.
Common causes of hearing loss and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Gradual hearing loss in both ears Aging or damage from loud noise over many years
Difficulty hearing in 1 ear, earache, a feeling of pressure in your ear, discharge coming out of the ear Ear infection
Difficulty hearing in 1 ear, itchiness, feeling like your ear is blocked Earwax build-up
Sudden hearing loss after an ear infection, a very loud noise or a change in air pressure (for example, from flying) Perforated eardrum
Sudden hearing loss along with dizziness, a spinning sensation (vertigo) or ringing in your ears (tinnitus) Labyrinthitis or Ménière's disease"
Treatments for hearing loss,"Treatment for hearing loss depends on what's causing it.
Sometimes a GP may be able to treat the cause, for example:
an ear infection might be treated with antibiotics
an earwax build-up might be treated with ear drops or removed
If your hearing loss is not caused by something a GP can treat, they may refer you to a hearing specialist for further tests and treatment.
Hearing aids and implants
If you have permanent hearing loss, a specialist will often recommend hearing aids. These will not make your hearing perfect, but they make sounds louder and clearer.
Some people may need a hearing implant. These are devices that are attached to your skull or placed deep inside your ear."
Things you can do if you have hearing loss,"If you have hearing loss, there are things you can do to help you communicate with others and avoid more damage to your hearing.
Do
reduce background noise or move to a quieter area when talking to other people
face people when they're talking to you, so you can see their mouth, facial expressions and gestures
ask people to repeat themselves, speak more slowly or write things down if you need to
wear ear protection when exposed to loud noises
Don’t
do not listen to music too loudly – the volume should be just high enough for you to hear it comfortably
do not put your fingers or any objects like cotton buds in your ears, even if you think they might be blocked"
Types of decongestants,"Decongestants are available as:
nasal sprays
drops
tablets or capsules
liquids or syrups
flavoured powders to dissolve in hot water
Some products may just contain decongestant medicine, but many are sold as ""all-in-1"" remedies that contain decongestants, painkillers or antihistamines.
Most decongestants can be bought over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription."
Who can take decongestants,"Most people can use decongestants safely, but they're not suitable for everyone.
They should not be used by the following groups of people without getting advice from a pharmacist or GP first:
people taking other medicines
people with diabetes
people with high blood pressure
people with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)
men with an enlarged prostate
people with liver, kidney, heart or circulation problems
people with increased pressure in the eye glaucoma
Babies and children
Decongestants should not be given to children under 6 years of age.
Children aged 6 to 11 should take them for no longer than 5 days. Ask a pharmacist for advice about this.
Always follow the instructions that come with the packet.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women
It's not clear whether it's safe to take any type of decongestant if you're pregnant, so you should only use them if told to by a healthcare professional.
Decongestants that come as tablets, liquids or powders that you swallow are not recommended if you're breastfeeding.
Some decongestants that come as nose sprays or drops are safe to use if you're breastfeeding, but check with a pharmacist or GP first before using them.
The patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine will say who should not use it and who should get advice before using it."
How to use decongestants,"Most decongestants should only be used between 1 and 4 times a day.
Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for advice about how much to take and how often to take it.
If you're not sure, ask a pharmacist for advice.
Decongestant nasal sprays and drops should not be used for more than a week at a time because using them for too long can make your stuffiness worse.
Speak to a GP if your symptoms do not improve after this time."
Side effects of decongestants,"Decongestant medicines do not usually have side effects, and any side effects you may experience are usually mild.
Possible side effects can include:
feeling sleepy (look for non-drowsy medicines)
irritation of the lining of your nose
headaches
feeling or being sick
a dry mouth
feeling restless or agitated
a rash
These side effects should go away once you stop taking the medicine.
More serious side effects can also happen, such as hallucinations and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), but these are very rare."
Taking decongestants with other medicines,"Ask a pharmacist or GP before taking decongestants if you're taking other medicines.
Decongestants can increase or decrease the effect of some other medicines.
For example, taking decongestants alongside some antidepressants can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure.
It's also important to be careful when taking other medicines if you're using an ""all-in-1"" decongestant remedy.
""All-in-1"" decongestants also contain painkillers or antihistamines, so it could be dangerous to take extra doses of these medicines at the same time."
Check if you're dehydrated,"Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:
feeling thirsty
dark yellow, strong-smelling pee
peeing less often than usual
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
feeling tired
a dry mouth, lips and tongue
sunken eyes
Signs of dehydration in a baby may include:
a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on top of their head
sunken eyes
few or no tears when they cry
not having many wet nappies
being drowsy or irritable"
Causes of dehydration,"Dehydration can happen more easily if you:
have diabetes
have been sick or have diarrhoea
have been in the sun too long (heatstroke)
have drunk too much alcohol
sweat a lot after exercising
have a high temperature
take medicines that make you pee more (diuretics)"
Things you can do to treat dehydration,"You should drink fluids if you have symptoms of dehydration.
If you feel sick or have been sick, you may find it hard to drink, so start with small sips and then gradually drink more.
A pharmacist can help with dehydration
If you're being sick or have diarrhoea and are losing too much fluid, you need to put back the sugar, salts and minerals your body has lost.
A pharmacist can recommend oral rehydration solutions. These are powders that you mix with water and then drink.
Ask your pharmacist which rehydration solutions are right for you or your child.
Find a pharmacy"
Keeping your child hydrated,"Once dehydration has been treated, it's important that your child's fluid levels are maintained.
Do
carry on breastfeeding your baby or using formula – try to give small amounts more often than usual
give your baby small sips of extra water if they’re on formula or solid foods
give regular small sips of rehydration solution to replace lost fluids – ask your pharmacist to recommend one
give small children their usual diet
Don’t
do not make formula weaker
do not give young children fruit juice or fizzy drinks – it can make diarrhoea or vomiting worse"
How to reduce the risk of dehydration,"Drinking fluids regularly can reduce the risk of dehydration. Water or diluted squash are good choices.
You should drink enough during the day, so your pee is a pale clear colour.
Drink more when there's a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you're being sick, sweating due to hot weather or exercise, or you have diarrhoea.
Children under the age of 5 should get plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Helping someone you care for
A person you care for may not have a sense of how much they're drinking.
You can help them by:
making sure they drink at mealtimes
making drinking a social thing, like ""having a cup of tea""
offering them food with a high water content – for example, soup, ice cream, jelly and fruits like melon"
Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia,"Signs of frontotemporal dementia can include:
personality and behaviour changes – acting inappropriately or impulsively, appearing selfish or unsympathetic, neglecting personal hygiene, overeating, or loss of motivation
language problems – speaking slowly, struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word, getting words in the wrong order, or using words incorrectly
problems with mental abilities – getting distracted easily, struggling with planning and organisation
memory problems – these only tend to occur later on, unlike more common forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease
There may also be physical problems, such as slow or stiff movements, loss of bladder or bowel control (usually not until later on), muscle weakness or difficulty swallowing.
These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult, and the person may eventually be unable to look after themselves.
Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia."
Getting medical advice,"See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest you go with them.
The GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed.
Read more about getting a dementia diagnosis."
Tests for frontotemporal dementia,"There's no single test for frontotemporal dementia.
The following may be needed to make a diagnosis:
an assessment of symptoms – it's normally helpful to have somebody who knows the person well to give an account of their symptoms, especially as someone with frontotemporal dementia may not be aware of changes in their behaviour
an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve a number of tasks and questions
blood tests – to rule out conditions with similar symptoms
brain scans – such as an MRI scan, a CT scan or a PET scan; these can detect signs of dementia and help identify which parts of the brain are most affected, or help rule out other problems with the brain
lumbar puncture – to test the spinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spine); this may be useful to rule out Alzheimer's disease as the cause of symptoms
Read more about the tests used to diagnose dementia."
Treatments for frontotemporal dementia,"There's currently no cure for frontotemporal dementia or any treatment that will slow it down.
But there are treatments that can help control some of the symptoms, possibly for several years.
Treatments include:
medicines – to control some of the behavioural problems
therapies – such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy for problems with movement, everyday tasks and communication
dementia activities – such as memory cafes, which are drop-in sessions for people with memory problems and their carers to get support and advice
support groups – who can offer tips on managing symptoms from dementia experts and people living with frontotemporal dementia, and their families
Read more about how frontotemporal dementia is treated."
Outlook for frontotemporal dementia,"How quickly frontotemporal dementia gets worse varies from person to person and is very difficult to predict.
People with the condition can become socially isolated as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or may behave in rude or insulting ways.
Home-based help will usually be needed at some stage, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home.
The average survival time after symptoms start is around 8 to 10 years. But this is highly variable and some people live much longer than this.
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember you're not alone. The NHS and social services, as well as voluntary organisations and specialist support groups, can provide advice and support for you and your family.
Read more about looking after someone with dementia."
Causes of frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia is caused by clumps of abnormal protein forming inside brain cells. These are thought to damage the cells and stop them working properly.
The proteins mainly build up in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain at the front and sides. These are important for controlling language, behaviour, and the ability to plan and organise.
It's not fully understood why this happens, but there's often a genetic link. People who get frontotemporal dementia may have relatives who were also affected by the condition.
If you have a family history of frontotemporal dementia, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about being referred to a geneticist and possibly having a genetic test to see if you're at risk.
There's a lot of research being done to try to improve understanding of the causes of frontotemporal dementia so treatments can be discovered.
If you're interested in helping with research, you can speak to a doctor or register your interest on the Join Dementia Research website."
Other names for frontotemporal dementia,"Doctors sometimes use different names to describe frontotemporal dementia. These include:
FTD
Pick's disease
frontal dementia
frontotemporal lobar degeneration
behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia
primary progressive aphasia
semantic dementia
progressive non-fluent aphasia"

Symptoms of vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia can start suddenly or begin slowly over time.
Symptoms include:
slowness of thought
difficulty with planning and understanding
problems with concentration
changes to your mood, personality or behaviour
feeling disoriented and confused
difficulty walking and keeping balance
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, such as problems with memory and language (many people with vascular dementia also have Alzheimer's disease)
These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult and someone with the condition may eventually be unable to look after themselves."
Getting medical advice,"See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia, especially if you're over 65 years of age.
If it's found at an early stage, treatment may be able to stop vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow it down.
If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest that you go with them.
Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms. They can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed.
Find out more about how to get a dementia diagnosis."
Tests for vascular dementia,"There's no single test for vascular dementia.
The tests that are needed to make a diagnosis include:
an assessment of symptoms – for example, whether these are typical symptoms of vascular dementia
a full medical history, including asking about a history of conditions related to vascular dementia, such as strokes or high blood pressure
an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve several tasks and questions
a brain scan, such as an MRI scan or CT scan, to look for any changes that have happened in your brain
Find out more about the tests used to diagnose dementia."
Treatments for vascular dementia,"There's currently no cure for vascular dementia and there's no way to reverse any loss of brain cells that happened before the condition was diagnosed.
But treatment can sometimes help slow down vascular dementia.
Treatment aims to tackle the underlying cause, which may reduce the speed at which brain cells are lost.
This will often involve:
eating a healthy, balanced diet
losing weight if you're overweight
stopping smoking
getting fit
cutting down on alcohol
taking medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots
Other treatments, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dementia activities (such as memory cafes) and psychological therapies, can help reduce the impact of any existing problems."
Outlook for vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia will usually get worse over time. This can happen in sudden steps, with periods in between where the symptoms do not change much, but it's difficult to predict when this will happen.
Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home.
Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy.
But this is highly variable, and many people live for several years with the condition, or die from some other cause.
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you're not alone. The NHS and social services, as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family."
Causes of vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. 
This can happen as a result of:
narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels inside the brain
a single stroke, where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off
lots of ""mini strokes"" (also called transient ischaemic attacks, or TIAs) that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain
In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight.
Tackling these might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced."

Symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies,"People with dementia with Lewy bodies may have:
hallucinations and hearing voices – seeing, hearing or smelling things that are not there
problems with understanding, thinking, memory and judgement – this is similar to Alzheimer's disease, although memory may be less affected in people with dementia with Lewy bodies
confusion or sleepiness – this can change over minutes or hours
slow movement, stiff limbs and tremors (uncontrollable shaking)
disturbed sleep, often with violent movements and shouting out
fainting spells, unsteadiness and falls
depression and anxiety

These deposits are also found in people with Parkinson's disease, and they build up in areas of the brain responsible for functions such as thinking, visual perception and muscle movement.
It's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain. It's thought that part of the problem is the proteins affecting the brain's normal functions by interfering with signals sent between brain cells.
Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been very rare cases that seem to run in families."

Check if you're at risk of dengue,"You can get dengue if you're bitten by an infected mosquito. The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus bite during the day.
Dengue is very common in certain parts of the world.
It's often found in tropical areas including:
parts of Africa and Asia
Central and South America
the Caribbean
the Pacific islands
some southern areas of North America
There's also a risk of getting dengue at certain times of the year (spring to November) in parts of southern Europe.
European countries where dengue has been found include:
Croatia
France
Italy
Spain
Portugal and Madeira
Dengue is not found in the UK and you cannot catch it from another person."
Symptoms of dengue,"Dengue does not always cause symptoms.
If you do have symptoms, they usually start 4 to 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
Some dengue symptoms are similar to flu.
They include:
a high temperature
a severe headache
pain behind your eyes
muscle and joint pain
feeling or being sick
swollen glands
a blotchy rash made up of flat or slightly raised spots – this can affect large areas of your body"
Severe dengue,"Some people get a more severe type of dengue a few days after they first started feeling ill, but this is rare.
You may start to feel better with your temperature returning to normal, but about 24 to 48 hours later you may get more serious symptoms.
Symptoms of severe dengue include:
severe tummy pain
repeatedly being sick
fast breathing
bleeding gums or nose
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
being unable to relax (restlessness)
blood in your vomit or poo"
Treatments for dengue,"Most people with dengue feel better in a few days.
There is no treatment for dengue, but you can help ease your symptoms by:
resting
drinking plenty of fluids
taking paracetamol to help bring down your temperature and ease any pain
Do not take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen or aspirin. These can cause bleeding problems if you have dengue.
If you have severe dengue, you'll need to stay in hospital until you recover."
How to prevent dengue,"There's no vaccine available in the UK that you can have to prevent dengue before travelling to a country where there's a risk of infection.
If you're at increased risk of dengue, you should avoid travelling to countries where the infection is found.
At-risk groups include those who:
are very young
are over 65
are pregnant
have a weakened immune system
If you’re in a country where dengue is found, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Do
wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs, particularly during early morning and early evening
use insect repellent on your skin (ideally one that contains the ingredient DEET)
close windows and doors whenever possible, or use blinds or screens
sleep under a mosquito net treated with insecticide, including during the day"
Check if you have a dental abscess,"Signs of a dental abscess include:
intense toothache or pain in your gums
redness inside the mouth, or outside the mouth on the face or jaw
sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink in the affected area
a bad taste in your mouth
difficulty opening your mouth and chewing food
a swollen face or jaw
a high temperature"
How to ease the pain caused by a dental abscess,"There are some things you can do to help with the pain until you can get dental treatment.
Do
take painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (children under 16 should not take aspirin)
eat soft foods like soup, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes and yoghurt
use a soft toothbrush to clean your teeth
avoid having sugary, or very hot or cold, foods and drinks"
Treatment for a dental abscess,"Dental abscesses are usually treated by a dentist. The dentist will drain away the pus.
If a problem with your tooth has caused the abscess, you may need root canal treatment, or the tooth may be removed. You'll be given a local anaesthetic, so you do not feel any pain.
You may be offered painkillers to take for a few days after treatment and may also be given antibiotics."
Causes of a dental abscess,"Dental abscesses usually happen when pus builds up beneath your teeth or gums when you have an infection in your mouth.
You may get a dental abscess if:
you have a tooth that has not grown out of your gums properly (an impacted tooth)
you have tooth decay or gum disease
you have injured your teeth, gums or mouth
you're having radiotherapy or chemotherapy"
How to prevent dental abscesses,"There are some things you can do to help prevent dental abscesses.
Do
brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day - spit after brushing, do not rinse
clean in between your teeth every day using floss or interdental brushes
replace your toothbrush every 1 to 3 months
have regular dental check-ups so problems can be spotted early
Don’t
do not use mouthwash straight after brushing your teeth
do not smoke"
How to ease toothache while waiting for an appointment,"Do
take painkillers, like ibuprofen or paracetamol (children under 16 should not take aspirin) – a pharmacist can advise you
try rinsing your mouth with salt water (children should not try this)
use a pain-relieving gel for your mouth – this can be bought from pharmacies or supermarkets
eat soft foods, like yoghurt or scrambled eggs, and try to avoid chewing with the sore tooth
Don’t
do not eat foods that are sweet, very hot or very cold
do not smoke – it can make some dental problems worse
How to rinse with salt water"
Causes of toothache,"Toothache can be caused by:
tooth decay
a dental abscess
a cracked or damaged tooth
a loose or broken filling
an infection – this often happens when a tooth (such as a wisdom tooth) has broken the skin, but does not have enough room to fully come through
problems with your braces"
How to prevent toothache,"The best way to prevent toothache is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.
To do this:
have regular dental check-ups
cut down on sugary foods and drinks – only have them as an occasional treat at mealtimes
brush your teeth twice a day for about 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste
clean between your teeth using floss or an interdental brush every day to remove food, debris and plaque"
How dentures are fitted,"Complete dentures
A full denture will be fitted if all your upper or lower teeth need to be removed or you're having an old complete denture replaced.
The denture will usually be fitted as soon as your teeth are removed, which means you won't be without teeth. The denture will fit snugly over your gums and jawbone.
But if you have dentures fitted immediately after the removal of several teeth, the gums and bone will alter in shape fairly quickly and the dentures will probably need relining or remaking after a few months.
Occasionally, your gums may need to be left to heal and alter in shape for several months before dentures can be fitted.
You can either see a dentist or a qualified clinical dental technician to have your dentures made and fitted.
The difference between them is that a:
dentist will take measurements and impressions (moulds) of your mouth, and then order your full or partial dentures from a dental technician
clinical dental technician will provide a full set of dentures directly without you having to see your dentist (although you should still have regular dental check-ups with your dentist)
A trial denture will be created from the impressions taken of your mouth.
The dentist or clinical dental technician will try this in your mouth to assess the fit and for you to assess the appearance.
The shape and colour may be adjusted before the final denture is produced.
Partial dentures
A partial denture is designed to fill in the gaps left by one or more missing teeth. It's a plastic, nylon or metal plate with a number of false teeth attached to it.
It usually clips onto some of your natural teeth via metal clasps, which hold it securely in place in your mouth. It can easily be unclipped and removed.
Occasionally, the clips can be made of a tooth- or gum-coloured material, although this type of clip isn't always suitable because it tends to be more brittle than metal.
Your dentist can measure your mouth and order a partial denture for you, or you can see a qualified clinical dental technician, who can provide a partial denture for you directly after you have first seen your dentist for a treatment plan and certificate of oral health.
The Oral Health Foundation website has more information and advice about bridges and partial dentures, including which type of denture (metal or plastic) is best for you.
A fixed bridge is an alternative to a partial denture and may be suitable for some people.
Crowns are put on the teeth either side of the gap and joined together by a false tooth that's put in the gap."
Looking after your dentures,"Dentures may feel a bit strange to begin with, but you'll soon get used to wearing them.
At first, you may need to wear your dentures all the time, including while sleeping.
Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you on whether you should remove your dentures before you go to sleep.
It isn't always necessary to remove your dentures at night, but doing so can allow your gums to rest as you sleep. 
If you remove your dentures, they should be kept moist – for example, in water or a polythene bag with some dampened cotton wool in it, or in a suitable overnight denture-cleaning solution.
This will stop the denture material drying out and changing shape.
Dental hygiene
Keeping your mouth clean is just as important when you wear dentures.
You should brush your remaining teeth, gums and tongue every morning and evening with fluoride toothpaste to prevent tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems.
Read more about how to keep your teeth clean.
Cleaning dentures
It's important to regularly remove plaque and food deposits from your dentures.
This is because unclean dentures can also lead to problems, such as bad breath, gum disease, tooth decay and oral thrush.
Clean your dentures as often as you would normal teeth (at least twice a day: every morning and night).
You should:
brush your dentures with toothpaste or soap and water before soaking them to remove food particles
soak them in a fizzy solution of denture-cleaning tablets to remove stains and bacteria (follow the manufacturer's instructions)
brush them again as you would your normal teeth (but don't scrub them too hard)
Dentures may break if you drop them, so you should clean them over a bowl or sink filled with water, or something soft like a folded towel.
Find more information on denture cleaning, on the Oral Health Foundation website.
Eating with dentures
When you first start wearing dentures, you should eat soft foods cut into small pieces and chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth.
Avoid chewing gum and any food that's sticky, hard or has sharp edges.
You can gradually start to eat other types of food until you're back to your old diet. Never use toothpicks.
Denture adhesive
If your dentures fit properly, you shouldn't necessarily need to use denture fixative (adhesive).
But if your jawbone has shrunk significantly, adhesive may be the only way to help retain your dentures. 
Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you if this is the case.
At first, some people feel more confident with their dentures if they use adhesive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid using excessive amounts.
Adhesive can be removed from the denture by brushing with soap and water. 
Remnants of adhesive left in the mouth may need to be removed with some damp kitchen roll or a clean damp flannel."
When to see your dentist,"You should continue to see your dentist regularly if you have dentures (even if you have complete dentures) so they can check for any problems.
Your dentures should last several years if you take good care of them.
But your gums and jawbone will eventually shrink, which means the dentures may not fit as well as they used to and can become loose, or they may become worn.
See your dentist as soon as possible if:
your dentures click when you're talking
your dentures tend to slip, or you feel they no longer fit properly
your dentures feel uncomfortable
your dentures are visibly worn
you have signs of gum disease or tooth decay, such as bleeding gums or bad breath
If poorly fitting or worn dentures aren't replaced, they can cause great discomfort and lead to mouth sores, infections or problems eating and speaking."
How much dentures cost on the NHS,"Having dentures fitted is a band 3 treatment.
Read about understanding NHS dental charges for the different bands and how to get help with dental costs."
Check if you have a detached retina,"Symptoms of a detached retina include:
floaters (dots and lines) or flashes of light in your eye
a dark ""curtain"" or shadow in your vision
changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision"
Treatment for a detached retina,"You'll be referred to hospital for surgery if tests show your retina may be detached or has started to come away (retinal tear).
Surgery will usually stop your vision getting worse.
What happens during surgery for a detached retina or tear"
Recovering from a detached retina,"Recovery time after surgery for a detached retina varies. But as a general guide, for 2 to 6 weeks after surgery:
your vision may be blurry
your eye may be sore and red – take paracetamol if you need to
you may need to take time off work
you may not be able to drive
you may need to avoid flying (if you've had a bubble of gas put into your eye)
Most people are eventually able to return to all their normal activities.
Important
Call the hospital or go to A&E if the pain, redness or blurriness gets worse after surgery. You may need further treatment."
Causes of a detached retina,"A detached retina is usually caused by changes to the jelly inside your eye, which can happen as you get older. This is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
It's not clear exactly why PVD can lead to retinal detachment in some people and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. But it's more likely to happen if you:
are short-sighted
have had an eye operation (such as cataract surgery)
have had an eye injury
have a family history of retinal detachment"
Symptoms of DCD,"Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD. Drawing, writing and performance in sports are also usually behind what is expected for their age.
Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development. This means a definite diagnosis of DCD does not usually happen until a child with the condition is 5 years old or more.
Find out more about symptoms of DCD in children."
When to seek medical advice,"If you're concerned about your child's health or development, talk to a GP or health visitor, or speak to a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school.
They may refer your child to an occupational therapist, paediatrician, or another health professional who can assess them and try to identify any developmental problems.
Find out more about diagnosing DCD in children."
Causes of DCD,"Doing co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain.
Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination.
It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD.
However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified.
These include:
being born prematurely, before the 37th week of pregnancy
being born with a low birth weight
having a family history of DCD, although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition
the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant"
Treating DCD,"There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can help children to manage their problems.
These include:
being taught ways to do activities they find difficult, such as breaking down difficult movements into smaller parts and practicing them regularly
adapting tasks to make them easier, such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold
Although DCD does not affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school.
Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together.
Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this may be less of a problem as they get older and develop coping strategies. Some children may continue to have problems.
However, difficulties in school – particularly producing written work – can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers.
Find out more about treating DCD in children."
Dyspraxia or DCD?,"While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, this term is used less often by healthcare professionals.
Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition.
This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because dyspraxia can have several meanings.
For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that happen later in life because of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury.
Some healthcare professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD."
Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (pre-diabetes),"Many people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, or pre-diabetes.
People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk can be reduced through lifestyle changes.
If you have non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, you may be eligible for the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme. The programme helps people make lasting lifestyle changes and has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes.
People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are also recommended to have a blood test every year to monitor their blood sugar levels.
It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it's likely to get worse if left untreated and can cause long-term health problems."
When to see a GP,"Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include:
feeling very thirsty
peeing more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush
blurred vision
Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days.
Weight loss is common in people with type 1 diabetes when it first develops and before it's treated, but it's less common in people with type 2 diabetes.
Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general, or there are no symptoms at all."
Causes of diabetes,"The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).
When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.
However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.
There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes.
You can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.
You may be more at risk of type 2 diabetes if you:
are living with overweight or obesity
do not have a healthy diet
have a family history of type 2 diabetes
are of Asian, Black African or African Caribbean origin
take certain medicines such as steroids for a long time
have high blood pressure
have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy"
Living with diabetes,"If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and have regular checks including blood tests.
You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight.
Try to quit smoking if you smoke, and cut down on alcohol.
People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life.
Type 2 diabetes can get worse over time and people living with type 2 diabetes often need medicine, usually in the form of tablets or injections.
However, some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight, where their blood sugar is reduced below the diabetes range. Some people are able to do this through a low-calorie diet, but this is not suitable for everyone, so it's important to get medical advice first.

Diabetic eye screening,"Everyone with diabetes aged 12 years old or over should be invited to have their eyes screened regularly.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated.
Screening, which includes a 30-minute check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy and detecting the condition early where possible so it can be treated more effectively. In many people, this can stop it affecting their vision or reduce the chance of it getting worse.
It's important to see a doctor if you notice any problems with your eyesight. Do not wait for your next screening appointment.
Read more about diabetic eye screening."
Diabetic foot problems,"Diabetes can damage the nerves in your feet and cause a loss of feeling. It can also reduce the blood supply to your feet. This means you may not notice if your foot is sore or injured, and foot injuries do not heal as well. This can lead to ulcers and infections, and sometimes amputations can be needed in serious cases.
Adults with diabetes should have their feet checked every year by a healthcare professional.
It's important to see a healthcare professional as soon as possible if you notice any problems with your feet.
You can read more about diabetes and foot problems on the Diabetes UK website."
Who's at risk of gestational diabetes,"Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if:
you are over 40
your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI
you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lb) or more at birth
you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy
1 of your parents or siblings has diabetes
you are of south Asian, Black, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern origin (even if you were born in the UK)
you have had a gastric bypass or other weight-loss surgery
If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy."
Symptoms of gestational diabetes,"Gestational diabetes does not usually cause any symptoms.
Most cases are only discovered when your blood sugar levels are tested during screening for gestational diabetes.
Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar levels gets too high (hyperglycaemia), such as:
increased thirst
needing to pee more often than usual
a dry mouth
tiredness
blurred eyesight
genital itching or thrush
But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy and are not necessarily a sign of gestational diabetes. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing."
How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy,"Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies.
However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as:
your baby growing larger than usual – this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section
polyhydramnios – too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery
premature birth – giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy
pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated
your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital
the loss of your baby (stillbirth) – though this is rare
Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future."
Screening for gestational diabetes,"During your first antenatal appointment (also called a booking appointment) at around week 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes.
If you have 1 or more risk factors for gestational diabetes you should be offered a screening test.
The screening test is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about 2 hours.
It involves having a blood test in the morning, when you have not had any food or drink for 8 to 10 hours (though you can usually drink water, but check with the hospital if you're unsure). You're then given a glucose drink. 
After resting for 2 hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose.
The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in your pregnancy, soon after your booking appointment, then another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal.
Find out more at Lab Tests Online: Glucose Tests."
Treatments for gestational diabetes,"If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels.
You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment.
Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before.
However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections.
You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems.
If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time.
Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled.
Find out more about how gestational diabetes is treated."
Long-term effects of gestational diabetes,"Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop:
gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies
type 2 diabetes – a lifelong type of diabetes
You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal.
See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test. 
You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms.
You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.
Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life."
Planning future pregnancies,"If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this.
If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant.
Read more about diabetes in pregnancy.
If you have an unplanned pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy.
If tests show you do not have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy (soon after your first midwife appointment) and another test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal.
Alternatively, your midwife or doctor may suggest you test your blood sugar levels yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes."
When to seek medical advice,"You should always see your GP if you're feeling thirsty all the time.
Although it may not be diabetes insipidus, it should be investigated.
Also see your GP if you're:
peeing more than normal – most healthy adults pass urine 4 to 7 times in a 24-hour period
needing to pee small amounts at frequent intervals – sometimes this can occur along with the feeling that you need to pee immediately
Children tend to pee more frequently because they have smaller bladders.
But seek medical advice if your child pees more than 10 times a day.
Your GP will be able to carry out a number of tests to help determine what's causing the problem.
Find out more about diagnosing diabetes insipidus"
What causes diabetes insipidus,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called vasopressin (AVP), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
AVP plays a key role in regulating the amount of fluid in the body.
It's produced by specialist nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus.
AVP passes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, where it's stored until needed.
The pituitary gland releases AVP when the amount of water in the body becomes too low. 
It helps retain water in the body by reducing the amount of water lost through the kidneys, making the kidneys produce more concentrated urine.
In diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of AVP means the kidneys cannot make enough concentrated urine and too much water is passed from the body.
In rare cases, the kidneys do not respond to AVP. This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
People feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in.
Find out more about the causes of diabetes insipidus"
Who's affected by diabetes insipidus,"Diabetes insipidus affects about 1 in 25,000 people in the general population.
Adults are more likely to develop the condition, but it can occur at any age.
In rarer cases, diabetes insipidus can develop during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes insipidus."
Types of diabetes insipidus,"There are 2 main types of diabetes insipidus:
cranial diabetes insipidus
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
Cranial diabetes insipidus
Cranial diabetes insipidus occurs when there's not enough AVP in the body to regulate urine production.
Cranial diabetes insipidus is the most common type of diabetes insipidus.
It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland – for example, after an infection, operation, brain tumour or head injury.
In about 1 in 3 cases of cranial diabetes insipidus there's no obvious reason why the hypothalamus stops making enough AVP.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there's enough AVP in the body but the kidneys fail to respond to it.
It can be caused by kidney damage or, in some cases, inherited as a problem on its own.
Some medications, particularly lithium (used to help stabilise mood in some people with specific mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder), can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
Treating diabetes insipidus,"Treatment is not always needed for mild cases of cranial diabetes insipidus.
You just need to increase the amount of water you drink to compensate for the fluid lost through urination.
If necessary, a medication called desmopressin can be used to replicate the functions of AVP.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics, which reduce the amount of urine the kidneys produce.
Find out more about treating diabetes insipidus"
Complications,"As diabetes insipidus increases water loss in the urine, the amount of water in the body can become low. This is known as dehydration.
Rehydration with water can be used to treat mild dehydration. Severe dehydration will need to be treated in hospital.
Find out more about the complications of diabetes insipidus"
Check if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA),"Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) include:
feeling thirsty
needing to pee more often
stomach pain, feeling sick or being sick
diarrhoea
breathing more deeply than usual
breath that smells fruity (like pear drop sweets or nail polish remover)
feeling tired, sleepy or confused
blurred vision
The symptoms usually develop over 24 hours, but it can be faster.
DKA usually affects people with type 1 diabetes, but it can also happen in people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin.
It can happen when people first develop type 1 diabetes and have not yet been diagnosed, particularly children.
Checking your blood glucose and ketones
If you have diabetes and have any of the symptoms of DKA, check your blood glucose. If it's high, test for ketones if you can.
If you use a meter to test for ketones in your blood:
under 0.6mmol/L is normal
0.6 to 1.5mmol/L is slightly high – test again in 2 hours
1.6 to 3mmol/L means you're at risk of DKA and should speak to your diabetes care team for advice
over 3mmol/L is high and means you may have DKA and should call 999 or go to A&E
If you use strips to test for ketones in your pee, over 2+ is high. This means you may have DKA and should call 999 or go to A&E.
Important
These ketone levels are a guide. Normal blood ketone levels can be different for different people. Your diabetes care team will advise you on what levels to look for."
Treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA),"If you have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) you'll need to be admitted to hospital for urgent treatment.
You'll be given insulin, fluids and nutrients through a drip into your vein.
You'll be monitored for complications, as DKA can sometimes affect your brain, heart or lungs.
Once your ketones are at a safe level and you can eat and drink normally you'll be able to go home.
The doctors will talk to you about what caused DKA and give you advice on how to reduce the risk of it happening again."
How to reduce your risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA),"If you have diabetes, it's important to be aware of the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and how to reduce the risk of getting it.
Causes of DKA can include being unwell, having an injury or surgery, having your period, or not taking enough insulin.
Testing for ketones will help you know when you need to take action, such as increasing your insulin dose.
You can get kit to test for ketones free from the NHS, or buy it from a pharmacy. You can use:
a ketone meter to test your blood
some types of blood glucose monitor that also test for ketones
strips to test your pee
Do
follow the treatment plan agreed with your diabetes care team, including adjusting your insulin dose when you need to
check your blood glucose regularly
ask your care team about getting a continuous glucose monitor or flash monitor if you do not already have one
test for ketones when your blood glucose is high and when you're ill
follow the sick day rules you've been given by your care team when you're ill
contact your care team if you're not sure what to do
Don’t
do not stop taking insulin, even if you're not eating
do not skip insulin doses"
How diabetes can affect the eyes,"The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain which turns them into the images you see.
The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels.
Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in 3 main stages:
background retinopathy – tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but do not usually affect your vision
pre-proliferative retinopathy – more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye
proliferative retinopathy – scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina; this can result in some loss of vision
However, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and treatment can stop it getting worse.
Read about the stages of diabetic retinopathy."
Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy?,"Anyone with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
You're at a greater risk if you:
have had diabetes for a long time
have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose) level
have high blood pressure
have high cholesterol
are pregnant
are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background
By keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can reduce your chances of developing diabetic retinopathy."
Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy,"You will not usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as it does not tend to have any obvious symptoms until it's more advanced.
However, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during diabetic eye screening.
Contact your GP or diabetes care team immediately if you experience:
gradually worsening vision
sudden vision loss
shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters)
blurred or patchy vision
eye pain or redness
difficulty seeing in the dark
These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it's important to get them checked out. 
Do not wait until your next screening appointment."
Diabetic eye screening,"Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over is invited for eye screening. How often you're invited depends on your last 2 screening results. If diabetic retinopathy was not found at your last 2 tests, you'll be invited every 2 years.
Screening is offered because:
diabetic retinopathy does not tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages
the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly
screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your vision
if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss
The screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs.
Depending on your result, you may be advised to attend more regular appointments or discuss treatment options with a specialist.
Read more about diabetic eye screening."
Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy,"You can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by:
controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels
taking your diabetes medicine as prescribed
attending all your screening appointments
getting medical advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision
maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking
Read more about how to prevent diabetic retinopathy."
Treatments for diabetic retinopathy,"Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.
If the condition has not reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended.
The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:
laser treatment
injections of medication into your eyes
an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes
Read more about the treatment of diabetic retinopathy."
Why do I need dialysis?,"If your kidneys are not working properly – for example, because you have advanced chronic kidney disease (kidney failure) – the kidneys may not be able to clean the blood properly.
Waste products and fluid can build up to dangerous levels in your body. Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal.
Dialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens."
How long will I need dialysis for?,"It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover.
But often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant.
It's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available.
If a kidney transplant is not suitable for you – for example, because you're not well enough to have a major operation – dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life."
What happens during dialysis,"There are 2 main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
Haemodialysis
Haemodialysis is the most common type of dialysis and the one most people are aware of.
During the procedure, a tube is attached to a needle in your arm. 
Blood passes along the tube and into an external machine that filters it, before it's passed back into the arm along another tube.
At dialysis centres, this is usually carried out 3 days a week, with each session lasting around 4 hours.
It can also be done at home. Some examples of a home dialysis schedule include:
4 times a week for 4 hours
5 times a week for 3 hours
6 days a week for 8 hours overnight
Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis uses the inside lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter, rather than a machine.
Like the kidneys, the peritoneum contains thousands of tiny blood vessels, making it a useful filtering device.
Before treatment starts, a cut (incision) is made near your belly button and a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the incision and into the space inside your abdomen (the peritoneal cavity). This is left in place permanently.
Fluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. As blood passes through the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid.
The used fluid is drained into a bag a few hours later and replaced with fresh fluid.
Changing the fluid usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes and normally needs to be repeated around 4 times a day.
If you prefer, this can be done by a machine overnight while you sleep.

Which type of dialysis is best?,"In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have and where to have it.
The 2 techniques are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks.
For example:
haemodialysis means you'll have 4 treatment-free days a week, but the treatment sessions last longer and you may need to visit hospital each time
home haemodialysis – you'll usually need to have dialysis sessions more often than you would in a clinic, but you can choose a treatment plan that meets your medical needs and fits around your life
peritoneal dialysis can be done quite easily at home and can sometimes be done while you sleep, but it needs to be done every day
If you're able to choose the type of dialysis you prefer, your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision.
Read more about the advantages and disadvantages of both types of dialysis"
Side effects of dialysis,"Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps. Peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis, an infection of the thin membrane that surrounds your abdomen.
Both types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted.
Read more about the possible side effects of dialysis."
Life on dialysis,"Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life.
If you're otherwise well, you should be able to:
continue working or studying
drive
exercise
go swimming
go on holiday
Most people can remain on dialysis for many years, although the treatment can only partially compensate for the loss of kidney function.
Having kidneys that do not work properly can place a significant strain on the body.
This means that people can die while on dialysis if they do not have a kidney transplant, particularly older people and those with other health problems.
Someone who starts dialysis in their late 20s can expect to live for up to 20 years or longer, but adults over 75 may only survive for 2 to 3 years.
But survival rates of people on dialysis have improved over the past decade and are expected to continue improving in the future."
Why does DSD happen?,"velopment (DSD) is a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, including genitals. It means a person's sex development is different to most other people's.
Sometimes the term Disorders of Sex Development is used, as is Variations in Sex Characteristics (VSC) or Diverse Sex Development. Some people prefer to use the term intersex.
Why does DSD happen?
You or your child may have sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) usually associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or usually associated with being male (XY chromosomes), but reproductive organs and genitals that may look different from usual.
This happens because of a difference with your genes or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body, or both. It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens.
The most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager."
Types of DSDs,"There are many different types of DSD. Some examples are:
Usual female pattern genes with genitals that look different to girls' genitals
Some people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females.
For example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed.
Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD.
The most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.
Without these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place.
CAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible

Living with CAH - what is CAH?
Genes usually seen in males with genitals that look the same as most girls' and some internal male structures
Some people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys.
Sometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly.
Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD.
Many people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it.
For some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes.
There are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body ""ignores"" androgens or is insensitive to them.
Sometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens.
Complete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female.
Ordinary looking genitals but different sex development
Some people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY).
Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods.
Doctors call this sex chromosome DSD.
One type is Klinefelter syndrome, which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY).
This can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men.
Another example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome, which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome.
Girls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average.

Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association
Turner Syndrome Support Society - What is TS?
Female with usual external genitals, but without a womb
Some females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older.
This is called Rokitansky syndrome. It's also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes.
Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women's.
Not having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman's womb (surrogacy).
You can find more support and information on Rokitansky syndrome at:
DSD Teens – MRKH (a.k.a. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome)
MRKH Connect – What is MRKH
Sex characteristics usually seen in males or females
Some people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis). Their genitals may appear female or male or could look different from either.
Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes. The cause is not usually clear, but some people with the condition have been found to have genetic material that's usually seen on the Y chromosome appearing on their X chromosome.
Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD."
What happens after the birth of a baby,"Doctors will check a baby for DSD soon after birth because of signs such as undescended testicles or if a baby's genitals look different.
Tests may be done to help get a clear diagnosis and find out whether any immediate treatment is needed.
Tests may include:
a further physical examination of your baby done by a specialist
an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs
blood tests to check their genes and hormone levels
In England you need to register your baby’s birth within 42 days. This is usually enough time to complete the tests, discuss the results with your child’s care team and identify your baby’s sex.
Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby's development and knowing what to expect as they grow older.
A specialist nurse in your care team can help you learn about DSD and a psychologist will help you address any concerns you have.
Find out more about what happens when your baby is born with genitals that look different, in the First Days leaflet. This is on the DSD Families Resources website page."
Advice for parents of older children,"Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not go through puberty properly. For example, your child may not start showing the changes linked with puberty, or they may start puberty but not have periods.
Speak to a GP if you have any concerns about your child's development at puberty. They can refer your child to a specialist. This will usually be a consultant paediatric endocrinologist, who specialises in hormones, or an adolescent gynaecologist.
A team of specialist healthcare professionals will work with you to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice.
A psychologist in the team can talk with you or your child about sexuality, relationships and body image among other subjects.
Some people with DSD may need hormone therapy and psychological support. Some may want to think about altering their existing genitals, for example by using vaginal stretch techniques.
Some people with DSD consider altering the appearance of their genitals by having surgery."
If you think you have a DSD,"If you think or know you have a DSD, information and support is available.
Speak to a GP, as they'll be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals. They can answer your questions, help you stay healthy and put you in touch with others with DSD if that's something you're interested in.
You can stay with the gender linked to your sex at birth, which is the sex on your birth certificate. But if your legal sex does not represent who you are or how you identify, you may want to discuss your options with your care team.
If you have a DSD and want to explore parenthood, you can also discuss this with your specialist care team."
Where to get support,"If you have a DSD or you're the parent of a child with a DSD, you may find it useful to contact a group involving others with the same or similar experiences.
These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and may be able to put you in contact with others who've been in a similar situation to you.
You are welcome to ask your care team about people with experience of your diagnosis in your local area who are happy to be contacted."
Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome,"DiGeorge syndrome can cause a range of problems, but most people will not have all of these.
Some of the most common issues are:
learning and behaviour problems – including delays in learning to walk or talk, learning disabilities and problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism
speech and hearing problems – including temporary hearing loss due to frequent ear infections, being slow to start talking and having a ""nasal-sounding"" voice
mouth and feeding problems – including a gap in the top of the mouth or lip (cleft lip or palate), difficulty feeding and sometimes bringing food back up through the nose
heart problems – some children and adults have heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease)
hormone problems – underdeveloped parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism), which can lead to problems such as shaking (tremors) and seizures (fits)
Other possible problems include:
a higher risk of getting infections – such as ear infections, oral thrush and chest infections – because the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness) is weaker than normal
bone, muscle and joint problems – including leg pains that keep coming back, an unusually curved spine (scoliosis) and rheumatoid arthritis
short stature – children and adults may be shorter than average
mental health problems – adults are more likely to have problems such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders"
Causes of DiGeorge syndrome,"DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem called 22q11 deletion. This is where a small piece of genetic material is missing from a person's DNA.
In about 9 in 10 cases (90%), the bit of DNA was missing from the egg or sperm that led to the pregnancy. This can happen by chance when sperm and eggs are made. It is not a result of anything you did before or during the pregnancy.
In these cases, there's usually no family history of DiGeorge syndrome and the risk of it happening again to other children is very small.
In around 1 in 10 cases (10%), the 22q11 deletion is passed on to a child by a parent who has DiGeorge syndrome, although they may not realise they have it if it's mild."
What are the chances of my next child having DiGeorge syndrome?,"If neither parent has DiGeorge syndrome, the risk of having another child with it is thought to be less than 1 in 100 (1%).
If 1 parent has the condition, they have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of passing it on to their child. This applies to each pregnancy.
Speak to a GP if you're planning a pregnancy and you have a family history of DiGeorge syndrome, or you have a child with it.
They may refer you for a genetic test and talk about your level of risk and discuss your options. These may include:
having a blood test to check if you or your partner carry the genetic problem that causes DiGeorge syndrome
having tests during pregnancy (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) to check if your baby has the genetic problem that causes the condition – although this cannot show how severely your child will be affected
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – a type of IVF where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and embryos are tested for genetic problems before they're implanted in the womb (this is not always available on the NHS)"
Treatment and support for DiGeorge syndrome,"There's currently no cure for DiGeorge syndrome. Children and adults with the condition will be closely monitored to check for problems, and these can be treated as they happen, if needed.
For example, someone with DiGeorge syndrome may have:
regular hearing tests, blood tests, heart scans and measurements of their height and weight
an assessment of their development and learning ability before starting school – if your child has a learning disability, they may need extra support at a mainstream school, or they may benefit from attending a special school (read more about education for children with learning disabilities)
speech therapy to help with speech problems and dietary changes (or sometimes a temporary feeding tube) to help with feeding problems
physiotherapy for problems with strength and movement
treatment from a podiatrist for foot and leg problems, and devices such as shoe inserts (orthoses) for leg pain
surgery for more severe problems – for example, surgery to repair heart defects or an operation to repair a cleft palate
You may find it useful to speak to a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or through a doctor.
Charities such as Max Appeal! may also be a good source of support.
Read more advice about caring for a disabled child."
Outlook for DiGeorge syndrome,"Everyone with DiGeorge syndrome is affected differently and it's difficult to predict how severe the condition will be. Most children survive into adulthood.
As someone with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, some symptoms, such as heart and speech problems, tend to become less of an issue. However, behavioural, learning, and mental health problems can continue to affect their daily life.
Many people with DiGeorge syndrome who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, but ongoing health problems can sometimes mean their life expectancy is a bit lower than usual. It's important to attend regular check-ups so that any problems can be found and treated early.
Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently."
Information about you or your child,"If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register"
Diphtheria vaccination,"Diphtheria is rare in the UK because babies and children have been routinely vaccinated against it since the 1940s.
When childhood diphtheria vaccinations are given
Travel vaccination
The best way to avoid diphtheria while travelling is to be fully vaccinated against it.
If you're travelling to a part of the world where there may be a risk of diphtheria, you may need a booster vaccination if you were last vaccinated against it more than 10 years ago.
Since 2018, the World Health Organization has reported a rise in cases in places including:
Indonesia
India
South America
Africa
Places that have higher cases of diphtheria often change over time. For up-to-date information about the area you're visiting, check the TravelHealthPro country guides.
Information:
You may be able to get a combined vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and polio free on the NHS. Ask at a GP surgery."
How diphtheria is spread,"Diphtheria is a highly contagious bacterial infection. It's spread by coughs and sneezes, or through close contact with someone who is infected.
You can also get it by sharing items, such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding, with an infected person."
Symptoms of diphtheria,"Symptoms usually start 2 to 5 days after becoming infected.
Symptoms of diphtheria include:
a thick grey-white coating that may cover the back of your throat, nose and tongue
a high temperature (fever)
sore throat
swollen glands in your neck
difficulty breathing and swallowing
In countries with poor hygiene, infection of the skin (cutaneous diphtheria) is more common.
If it's cutaneous diphtheria, it can cause:
pus-filled blisters on your legs, feet and hands
large ulcers surrounded by red, sore-looking skin"
Treatments for diphtheria,"The main treatments are:
antibiotics to kill the diphtheria bacteria
medicines that stop the effects of the harmful substances (toxins) produced by the bacteria
thoroughly cleaning any infected wounds if you have diphtheria affecting your skin
Treatment usually lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Any skin ulcers usually heal within 2 to 3 months, but may leave a scar.
People who have been in close contact with someone who has diphtheria may also need to take antibiotics, or may be given a dose of the diphtheria vaccination."
Symptoms of discoid eczema,"Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema. It can affect any part of the body, although it does not usually affect the face or scalp.
Credit:
The first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.
On lighter skin these patches will be pink or red. On darker skin these patches can be a dark brown or they can be paler than the skin around them.
Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.
Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm.
You may just have 1 patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry.
Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include:
the patches oozing a lot of fluid
a yellow crust developing over the patches
the skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painful
feeling sick
feeling hot or shivery
feeling unwell"
When to seek medical advice,"See a pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema. They can recommend a suitable treatment.
You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected. You may need to use an antibiotic cream or, in severe cases, take antibiotics as a tablet or capsule.
A GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions.
A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test."
Causes of discoid eczema,"The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin.
When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin.
It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema.
Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema, which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.
Other possible triggers 
An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn.
Some medicines have been linked to discoid eczema. You should not stop taking any prescribed medicine without talking to the doctor who prescribed it for you.
Dry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse, and sunny or damp (humid) environments may make your symptoms better."
Treating discoid eczema,"Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medicines are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control.
Treatments include:
emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry
topical corticosteroids – ointments and creams containing a steroid that are applied to the skin and may relieve severe symptoms
antihistamines – medicines that can reduce itching
There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels.
Additional medicine can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe.
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up.
Find out more about treating discoid eczema."
Other types of eczema ,"Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include:
atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema, it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions such as asthma and hay fever
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that happens when the skin comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that usually affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins"
While you are waiting for medical help,"If you think you have dislocated your kneecap, there are some things you can do while waiting for treatment:
Do
keep the knee still
keep the knee supported with padding while sitting or lying down – you can use rolled up clothing, towels or cushions
Don’t
do not raise the affected knee
do not try to stand or walk on the affected leg
do not try to put the kneecap back into place yourself"
Treatment for a dislocated kneecap,"A dislocated kneecap often moves back into place by itself.
Even if it does, you will still need to get it checked by a doctor. You will usually need X-rays or an MRI scan.
If your kneecap does not go back into place by itself, a doctor may have to move it back. You will be given a local anaesthetic and may be offered a sedative so you do not feel any pain.
Surgery may be needed if you have badly damaged your knee. Some people may also need surgery to stop the knee from dislocating again.
After treatment, you'll need to go to follow-up appointments to check your knee is healing properly."
Recovering from a dislocated kneecap,"It can take 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover from a dislocated kneecap, but you will usually be able to walk using the affected knee within a few days.
You may be given a knee support to wear for 2 weeks to help it heal. If walking is painful, using a crutch may help.
Your doctor or a physiotherapist will show you knee exercises that you should do regularly to help speed up your recovery.
Things you can do to help your recovery
There are some things you can do to help with the recovery of a dislocated kneecap.
Do
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain
keep your knee and lower leg slightly raised and supported when resting to reduce swelling
do knee exercises throughout the day to stop your knee getting stiff
stay as active as you can
Don’t
do not twist your knee
do not play sport until your knee has fully recovered its usual strength – your doctor or physiotherapist should be able to give you advice about this"
What to do while you’re waiting for treatment,"If you think you’ve dislocated your shoulder, there are some things you can do while you’re waiting for treatment.
Do
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to your shoulder for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
put your arm in a sling or use a towel to support the affected arm
take paracetamol for the pain – always follow the dosage advice on the packet
Don’t
do not move your upper arm
do not try to put your arm back in yourself"
Treatment for a dislocated shoulder,"You will usually have an X-ray to check your shoulder is dislocated.
If it is dislocated, a doctor will rotate your arm back into place.
You will be given a local anaesthetic or a sedative so you do not feel any pain.
Once your arm is back in place, you’ll be given a sling to support your arm
Sometimes you may also need surgery to reduce your risk of dislocating the same shoulder again."
Recovering from a dislocated shoulder,"It usually takes up to 12 weeks to recover from a dislocated shoulder. It may take up to 16 weeks to fully return to playing some sports, but for some recovery can take longer.
You’ll need to wear a sling to support your arm for the first few weeks.
A physiotherapist may recommend some regular shoulder exercises to help reduce pain and stiffness.
Your doctor or physiotherapist will advise you on when you can return to daily tasks like driving or playing sport."
Reducing the risk of dislocating your shoulder again,"Once you dislocate your shoulder, there’s an increased risk it could happen again.
The risk depends on your age and how well your shoulder joint healed.
You may be offered a scan to check if your shoulder has been damaged.
It’s important to follow any advice you’re given by the hospital or doctor.
The hospital may recommend regular physiotherapy appointments to help make your shoulder muscles stronger and reduce the risk of dislocating your shoulder again."
Coma,"A coma is when a person shows no signs of being awake and no signs of being aware.
A person in a coma lies with their eyes closed and doesn't respond to their environment, voices or pain.
A coma usually lasts for less than 2 to 4 weeks, during which time a person may wake up or progress into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.
Read more about comas."
Vegetative state,"A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness.
A person in a vegetative state may:
open their eyes
wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals
have basic reflexes (such as blinking when they're startled by a loud noise or withdrawing their hand when it's squeezed hard)
They're also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance.
But a person in a vegetative state doesn't show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices.
They also show no signs of experiencing emotions.
If a person is in a vegetative state for a long time, it may be considered to be:
a continuing vegetative state when it's been longer than 4 weeks
a permanent vegetative state when it's been more than 6 months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury
If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible."
Minimally conscious state,"A person who shows clear but minimal or inconsistent awareness is classified as being in a minimally conscious state.
They may have periods where they can communicate or respond to commands, such as moving a finger when asked.
A person may enter a minimally conscious state after being in a coma or vegetative state.
In some cases a minimally conscious state is a stage on the route to recovery, but in others it's permanent.
As with vegetative state, a continuing minimally conscious state means it's lasted longer than 4 weeks.
But it's more difficult to diagnose a permanent minimally conscious state because it depends on things like:
the type of brain injury
how severe the injury is
how responsive the person is
In most cases, a minimally conscious state isn't usually considered to be permanent until it's lasted for several months and there have been no signs of improvement.
A person thought to be in a permanent minimally conscious state usually has the same prognosis as a person in a vegetative state. The longer they remain in that state, the less chance they have for recovery."
Why they happen,"Disorders of consciousness can occur if the parts of the brain involved with consciousness are damaged.
These types of brain injury can be divided into:
traumatic brain injury – the result of a severe head injury, such as an injury sustained during a car accident or a fall from a great height
non-traumatic brain injury – where the injury to the brain is caused by a health condition, such as a stroke
progressive brain damage – where the brain is gradually damaged over time (for example, because of Alzheimer's disease)
Read more about the causes of disorders of consciousness."
Making a diagnosis,"A disorder of consciousness will only be confirmed after extensive testing to determine the person's level of wakefulness and awareness.
These examinations need to be carried out by someone experienced in disorders of consciousness, although the views of other healthcare professionals and family members should also be taken into consideration.
For some states of impaired consciousness, such as vegetative state and minimally conscious state, there are recommended criteria to help confirm a diagnosis.
Read more about diagnosing disorders of consciousness."
Treatment and care,"Treatment can't ensure recovery from a state of impaired consciousness.
Instead, supportive treatment is used to give the best chance of natural improvement.
This can involve:
providing nutrition through a feeding tube
making sure the person is moved regularly so they don't develop pressure ulcers
gently exercising their joints to prevent them becoming tight
keeping their skin clean
managing their bowel and bladder (for example, using a tube known as a catheter to drain the bladder)
keeping their teeth and mouth clean
offering opportunities for periods of meaningful activity – such as listening to music or watching television, being shown pictures or hearing family members talking
Sensory stimulation
In some cases, a treatment called sensory stimulation may be used in an attempt to increase responsiveness.
This involves stimulating the main senses, such as vision, hearing and smell.
It's usually carried out by a trained specialist, but family members are often encouraged to be involved.
Some examples of sensory stimulation include:
visual – showing photos of friends and family, or a favourite film
hearing – talking or playing a favourite song
smell – putting flowers in the room or spraying a favourite perfume
touch – holding their hand or stroking their skin with different fabrics
It's not entirely clear how effective sensory stimulation is, but it's sometimes considered worthwhile."
Recovery,"It's impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving.
It largely depends on:
the type of brain injury
how severe the injury is
the person's age
how long they have been in the state for
Some people improve gradually, whereas others stay in a state of impaired consciousness for years. Many people never recover consciousness.
There are only isolated cases of people recovering consciousness after several years.
The few people who do regain consciousness after this time often have severe disabilities caused by the damage to their brain."
Withdrawing nutritional support,"If a person is in a permanent vegetative state for 12 months after a traumatic brain injury, or 6 months after a non-traumatic brain injury, then it may be recommended to withdraw their nutritional support.
This is because:
there's almost no chance of a recovery by this point
prolonging life would have no benefit for the person concerned
prolonging treatment could offer false hope and cause unnecessary emotional distress for the friends and family of the person concerned
The medical team will discuss the issue with family members.
If the family disagrees with the decision, then it will be referred to the courts.
If a decision is made to end nutritional support, a palliative care team, which specialises in providing care to the dying, will usually be involved in planning the withdrawal.
Once nutritional support is eventually withdrawn, the person will die within a few weeks"
Locked-in syndrome,"Locked-in syndrome has similar features to disorders of consciousness, but is considered and treated differently. 
A person with locked-in syndrome is both conscious and aware, but completely paralysed and unable to speak.
They're usually able to move their eyes and are sometimes able to communicate by blinking."
Symptoms of a dissociative disorder,"Symptoms of dissociative disorder can vary but may include:
feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you
forgetting about certain time periods, events and personal information
feeling uncertain about who you are
having multiple distinct identities
feeling little or no physical pain
Some people with dissociative disorders have seizures. These can vary from fainting to something more like an epileptic seizure.
Dissociation is a way the mind copes with too much stress.
Periods of dissociation can last for a relatively short time (hours or days) or for much longer (weeks or months).
Many people with a dissociative disorder have had a traumatic event during childhood. Dissociation can happen as a way of coping with it."
Types of dissociative disorder,"There are several different types of dissociative disorder.
The 3 main types are:
depersonalisation-derealisation disorder
dissociative amnesia
dissociative identity disorder
Depersonalisation-derealisation disorder
Depersonalisation is where you have the feeling of being outside yourself and observing your actions, feelings or thoughts from a distance.
Derealisation is where you feel the world is unreal. People and things around you may seem ""lifeless"" or ""foggy"".
You can have depersonalisation or derealisation, or both together. It may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.
Dissociative amnesia
Someone with dissociative amnesia will have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or events in their past life.
They may also forget a learned talent or skill.
These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness and are not the result of another medical condition.
Some people with dissociative amnesia find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there.
They may have travelled there on purpose, or wandered in a confused state.
These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days. In rare cases, they can last months or years.
Dissociative identity disorder
Dissociative identity disorder (DID) used to be called multiple personality disorder.
Someone diagnosed with DID may feel uncertain about their identity and who they are.
They may feel the presence of other identities, each with their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms.
The main symptoms of DID are:
memory gaps about everyday events and personal information
having several distinct identities"
Associated conditions,"Someone with a dissociative disorder may also have other mental health conditions, such as:
medically unexplained symptoms
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
depression
mood swings
anxiety and panic attacks
suicidal tendencies or self-harm
an eating disorder
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
They may also have problems sleeping (insomnia)."
Causes of dissociative disorder,"There are many possible causes of dissociative disorders, including previous traumatic experience.
Someone with a dissociative disorder may have experienced physical, sexual or emotional abuse during childhood.
Some people dissociate after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure.
Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person cope during a traumatic time.
It's a form of denial, as if ""this is not happening to me"".
It becomes a problem when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and has not dealt with or processed the event."
Diagnosing dissociative disorders,"A GP may examine you and do some tests to check if another illness might be the cause of your symptoms.
They may also refer you to a mental health specialist for a full assessment.
Assessment
The specialist who carries out your assessment should have a good understanding of dissociative disorders.
The assessment may include questions about your thoughts, feelings, behaviour and your symptoms.
It's important to be honest about your symptoms and not to feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need."
Treatments for dissociative disorders,"Many people with a dissociative disorder make a full recovery with treatment and support.
Talking therapies
Talking therapies are often recommended for dissociative disorders.
The aim of talking therapies such as counselling or psychotherapy is to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and to learn and practise techniques to manage the periods of feeling disconnected.
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological treatment that can help reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is sometimes used to treat dissociative disorders.
Medicines
There's no specific medicine to treat dissociation, but medicines like antidepressants may be prescribed to treat associated conditions like depression, anxiety and panic attacks."
If you're feeling suicidal,"If you have thoughts about taking your life, it's important you ask someone for help.
It's probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you're not alone or beyond help.  
There are people you can talk to who want to help:
speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust, as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space
call the Samaritans free 24-hour support service on 116 123
go to your nearest A&E and tell the staff how you're feeling
contact NHS 111
make an urgent appointment to see a GP
Find out more about getting help if you're feeling suicidal
What to do if you're worried about someone
If you're worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they're feeling.
Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge. 
If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team. They will offer help and advice but cannot share information about the person without consent."
Further help and support,"If you have a dissociative disorder, getting help and support is an important part of the recovery process.
Talking to your partner, family and friends about your experience of dissociative disorder can help them understand how you feel.
Mental health charity Mind has more information on dissociative disorders and a list of support organisations.
Reading about other people with similar experiences may also help.
You can read people's personal accounts of living with a number of different mental health conditions on  healthtalk.org."
Symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis,"The symptoms of diverticular disease include:
pain in the lower left side of your tummy (abdomen) – a small number of people get pain on the right side
tummy pain that gets worse after you eat, and gets better after you poo or fart
constipation
diarrhoea
blood in your poo
bloating
If your intestine becomes infected or inflamed, it's called diverticulitis. You may also have symptoms such as:
severe, constant tummy pain
high temperature
bleeding or passing slime (mucus) from your bottom
Information:
The symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis are similar to those of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)."
Tests for diverticular disease and diverticulitis,"The GP will ask questions to find out what's causing your symptoms. You may need a blood test or to give a poo sample to help find what's wrong.
You may need further tests to confirm if you have diverticular disease or diverticulitis and rule out other conditions. Further tests you may have include:
a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, where a thin tube with a small camera on it is used to check inside your bowels
a CT scan"
Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis,"Treatments that can help with the symptoms of diverticular disease include:
painkillers such as paracetamol
bulk-forming laxatives for constipation and diarrhoea
medicines to help with stomach cramps (antispasmodics)
Diverticulitis is treated with:
antibiotics if the diverticulitis is caused by an infection
painkillers such as paracetamol"
Things you can do to help with diverticular disease and diverticulitis,"If you have diverticular disease or diverticulitis there are things you can do to reduce the risk of your symptoms getting worse in the future.
Do
eat a healthy, balanced diet including whole grains, fruits and vegetables – there are no specific foods you need to avoid
slowly increase how much fibre you eat if you do not each much fibre – and make sure to also drink plenty of water
stop smoking if you smoke
maintain a healthy weight
Don’t
do not take NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) or opioid painkillers (such as codeine) – they can cause stomach problems or constipation, and increase the risk of getting a hole (perforation) in your bowel"
Complications of diverticulitis,"Rarely, diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as:
a build-up of pus (abscess) in your bowel
a blockage in your bowel
an opening from your bowel to another organ, such as your bladder, called a fistula
a hole (perforation) in your bowel, which can cause a severe infection called peritonitis
These problems can sometimes be treated with antibiotics or surgery.
For example, you may need surgery to drain an abscess or remove an infected part of the bowel.
Some people will need to have a colostomy (where your bowel is brought out of a hole in your tummy and a bag is attached to collect your poo)."
Check if you have dizziness,"Dizziness includes feeling:
off-balance
giddy
lightheaded or faint
like you're spinning or things around you are spinning (vertigo)"
How you can treat dizziness yourself,"Dizziness usually goes away on its own. But there are things you can do to take care of yourself while you're feeling dizzy.
Do
lie down until the dizziness passes, then get up slowly
move slowly and carefully
get plenty of rest
drink plenty of fluids, especially water
avoid coffee, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs
Don’t
do not bend down suddenly
do not get up suddenly after sitting or lying down
do not do anything that could be dangerous while you're dizzy, like driving, climbing a ladder or using heavy machinery"
Causes of dizziness,"If you have other symptoms, this might give you an idea of the cause. Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
Dizziness while you're ill with something else
Dizziness for no obvious reason"
How successful is CPR?,"CPR can sometimes get the heart and breathing going again. The actions used in CPR, such as chest compressions, can cause bruising, break ribs and puncture lungs.
Overall, CPR restarts the heart and/or breathing for between 1 and 2 in 10 people whose heart or breathing have stopped.
You have the best chance of CPR restarting your heart or breathing if:
your lungs, heart or other organs are healthy and working well before your heart or breathing stops
you are near a person trained in CPR
any equipment that is needed, such as a defibrillator, is nearby
The chances of CPR starting your heart and/or breathing are lower if your lungs, heart or other organs are struggling to work before CPR is needed. Your organs might be struggling because you:
have previous organ damage (for example, your lungs have been damaged by smoking)
have a serious long-term condition (this is not the same as a disability)
have current severe illness
are frail
are approaching the end of your life
Only a few people make a full recovery even if their heart or breathing can be restarted with CPR.
You may still be very unwell and need more treatment and you may never get back to the health you had before.
Your heart and/or brain may be permanently damaged. This is why DNACPR forms are written. They mean you do not receive a treatment that may prolong or cause suffering at the end of your life."
What does DNACPR mean and how is it recorded?,"DNACPR stands for do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It's sometimes called DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation) or DNR (do not resuscitate) but they all refer to the same thing.
DNACPR means if your heart or breathing stops your healthcare team will not try to restart it.
A DNACPR decision is made by you and/or your doctor or healthcare team. This is explained in more detail in the following section ""When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?"".
A DNACPR decision is usually recorded on a special form. Different doctors or hospitals might use different forms, but they all serve the same purpose. Some examples are a DNACPR form, a treatment escalation plan, or a recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) process.
All these forms are easily recognised by doctors, nurses and healthcare workers, so they know what to do in an emergency.
This form is kept in your medical records. It may also be printed and kept with you if you are at home or in a care home.
You and the people important to you should know that a DNACPR form has been put in your medical records.
The form says that if your heart or breathing stop, CPR should not be tried. This means medical staff will not try to restart your heart or breathing.
Important
DNACPR is about CPR only. It does not mean that you will not get care and treatment. You will continue to have all the other appropriate care, treatment and support you need."
When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?,"There are different situations when a DNACPR decision might be made.
You decide – deciding in advance to refuse CPR
Everyone who has capacity to do so can refuse CPR if they wish.
This is a choice you can make at any time, for example when you are healthy or when you are approaching the end of your life.
You can make it clear to your doctor or medical team that you do not want CPR if your heart or breathing stops.
Your doctor may complete a DNACPR form to indicate this and put it in your medical records.
If you wish to make your refusal of CPR legally binding for when in the future you are unable to make this decision, then you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains to a doctor or medical team when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatments).
You can change your mind about your DNACPR decision at any time. If you do, you need to tell your doctors and nurses so that the DNACPR form is marked as no longer valid. The fact that you once had a DNACPR form will still be recorded on your records so that doctors and nurses can see your full medical history and know about conversations that happened in the past.
A doctor decides in advance
DNACPR is a medical treatment decision that can be made by your doctor even if you do not agree.
You must be told that a DNACPR form will be/has been completed for you, but a doctor does not need your consent. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.
You should be given the chance to understand what a DNACPR is, how the decision is made and why they think CPR would not be suitable for you. For example, your doctor may think that CPR will not help you live longer or that giving you CPR could cause you more harm. This may be because your organs are already too damaged because of another illness or you are approaching the end of your life.
You should then be consulted, and doctors should ask about your wishes and preferences. Your doctor makes the final decision.
Doctors do not have to give you treatment if they think it will not work.
A DNACPR decision must be made on an individual (person by person) basis. This means it must be based on your health, needs and priorities as an individual. The judgement about whether the discussion or decision would cause you harm should also be made on an individual basis.
DNACPR decisions should not be made for a group of people at once. For example, DNACPR decisions should not be made for everyone living in a care home or for a group of people over a certain age. This is unlawful, irrespective of medical condition, age, disability, race or language.
Learning disability, autism or dementia are not reasons to put a DNACPR on someone's record.
If you disagree with a DNACPR decision that a doctor has made, you can ask for a second opinion and a review. You cannot demand CPR. The law does not require your consent to a DNACPR. The law does provide you with the right to be involved in, and informed of, a doctor's DNACPR decision."
What happens if you are unable to make or discuss a DNACPR decision in advance of your heart stopping?,"Some people cannot make decisions about CPR for themselves. If you have been assessed as unable to make a specific decision for yourself, you will be referred to as ""lacking capacity"".
If you lack capacity to decide about CPR, doctors should first check to see if you have an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT) that says that you do not want CPR. They should also check to see if you have a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and care decisions.
An LPA is a document that explains who you have chosen to help you make decisions or who can make decisions for you. Your chosen person(s) are known as ""attorneys"". If you would like your LPA to make decisions about CPR, then you must complete and sign the section on life-sustaining treatment in the LPA document.
An LPA (with the right to make decisions on life-sustaining treatment) means if you lack the relevant capacity, your attorney can make the decision relating to CPR in your best interests. Your attorney cannot insist on CPR being given.
If you do not have an ADRT (which says that you do not want CPR) or an LPA (with life-sustaining treatment decision-making powers) then a best interest's decision is made by the senior doctor.
This doctor must ask the people who are important to you about your wishes and preferences. This includes anyone with the legal power to represent you, such as a personal welfare deputy, special guardian or – for children and young people under 16 – a parent.
If you do not have family or friends appropriate to ask, then the doctor should ask an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to represent you in the decision-making process. The doctor should also ask members of your healthcare (multidisciplinary) team for their views.
Information:
Further information
GOV.UK: Deputies - make decisions for someone who lacks capacity
GOV.UK: Become a special guardian"
How long does a DNACPR form last?,"A DNACPR form can be written for a short period – for example, if you have been admitted to hospital. Or it can be written with no end date – for example, if you have a long-term condition that has damaged your heart, lungs or other organs – only being reviewed if your situation changes.
When the DNACPR decision is made you should be told when it will be reviewed, and this is usually recorded on the form. It's recommended that a DNACPR is reviewed each time your situation changes – for example, when you leave hospital. If a DNACPR form is placed on your medical records while in hospital, this will be included in your discharge summary and shared with your GP."
Is a DNACPR form legally binding?,"A DNACPR form is not legally binding. It's a tool to tell doctors, nurses or paramedics not to attempt CPR.
If you wish to make your DNACPR decision legally binding, you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatment)."
Talking about a DNACPR,"You do not have to talk about DNACPR if you do not want to. If you would prefer not to talk about it, you can let your doctors and nurses know. You could ask your doctors and nurses to make it clear on your record. If you change your mind and want to talk about it, you can.
If a decision needs to be made about CPR, your doctors can still decide to complete a form even if you ask not to talk about it. Your doctor will do this if they believe that CPR would not prolong your life or would do you more harm than good.
Even if you ask not to be involved in the decision, you should be told if a DNACPR form is written and placed on your medical records. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm."
What should you do if you are concerned about a DNACPR form in your medical record or on somebody else's (such as a relative)?,"If you are concerned about a DNACPR form, you should first raise those concerns with your doctor.
If you are still not happy, then you can ask for another doctor's opinion.
If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity to make their own decisions, they will need to agree to it being discussed with you. If you do not have capacity, your family, friends or those with the legal power to represent you (such as a Lasting Power of Attorney) can raise concerns on your behalf.
It's important to understand that nobody has the right to demand CPR, so the decision may not change if there was a good clinical reason for it (for example, your heart, lungs or other organs are struggling to work). The doctor should explain their reasons and ask about your wishes and preferences.
If the DNACPR form was made by a GP, and you are not happy with their response, you should follow the practice's complaints procedure. If you are still concerned, or you wish to make a complaint, contact NHS England and NHS Improvement.
If the DNACPR form was made by a doctor in a hospital, and you are not happy with their response, you can ask to speak to the senior doctor on duty or the consultant responsible for your care. The hospital should have its own complaints procedure. This will tell you how to make a complaint.
If your DNACPR form was made by a GP or doctor in a hospital, you can contact your local Healthwatch to find out about how to get help making a complaint. You can also have support from an advocate if you want help to make a complaint about your GP or a doctor in the hospital.
If you are still not happy with the response you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman."
Check if you have double vision,"Double vision is when you look at 1 object but can see 2 images. It may affect 1 eye or both eyes.
Children often cannot tell if they have double vision. Signs that your child may have problems with their vision include:
narrowing or squinting their eyes to try to see better
closing 1 eye or covering 1 eye with their hand
turning their head in unusual ways (for example, tilting their head)
looking at you sideways instead of facing forward"
What happens at your appointment,"If you have double vison, an optician or GP can ask about your symptoms and do some simple, painless eye tests.
They may refer you to an eye specialist in hospital for tests and treatment.
The optician can also let you know if you need to see a GP instead."
Treating double vision,"Your eyecare team or GP can advise you about the best treatment for double vision once they work out the cause.
In some cases, this may be simple treatments such as eye exercises, wearing an eye patch or being prescribed glasses or contact lenses.
Some conditions that cause double vision may require eye surgery to correct the problem."
Causes of double vision,"Double vision has many possible causes, depending on whether 1 eye or both eyes are affected.
Information:
Try covering 1 eye at a time to see if your double vision goes away.
If your double vision goes away with 1 eye covered, it's probably affecting both eyes (binocular).
If you still have double vision in the eye that is not covered, it's probably only affecting that eye (monocular).
Double vision affecting both eyes (binocular)
Double vision affecting both eyes is usually a symptom of a squint.
This is where problems with the eye muscles or nerves cause the eyes to look in slightly different directions.
Squints are more common in children, but they do not always cause double vision. An untreated squint in children under 7 causes a lazy eye instead.
Squints or binocular double vision in adults can be a sign of a more serious condition.
Double vision affecting 1 eye (monocular)
Double vision affecting 1 eye is less common. It's usually caused by eye problems such as:
dry eyes – where the eyes do not produce enough tears
astigmatism – a common condition where part of the eye is not a perfect shape
cataracts – cloudy patches over the front of the eyes
keratoconus – where the clear outer layer of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and changes shape"
What it's like to have Down's syndrome,"People with Down's syndrome will have some level of learning disability. This means they'll have a range of abilities.
Some people will be more independent and do things like get a job. Other people might need more regular care.
But, like everyone, people with Down's syndrome have:
their own personalities
things they like and dislike
things that make them who they are

Having a baby with Down's syndrome,"In almost all cases, Down's syndrome does not run in families.
Your chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome increases as you get older, but anyone can have a baby with Down's syndrome.
Speak to a GP if you want to find out more. They may be able to refer you to a genetic counsellor.
Screening
If you're pregnant, you'll be offered a screening test to find out your chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome.
You'll be offered the test between weeks 10 and 14 of pregnancy. It involves an ultrasound scan with a blood test. The blood test can be carried out at the same time as the 12-week scan.
If you have a higher chance, you can have further tests.
Important
It's your choice whether or not to have any screening tests.
Information:

Check if you have dry eyes,"You may have dry eyes if your eyes are:
itchy
sore
gritty
red
blurry
sensitive to light
more watery than normal"
Causes of dry eyes,"You can get dry eyes if you do not make enough tears or your tears dry up quickly.
You may be more likely to get dry eyes if:
you're over the age of 50
you wear contact lenses
you look at computer screens for a long time without a break
you spend time in air conditioned or heated environments
it's windy, cold, dry or dusty
you smoke or drink alcohol
you take certain medicines (for example, some antidepressants or blood pressure medicines)
you have a condition, such as blepharitis, Sjögren's syndrome or lupus"
How to treat dry eyes yourself,"Do
clean your eyelids every day
take breaks to rest your eyes when using a computer screen
make sure your computer screen is just below eye level
use a humidifier to stop the air getting dry
if you wear contact lenses, take them out and wear glasses to rest your eyes
How to clean your eyelids
Don’t
do not smoke or drink too much alcohol
do not spend too long in smoky, dry or dusty places
do not spend too long in air conditioned or heated rooms
do not stop taking a prescribed medicine without getting medical advice first – even if you think it's causing your symptoms
A pharmacist may be able to help with dry eyes
A pharmacist may be able to tell you:
what you can do to treat it yourself – such as cleaning and protecting your eyes
if you can buy anything to help – such as eye drops, gels, ointments or allergy medicines
if you need to see an optician or GP
Find a pharmacy"
Things you can try if you have sore or dry lips,"Do
use a lip balm containing petroleum jelly or beeswax – you can buy these at a pharmacy or supermarket
try a few different lip balms if one is not working for you – some people may be sensitive to some fragrances, dyes or cosmetic ingredients
wash your hands before applying lip balm
use a lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more every 2 hours when outdoors
cover your lips with a scarf when you're outside in cold weather
drink plenty of water to avoid becoming dehydrated
Don’t
do not pick or bite any flaky skin on your lips – this can slow down healing
do not keep licking dry or cracked lips – this can make them sore
do not share lip balms with other people – this can spread germs
A pharmacist can help with sore or dry lips
A pharmacist can advise you about:
the best treatments for dry or sore lips
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Common causes of sore or dry lips,"Sore or dry lips can be caused by many things.
Common causes include:
cold weather, dry air or wind
damage from the sun
dehydration
a lip injury
allergies
Sometimes they can be caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals.
If you have a small, fluid-filled blister on your lip, you may have a cold sore.
Most people with cold sores get a tingling, burning or itching feeling on their lip before the blister appears."
Causes of a dry mouth,"The main causes of a dry mouth are:
dehydration – for example, from not drinking enough, sweating a lot or being ill
medicines – check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if dry mouth is a side effect
breathing through your mouth at night – this can happen if you have a blocked nose or you sleep with your mouth open
anxiety
cancer treatment (radiotherapy or chemotherapy)
oral thrush (mouth thrush)
Sometimes a dry mouth that does not go away may be caused by a condition like diabetes or Sjögren's syndrome."
How to help ease a dry mouth yourself,"Do
drink plenty of cold water – take regular sips during the day and keep some water by your bed at night
suck on ice cubes or ice lollies
sip on cold unsweetened drinks
chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free sweets
use lip balm if your lips are also dry
brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash – you're more likely to get tooth decay if you have a dry mouth
Don’t
do not drink lots of alcohol, caffeine (such as tea and coffee) or fizzy drinks
do not eat foods that are acidic (like lemons), spicy, salty or sugary
do not smoke
do not sleep with dentures in
do not use acidic artificial saliva products if you have your own teeth
do not stop taking a prescribed medicine without getting medical advice first – even if you think it might be causing your symptoms"
A pharmacist can help if you have a dry mouth,"If you have a dry mouth, ask a pharmacist about treatments you can buy to help keep your mouth moist.
You can get:
gels
sprays
tablets or lozenges
Not all products are suitable for everyone. Ask a pharmacist for advice about the best one for you.
If your dry mouth might be caused by a blocked nose, a pharmacist may suggest decongestants to unblock it."
Check if you have Dupuytren's contracture,"Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers. You can have it in both hands at the same time.
It tends to get slowly worse over many months or years. Treatment cannot usually help in the early stages."
Treatments for Dupuytren's contracture,"Speak to a specialist about the options, what the benefits and risks are, and what to expect afterwards.
Your finger may not be completely straight after treatment, and might not be as strong and flexible as it used to be.
The contracture could also come back after a few years.
There are 3 main types of treatment.
Surgery to straighten the fingers
Fasciectomy
A cut is made along your palm and finger so the surgeon can straighten it.
general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
you can leave hospital the same day
recovery time: 4 to 12 weeks
lowest risk of contracture coming back
risks include bleeding, numbness and infection
Using a needle to straighten the fingers
Needle fasciotomy
A needle is inserted into several places along your palm and finger to loosen and straighten it.
local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
you can leave hospital the same day
recovery time: up to 2 weeks
contracture more likely to come back than with surgery
risks include a cut opening up in your skin, pain and numbness
Using surgery and a skin graft to straighten the fingers
Dermafasciectomy
Similar to a fasciectomy, except an additional area of skin is removed; a skin graft from elsewhere in the body can be used to replace the removed skin.
general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
2 procedures are needed – 1 to straighten the fingers and then around 4 days later, another procedure to add the skin graft
contractures less likely to come back than with a standard fasciectomy but recovery times can be longer
risks include bleeding, numbness and infection"
Causes and preventing Dupuytren's contracture,"Dupuytren's contracture happens when the tissue under the skin near your fingers becomes thicker and less flexible.
The exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to:
having a family history of the condition
smoking
drinking lots of alcohol
having diabetes or epilepsy
It's not known if you can prevent it or stop it coming back."
Symptoms of DVT (deep vein thrombosis),"Symptoms of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) in the leg are:
throbbing pain in 1 leg (rarely both legs), usually in the calf or thigh, when walking or standing up
swelling in 1 leg (rarely both legs)
warm skin around the painful area
red or darkened skin around the painful area – this may be harder to see on brown or black skin
swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them
These symptoms can also happen in your arm or tummy if that's where the blood clot is.
Credit:"
Who is more likely to get DVT (deep vein thrombosis),"A DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is more likely to happen if you:
are over 60
are overweight
smoke
have had DVT before
take the contraceptive pill or HRT
have cancer or heart failure
have varicose veins
There are also some times when you have a higher chance of getting DVT.
These include if you:
are staying in or recently left hospital – especially if you cannot move around much (like after an operation)
are confined to bed
go on a long journey (more than 3 hours) by plane, car or train
are pregnant or if you've had a baby in the previous 6 weeks
are dehydrated
Sometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason."
How DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is diagnosed,"If a doctor thinks you have DVT (deep vein thrombosis), you should be referred to hospital within 24 hours for an ultrasound scan. The scan shows whether blood is flowing normally through the vein.
You may also have an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you'll be injected with a dye to show where the blood clot is."
Treatment of DVT (deep vein thrombosis),"You may have an injection of a blood-thinning medicine called heparin while you're waiting for an ultrasound scan to see if you have a DVT (deep vein thrombosis).
The main treatments include:
blood-thinning medicines, such as warfarin or rivaroxaban – you'll probably need to take these for at least 3 months
surgery to remove blood clots or stop them forming
If you get a DVT when you're pregnant, you'll have injections for the rest of the pregnancy and until your baby is 6 weeks old."
Recovery from DVT (deep vein thrombosis),"There are things you can do to help you recover from DVT (deep vein thrombosis).
After you leave hospital, you'll be encouraged to:
walk regularly
keep your affected leg raised when you're sitting
delay any flights or long journeys until at least 2 weeks after you start taking blood-thinning medicine"
How to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis),"There are things you can do to lower your chance of getting DVT (deep vein thrombosis).
Do
stay a healthy weight
stay active – taking regular walks can help
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – DVT is more likely if you're dehydrated
Don’t
do not sit still for long periods of time – get up and move around every hour or so
do not cross your legs while you're sitting
do not smoke
do not drink lots of alcohol
Going on a long journey
If you're travelling for 3 hours or more by plane, train or car, there are things you can do during the journey to lower your chances of getting DVT.
These include:
wearing loose clothing
drinking plenty of water
avoiding alcohol
walking around when possible
Going into hospital
If you go into hospital, your healthcare team should check if there's a higher chance you'll get DVT.
If they think you're more likely to get DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it, such as medicine or compression stockings (knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation), while you're in hospital.
You may continue treatment after you leave hospital because a blood clot can happen weeks later.
You can also help protect yourself against DVT while you're in hospital by:
staying active and walking around if you can
moving your toes (up and down) and ankles (in circles) if you have to stay in bed – your healthcare team may give you some exercises to do"
What causes restricted growth?,"Causes of PSS
The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it's sometimes the result of the body not producing enough growth hormone.
Certain genetic syndromes, such as Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, can also cause PSS.
Causes of DSS
A rare genetic condition called achondroplasia is the most common cause of DSS.
It causes poor bone growth, resulting in short upper arms and thighs.
It doesn't always run in the family – many children with achondroplasia have parents of normal height.
The Restricted Growth Association UK has more information about achondroplasia and other rare types of restricted growth."
Diagnosing restricted growth,"Restricted growth may be diagnosed before a child is born, soon afterwards, or when growth problems become more obvious as they get older.
Growth hormone deficiency is usually diagnosed using growth hormone stimulation tests.
Medicine is injected into a vein or muscle to cause an increase in growth hormone levels in the blood. A lower than normal level indicates a deficiency in growth hormone.
A brain scan will be needed to look at the pituitary gland (which produces growth hormone) if blood tests show low levels of growth hormone.
If one or both parents have a family history of a condition that causes short stature, their baby can be tested for this during pregnancy (prenatal diagnosis).
Read more about screening tests in pregnancy."
Treatment for restricted growth,"Treatment with growth hormone injections may benefit some people with restricted growth and can help a child with the condition grow more than they otherwise would.
In cases of DSS where the legs are particularly short, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, but there's some uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness.
Read more about treatments for restricted growth."
Check if it's dysarthria,"The main symptom of dysarthria is unclear speech. This can make it difficult for you to make yourself understood.
Your speech may only be slightly unclear, or you may not be able to speak clearly at all.
Other symptoms include:
difficulty moving your mouth, tongue or lips
slurred or slow speech
difficulty controlling the volume of your voice, making you talk too loudly or quietly
a change in your voice, making it nasal, strained or monotone
hesitating a lot when talking, or speaking in short bursts instead of full sentences
Being stressed or tired may make your symptoms worse.
Information:
Dysarthria is not the same as dysphasia, although you can have both conditions at the same time. Dysphasia, also known as aphasia, is where you have difficulty understanding words or putting them together in a sentence."
Causes of dysarthria,"Dysarthria is usually caused by damage to the brain or conditions that affect the nervous system. It can happen at any age.
Common causes include:
stroke, severe head injury and brain tumours
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease
cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome
It can also be a side effect of certain medicines, such as some medicines to treat epilepsy."
Treatment for dysarthria,"If you have dysarthria, you'll usually be referred to a speech and language therapist. They'll offer therapy to help your speech and communication.
The therapy you're offered will be different depending on the cause of your dysarthria and how severe it is.
Some people may find therapy does not help their symptoms, or their speech may get worse as their condition progresses. Their therapy may focus on helping communication in other ways.
Speech and language therapy may include:
exercises to strengthen the muscles used for speech
strategies to make your speech easier to understand, such as slowing down when you're talking
using communication aids, such as an alphabet board or a voice amplifier"
Types of dysentery,"There are 2 main types of dysentery:
bacillary dysentery or shigellosis, which is caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK
amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis, which is caused by an amoeba (single celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, which is mainly found in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad"
Treating dysentery,"As dysentery usually gets better on its own after 3 to 7 days, treatment is not usually needed.
However, it's important to drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions if necessary to avoid dehydration.
Painkillers, such as paracetamol, can help relieve pain and a fever. Avoid anti-diarrhoea medicines, such as loperamide, because they can make things worse.
You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others."
How you can avoid passing on dysentery,"Handwashing is the most important way to stop the spread of infection. You're infectious to other people while you're ill and have symptoms.
Take the following steps to avoid passing the illness on to others:
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after going to the toilet. Read more about how to wash your hands.
Stay away from work or school until you've been completely free from any symptoms for at least 48 hours.
Help young children to wash their hands properly.
Do not prepare food for others until you've been free of symptoms for at least 48 hours.
Do not go swimming until you've been free of symptoms for at least 48 hours.
Where possible, stay away from other people until your symptoms have stopped.
Wash all dirty clothes, bedding and towels on the hottest cycle of your washing machine.
Clean toilet seats and toilet bowls, flush handles, taps and sinks with detergent and hot water after use, followed by a household disinfectant.
Avoid sexual contact until you've been free of symptoms for at least 48 hours.
As shigella is easily passed on to others, you may need to submit poo (stool) samples to be given the all clear to return to work, school or nursery.
The type of shigella you have and whether you, or others, are in a risk group will influence how long you need to stay away.
Risk groups are people with certain jobs (including healthcare workers and people who handle food), as well as people who need help with personal hygiene and very young children. Your environmental health officer will be able to advise you about this."
When to see a GP,"It's not always necessary to see a GP if you have dysentery, because it tends to get better within a week or so.
However, you should see a GP if your symptoms are severe or they do not start to improve after a few days. Let them know if you've been abroad recently.
If your symptoms are severe or persistent, a GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. If you have very severe dysentery, you may need treatment in hospital for a few days."
Reducing your risk of catching dysentery,"You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery by:
washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and regularly throughout the day
washing your hands before handling, eating or cooking food
avoiding sharing towels
washing the laundry of an infected person on the hottest setting possible
If you're travelling to a country where there's a high risk of getting dysentery, this advice can help prevent infection:
Do not drink the local water unless you're sure it's clean (sterile) – drink bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles.
If the water is not sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter.
Do not clean your teeth with tap water.
Do not have ice in your drinks because it may be made from unclean water.
Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that cannot be peeled before you eat them.
Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors, except drinks in properly sealed cans or bottles."
What causes dysentery?,"Bacillary and amoebic dysentery are both highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo (faeces) of an infected person gets into another person's mouth.
This can happen if someone with the infection does not wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces or another person.
In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people who are in close contact, such as in families, schools and nurseries.
There's also a chance of getting the infection through anal or anal oral sex (rimming).
In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food, particularly cold uncooked food."
What are the signs of dyslexia?,"Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write.
A person with dyslexia may:
read and write very slowly
confuse the order of letters in words
be confused by letters that look similar and write letters the wrong way round (such as ""b"" and ""d"")
have poor or inconsistent spelling
understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that's written down
find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions
struggle with planning and organisation
But people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving.
Read more about the symptoms of dyslexia."
Getting help,"If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about your concerns.
They may be able to offer additional support to help your child if necessary.
If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to consider requesting an in-depth assessment from a specialist in assessing specific learning difficulties (SpLD), an educational psychologist or a speech and language therapist.
This can be arranged through the school, or you can request a private assessment by contacting:
an educational psychologist directly (see the directory of chartered psychologists on the British Psychological Society's website)
a voluntary organisation that can arrange an assessment or share details of a qualified assessor in your area, such as the British Dyslexia Association, The Dyslexia Association, or Patoss
Adults who wish to be assessed for dyslexia should contact a local or national dyslexia association for advice.
Read more about how dyslexia is diagnosed."
Support for people with dyslexia,"If your child has dyslexia, they'll probably need extra educational support from their school.
With appropriate support, there's usually no reason your child can't go to a mainstream school, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school.
Techniques and support that may help your child include:
occasional 1-to-1 teaching or lessons in a small group with a specialist teacher
phonics (a way of teaching children to identify and process the smaller sounds that make up words) combined with other techniques
technology like computers and speech-recognition software that may make it easier for your child to read and write when they're a bit older
Schools and colleges must offer support to students with a specific learning difficulty like dyslexia, and have access to specialist staff who are trained in helping students with special education needs.
Assistive technologies such as speech-recognition software, word processors and electronic organisers can be useful for adults, too.
Employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace to help people with dyslexia, such as allowing extra time for certain tasks.
Read more about how dyslexia is managed."
What causes dyslexia?,"People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these to letters.
Dyslexia isn't related to a person's general level of intelligence. Children and adults of all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia.
The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it often appears to run in families.
It's thought certain genes inherited from your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of the brain develop during early life."
Check if it's dysphagia,"Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or drinks, while others cannot swallow at all.
Signs of dysphagia include:
coughing or choking when eating or drinking
bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose
a feeling that food is stuck in your throat or chest
a gurgly, wet-sounding voice when eating or drinking
You may also drool and have problems chewing your food.
Over time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss, dehydration and repeated chest infections."
Causes of dysphagia,"Dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition and can happen at any age.
Common causes of swallowing problems include:
some medicines, such as antipsychotics
having a learning disability
a cleft lip and palate in babies
heartburn and acid reflux, especially in children or people who have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
problems with your breathing caused by conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
a condition that affects the nervous system or brain, such as cerebral palsy, a stroke, dementia or multiple sclerosis
cancer, such as mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer"
Treatments for dysphagia,"Your GP will examine you and may refer you to a specialist for further tests.
You may also be referred to a speech and language therapist or a dietitian for advice about swallowing and your diet.
Treatment for dysphagia depends on what's causing it and how severe it is.
If your swallowing problems are being caused by a condition like acid reflux, the problem may get better on its own.
But if the cause is longer term, you may need specialist treatment to make eating and drinking as safe as possible.
This may include:
medicines to treat acid reflux
swallowing therapy with a speech and language therapist
making changes to what you eat and drink, such as softer foods and using thickener in drinks
using special spoons, plates and cups
feeding tubes through your nose or a hole into your stomach
surgery to widen your oesophagus
injections to relax the muscles in your oesophagus and allow food and drink to reach the stomach"
Symptoms of dyspraxia,"Symptoms of dyspraxia can vary between individuals and may change over time. You may find routine tasks difficult.
If you have dyspraxia it may affect:
your co-ordination, balance and movement
how you learn new skills, think, and remember information at work and home
your daily living skills, such as dressing or preparing meals
your ability to write, type, draw and grasp small objects
how you function in social situations
how you deal with your emotions
time management, planning and personal organisation skills
Dyspraxia should not be confused with other disorders affecting movement, such as cerebral palsy and stroke. It can affect people of all intellectual abilities."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you think you may have undiagnosed dyspraxia or problems with your co-ordination. It's a good idea to keep a diary of your symptoms. 
The GP may refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist for tests. They'll assess your movements and how your symptoms are affecting you before making a diagnosis. 
If you have dyspraxia, you may also have other conditions, such as:
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
dyslexia
autism spectrum disorder
difficulty learning or understanding maths (dyscalculia)
depression or anxiety"
Causes of dyspraxia,"It's not known what causes dyspraxia. You may be at a higher risk of developing it if you were born prematurely.
Dyspraxia is more common in men and often runs in families."
Treatment for dyspraxia,"There is no cure for dyspraxia but there are therapies that can help with daily living, such as:
occupational therapy – to help you find practical ways to remain independent and manage everyday tasks such as writing or preparing food
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave
It may also help if you:
keep fit – you may find regular exercise helps with co-ordination, reduces feelings of fatigue and prevents you gaining weight
learn how to use a computer or laptop if writing by hand is difficult
use a calendar, diary or app to improve your organisation
learn how to talk positively about your challenges and how you've overcome them
get support from programmes such as Access to Work from Jobcentre Plus"
Support for people living with dyspraxia,"Dyspraxia can have a big effect on your life, but support is available to help you manage your condition.
It might help to talk to others with dyspraxia or to connect with a charity.
You may find these charity and forum links useful:
Dyspraxia Foundation – it has a list of local support groups you can join to share your experiences with others
Dyspraxic Adults – a forum for adults with dyspraxia"
Check if you have dystonia,"Dystonia can affect your whole body or just 1 part. It can start at any age.
Symptoms of dystonia include:
uncontrolled muscle cramps and spasms
parts of your body twisting into unusual positions – such as your neck being twisted to the side or your feet turning inwards
shaking (tremors)
uncontrolled blinking
The symptoms may be continuous or come and go. They may be triggered by things like stress or certain activities.
What can trigger dystonia symptoms"
How dystonia is diagnosed,"P if:
you think you might have dystonia
Dystonia is uncommon, but it's best to get the symptoms checked out.
How dystonia is diagnosed
If your GP thinks you could have dystonia, they may refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for tests.
To diagnose dystonia, a neurologist may:
ask about your symptoms
ask about any other conditions you have and if anyone else in your family has dystonia (sometimes it can be inherited)
carry out some blood and urine tests
arrange a brain scan to look for any problems
If you're diagnosed with dystonia, your neurologist can tell you which type you have and what your treatment options are.
Main types of dystonia"
Treatments for dystonia,"Treatment can help relieve the symptoms of dystonia. The best option for you depends on the type of dystonia you have.
The main treatments for dystonia are:
injections of a medicine called botulinum toxin directly into the affected muscles – these need to be repeated about every 3 months
medicine to relax the muscles in a larger part of your body – given as tablets or injections into a vein
a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation
Physiotherapy and occupational therapy may also help.
Surgery for dystonia
Deep brain stimulation is the main type of surgery for dystonia. It may be offered on the NHS if other treatments do not help.
It involves inserting a small device, similar to a pacemaker, under the skin of your chest or tummy.
The device sends electrical signals along wires placed in the part of the brain that controls movement.
Read more on deep brain stimulation from Dystonia UK"
Living with dystonia,"Dystonia affects people in different ways. The severity of symptoms can vary from one day to another.
It can have a big effect on your life and make daily activities painful and difficult.
It's usually a lifelong condition. It may get worse for a few years but then remain steady. Occasionally, it can improve over time.
Information:
You can get support if you live with dystonia from Dystonia UK."
Causes of dystonia,"Dystonia is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls movement.
Often the cause is unknown.
Sometimes it can be due to:
an inherited genetic problem
Parkinson's disease
a stroke
cerebral palsy
multiple sclerosis"
Check if it's an ear infection,"The symptoms of an ear infection usually start quickly and include:
pain inside the ear
a high temperature
being sick
a lack of energy
difficulty hearing
discharge running out of the ear
a feeling of pressure or fullness inside the ear
itching and irritation in and around the ear
scaly skin in and around the ear
Young children and babies with an ear infection may also:
rub or pull their ear
not react to some sounds
be irritable or restless
be off their food
keep losing their balance
Most ear infections clear up within 3 days, although sometimes symptoms can last up to a week.
If you, or your child, have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better."
How to treat an ear infection yourself,"To help relieve any pain and discomfort from an ear infection:
Do
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (children under 16 should not take aspirin)
place a warm or cold flannel on the ear
remove any discharge by wiping the ear with cotton wool
Don’t
do not put anything inside your ear to remove earwax, such as cotton buds or your finger
do not let water or shampoo get in your ear
do not use decongestants or antihistamines – there's no evidence they help with ear infections"
A pharmacist can help with an ear infection,"Speak to a pharmacist if you think you have an ear infection.
They can recommend eardrops to help stop bacteria or fungus spreading. They can also provide other treatments if you need them, without you seeing a GP.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment from a GP,"The GP may prescribe medicine for your ear infection, depending on what's caused it.
Infections inside the ear
Antibiotics are not usually offered because infections inside the ear often clear up on their own and antibiotics make little difference to symptoms, including pain.
Antibiotics might be prescribed if:
an ear infection does not start to get better after 3 days
you or your child has any fluid coming out of the ear
there are other factors that increase your or your child’s risk of complications, such as having a weakened immune system
They may also be prescribed if your child is less than 2 years old and has an infection in both ears.
If antibiotics are not prescribed, eardrops containing a painkiller and an anaesthetic might be prescribed.
Outer ear infections
The GP might prescribe:
antibiotic eardrops – to treat a bacterial infection
steroid eardrops – to bring down swelling
antifungal eardrops – to treat a fungal infection
antibiotic tablets – if your bacterial infection is severe
If you have a spot or boil in your ear, the GP may pierce it with a needle to drain the pus.
Eardrops may not work if they're not used correctly."
Preventing ear infections,"You cannot always prevent ear infections, particularly inner ear infections caused by colds and flu.
To help avoid inner ear infections:
make sure your child is up to date with vaccinations
keep your child away from smoky environments
try not to give your child a dummy after they're 6 months old
To help avoid outer ear infections:
do not stick cotton wool buds or your fingers in your ears
use earplugs or a swimming hat over your ears when you swim
try to avoid water or shampoo getting into your ears when you have a shower or bath
treat conditions that affect your ears, such as eczema or an allergy to hearing aids"
How long earache lasts,"It depends on what's causing it. Most earaches in children are caused by an ear infection, which usually start to improve after a few days."
Spotting earache in babies and young children,"A young child might have earache if they:
rub or pull their ear
do not react to some sounds
have a temperature of 38C or above
are irritable or restless
are off their food
keep losing their balance
Earache and ear pain can affect 1 or both ears."
How to treat earache yourself,"There are some things you can do to help relieve earache and ear pain.
Do

What causes earache and pain,"Earache and pain can be caused by many things, but sometimes it's not known by what.
Here are some of the most common causes:
Possible causes of earache symptoms.
Symptoms Possible condition
Ear pain with toothache Children teething, dental abscess
Ear pain with change in hearing Glue ear, earwax build-up, an object stuck in the ear (do not try to remove it yourself – see a GP), perforated eardrum (particularly after a loud noise or accident)
Ear pain with pain when swallowing Sore throat, tonsillitis, quinsy (a complication of tonsillitis)
Ear pain with a fever Ear infection, flu, cold"
Check if you have a perforated eardrum,"Symptoms of a perforated eardrum usually start suddenly after an:
ear infection
injury (such as getting hit on your ear)
loud noise
sudden change in air pressure (such as flying on a plane)
Most of the time symptoms affect 1 ear and include:
hearing loss
a ringing or buzzing sound in your ear (tinnitus)
earache or ear pain
itching in your ear
clear fluid, blood or pus leaking from your ear
feeling dizzy
a high temperature"
Treatment for a perforated eardrum,"A perforated eardrum usually gets better on its own within 2 months and your hearing returns to normal.
A GP may prescribe antibiotics if you have an ear infection, or to stop you getting an ear infection while your eardrum heals.
Sometimes, surgery to repair the eardrum (myringoplasty) may be needed if the eardrum is not healing by itself.
Important
Go back to your GP if your symptoms have not started to improve after a few weeks."
Things you can do if you have a perforated eardrum,"There are some things you can do to help heal a perforated eardrum and ease symptoms.
Do
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease any pain
put a large piece of cotton wool covered in petroleum jelly in your outer ear when you wash your hair to stop water getting in
Don’t
do not go swimming or get your ear wet until your eardrum heals
do not put anything inside your ear, such as cotton buds or eardrops (unless a doctor recommends them)
try not to blow your nose too hard because this can damage your eardrum as it heals
Information:
Flying with a perforated eardrum
It's safe to fly if you have a perforated eardrum. But if you've had surgery to repair a perforated eardrum (myringoplasty), do not fly until you're told it's safe to."

Early puberty,"Early puberty, also called precocious puberty, is when:
girls have signs of puberty before 8 years of age
boys have signs of puberty before 9 years of age
Some girls and boys may develop certain signs of puberty at a young age, but not others.
For example, girls may start periods before the age of 8 but have no breast development.
See your GP if this happens to your child.
Causes of early puberty
It's not always clear what causes early puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family.
Occasionally it can be caused by:
a problem in the brain, such as a brain tumour
damage to the brain as a result of an infection, surgery or radiotherapy
a problem with the ovaries or thyroid gland
a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome – read more about McCune-Albright syndrome on the MedlinePlus website
Early puberty mostly affects girls and often has no obvious cause. It's less common in boys and may be more likely to be associated with an underlying problem.
Tests and treatments for early puberty
Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause that needs to be investigated.
Tests that may be carried out include:
a blood test to check hormone levels
a hand X-ray to help determine likely adult height
an ultrasound scan or MRI scan to check for problems such as tumours
Early puberty can be treated by:
treating any underlying cause
using medication to reduce hormone levels and pause sexual development for a few years
Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if it's thought early puberty will cause emotional or physical problems, such as short height in adulthood or early periods in girls, which may cause significant distress."
Delayed puberty,"Delayed puberty is when:
boys have no signs of testicular development by 14 years of age
girls have not started to develop breasts by 13 years of age, or they have developed breasts but their periods have not started by 15
Causes of delayed puberty
It's not always clear what causes delayed puberty. It may just be a tendency that runs in your family. Delayed puberty is generally more common in boys.
Occasionally it can be caused by:
a long-term illness, such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes or kidney disease
malnutrition, possibly from an eating disorder or a condition such as cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease
a problem with the ovaries, testes, thyroid gland or pituitary gland
differences in sex development, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome
a genetic condition, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Kallmann syndrome – read more about Kallmann syndrome on the MedlinePlus website
Tests and treatments for delayed puberty
Your GP may refer you to a specialist if they think there could be an underlying cause of delayed puberty that needs to be investigated.
Tests that may be carried out include a blood test to check hormone levels, a hand X-ray to help determine likely adult height, and an ultrasound or MRI scan to check for problems with glands or organs.
Delayed puberty can be treated by:
treating any underlying cause
using medication for a few months to increase hormone levels and trigger the start of puberty
Treatment with medication is usually only recommended if the lack of development is causing problems, such as significant distress."
Symptoms of earwax build-up,"Symptoms of earwax build-up include:
hearing loss
earache or a feeling that your ears are blocked
ringing or buzzing in your ears (tinnitus)
vertigo (feeling dizzy and sick)"
How you can treat earwax build-up yourself,"Earwax usually falls out on its own. If it does not, and builds up and blocks your ear, you can try to remove it.
To remove earwax build-up:
Lie on your side with the affected ear facing up.
Put 2 to 3 drops of olive or almond oil in your ear – do not use almond oil if you're allergic to almonds.
Continue to lie on your side for 5 to 10 minutes after putting in the oil.
Repeat 3 to 4 times a day, for 3 to 5 days.
Over about 2 weeks, lumps of earwax should fall out of your ear and your symptoms should improve.
There's no evidence that ear candles or ear vacuums get rid of earwax.
Important
Do not use your fingers or any objects like cotton buds to remove earwax. This will push it in and make it worse."
A pharmacist can help with earwax build-up,"Speak to a pharmacist about earwax build-up. They can give advice and suggest treatments.
They might recommend medicines to dissolve the earwax. The earwax should fall out on its own or dissolve after about a week.
Do not use drops if you have a hole in your eardrum (a perforated eardrum).
Find a pharmacy"
GP surgery treatment to remove earwax,"Not all GP surgeries remove earwax build-up.
Some can:
flush the wax out with water (ear irrigation)
suck the wax out (microsuction)
These treatments are usually painless.
You might have to pay to have them done privately."
Causes of earwax build-up,"A build-up of earwax can happen if you have:
narrow or damaged ear canals
lots of hair in your ear canals
a skin condition affecting your scalp or around your ear
inflammation of your ear canal (otitis externa or ""swimmer's ear"")"
Preventing earwax build-up,"You cannot prevent earwax. It's there to protect your ears from dirt and germs.
But regularly using eardrops, or olive or almond oil, will help soften earwax build-up. This will help it fall out on its own and should stop your ears getting blocked."
Check if you're at risk of Ebola,"Ebola is caused by a virus caught from wild animals. It spreads from person to person when you touch infected body fluids, such as semen, saliva, blood, poo, pee and vomit.
There have been outbreaks of the virus in Central and West Africa in the past.
The most recent outbreaks have been in:
Uganda
Guinea
Democratic Republic of Congo
It's never been spread from person to person in the UK."
How to avoid Ebola,"If you're travelling to an area where Ebola is found, get advice from a travel clinic before you go.
It's best to do this at least 4 to 6 weeks before you travel, but you can still get advice at the last minute if you need to.
Do
wash your hands regularly
wash and peel fruit and vegetables before eating them
try to avoid anyone who has symptoms of Ebola
use a condom if you have sex with someone who's recovered from Ebola in the last few months
Don’t
do not touch or eat raw or undercooked meat from wild animals in countries where Ebola is found
do not touch a person, their body fluids (such as vomit) or anything they may have come into contact with (such as clothes and bedding) if they've died from Ebola or have Ebola symptoms
do not touch the body fluids of someone who has Ebola, or anything they may have come into contact with (such as clothes and bedding)
do not handle wild animals, especially bats, monkeys, baboons and chimpanzees"
Symptoms of Ebola,"Ebola symptoms can start between 2 and 21 days after being infected.
They can appear suddenly and include flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, extreme tiredness and a headache.
Other symptoms include:
being sick
diarrhoea and tummy pain
a skin rash
yellowing of the skin and eyes
blood in your poo
lots of bruises all over your body
bleeding from your ears, eyes, nose or mouth"
Treatment for Ebola,"Ebola is an emergency and needs to be treated quickly.
You'll usually be treated in isolation in hospital and will need specialist care in an intensive care unit.
Treatment involves managing your symptoms, such as:
help with breathing
fluids given directly into a vein to stop you becoming dehydrated"
When an echocardiogram is used,"An echocardiogram can help diagnose and monitor certain heart conditions by checking the structure of the heart and surrounding blood vessels, analysing how blood flows through them, and assessing the pumping chambers of the heart.
An echocardiogram can help detect:
damage from a heart attack – where the supply of blood to the heart was suddenly blocked
heart failure – where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure
congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart
problems with the heart valves – problems affecting the valves that control the flow of blood within the heart
cardiomyopathy – where the heart walls become thickened or enlarged
endocarditis – an infection in the lining of the heart which damages the heart valves
An echocardiogram can also help your doctors decide on the best treatment for these conditions."
How an echocardiogram is carried out,"There are several different ways an echocardiogram can be carried out, but most people will have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This procedure is outlined on this page.
You won't usually need to do anything to prepare for the test, unless you're having a transoesophageal echocardiogram.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
Credit:
For a TTE, you'll be asked to remove any clothing covering your upper half before lying down on a bed. You may be offered a hospital gown to cover yourself during the test.
When you're lying down, several small sticky sensors called electrodes will be attached to your chest. These will be connected to a machine that monitors your heart rhythm during the test.
A lubricating gel will be applied to your chest or directly to the ultrasound probe. You'll be asked to lie on your left side and the probe will be moved across your chest.
The probe is attached by a cable to a nearby machine that will display and record the images produced.
You will not hear the sound waves produced by the probe, but you may hear a swishing noise during the scan. This is normal and is just the sound of the blood flow through your heart being picked up by the probe.
The whole procedure will usually take between 15 and 60 minutes, and you'll normally be able to go home shortly afterwards."
Other types of echocardiogram,"There are also several other types of echocardiogram that can be carried out:
a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) – where a small probe is passed down the throat into your food pipe (oesophagus) and sometimes into your stomach (your throat will be numbed with local anaesthetic spray and you'll be given a sedative to help you relax); you may need to avoid eating for several hours before this test
a stress echocardiogram – a TTE, but carried out during or just after a period of exercise on a treadmill or exercise bike, or after being given an injection of a medication that makes your heart work harder
a contrast echocardiogram – where a harmless substance called a contrast agent is injected into your bloodstream before an echocardiogram is carried out; this substance shows up clearly on the scan and can help create a better image of your heart
The type of echocardiogram you will have depends on the heart condition being assessed and how detailed the images need to be.
For example, a stress echocardiogram may be recommended if your heart problem is triggered by physical activity, while the more detailed images produced by a TOE may be more useful in helping plan heart surgery."
Getting your results,"In some cases, it may be possible for the person carrying out the scan to discuss the results with you soon after it's finished.
However, the images from the scan will usually need to be analysed before the results are sent to the doctor who requested the test. Your doctor will then discuss the results with you during your next appointment."
Are there any risks or side effects?,"A standard echocardiogram is a simple, painless, safe procedure. There are no side effects from the scan, although the lubricating gel may feel cold and you may experience some minor discomfort when the electrodes are removed from your skin at the end of the test.
Unlike some other tests and scans, such as X-rays and CT scans, no radiation is used during an echocardiogram. However, there are some risks associated with the less common types of echocardiogram.
You may find the TOE procedure uncomfortable and your throat may feel sore for a few hours afterwards. If you have a sedative, you will not be able to drive for 24 hours after the test as you may still feel drowsy from the sedative. There's also a small chance of the probe damaging your throat.
During a stress echocardiogram, you may feel sick and dizzy, and you may experience some chest pain. There's also a small chance of the procedure triggering an irregular heartbeat or heart attack, but you'll be monitored carefully during the test and it will be stopped if there are signs of any problems.
Some people with certain conditions, or who take certain medicines, cannot have the contrast agent used during a contrast echocardiogram. It can cause side effects, but they're usually mild, such as headache. In rare cases, a serious allergic reaction can occur."
What heart palpitations feel like,"When you have heart palpitations, your heartbeat feels uncomfortable or unusual. You may feel it in your chest, neck or throat.
Your heartbeat may feel like it is:
racing or beating very fast
irregular, with skipped or extra beats (ectopic beats)
pounding or thumping
fluttering
Heart palpitations can last seconds, minutes or longer."
Causes of heart palpitations,"Heart palpitations are common and not usually a sign of anything serious.
Common causes include:
strenuous exercise
lack of sleep
stress and anxiety
medicines (check the leaflet that comes with the medicine)
alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and recreational drugs
Sometimes heart palpitations can be a sign you're going through the menopause. Some people get them during pregnancy.
Less often, they can be caused by a condition such as iron deficiency anaemia, an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia)."
Treatment for heart palpitations,"Treatment for heart palpitations depends on the cause. They often do not need to be treated.
Avoiding things that can trigger palpitations, such as stress, smoking, caffeine and alcohol, can help.
You may have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to help find out what the cause might be. This is a test where small pads are stuck to your skin to check the electrical signals coming from your heart.
If your palpitations are caused by a heart problem, you may need medicines or a procedure to help correct your heartbeat."
Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy,"An ectopic pregnancy doesn't always cause symptoms and may only be detected during a routine pregnancy scan.
If you do have symptoms, they tend to develop between the 4th and 12th week of pregnancy.
Symptoms can include a combination of:
a missed period and other signs of pregnancy
tummy pain low down on one side
vaginal bleeding or a brown watery discharge
pain in the tip of your shoulder
discomfort when peeing or pooing
But these symptoms aren't necessarily a sign of a serious problem. They can sometimes be caused by other problems, such as a stomach bug.
Read more about the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy."
When to get medical advice,"Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if you have a combination of any of the above symptoms and you might be pregnant – even if you haven't had a positive pregnancy test.
An ectopic pregnancy can be serious, so it's important to get advice right away.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and you'll usually need to do a pregnancy test to determine if you could have an ectopic pregnancy.
You may be referred to a specialist early pregnancy clinic for further assessment, where an ultrasound scan and blood tests may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis.
Read more about ectopic pregnancy tests."
When to get emergency help,"Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you experience a combination of:
a sharp, sudden and intense pain in your tummy
feeling very dizzy or fainting
feeling sick
looking very pale
These symptoms could mean that your fallopian tube has split open (ruptured). This is very serious and surgery to repair the fallopian tube needs to be carried out as soon as possible.
A rupture can be life threatening, but fortunately they're uncommon and treatable, if dealt with quickly. Deaths from ruptures are extremely rare in the UK."
How an ectopic pregnancy is treated,"There are 3 main treatments for an ectopic pregnancy:
expectant management – you're carefully monitored and 1 of the treatments below is used if the fertilised egg doesn't dissolve by itself
medicine – an injection of a powerful medicine called methotrexate is used to stop the pregnancy growing
surgery – keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is performed under general anaesthetic to remove the fertilised egg, usually along with the affected fallopian tube
You'll be told about the benefits and risks of each option. In many cases, a particular treatment will be recommended based on your symptoms and the results of the tests you have.
Some treatments may reduce your chances of being able to conceive naturally in the future, although most women will still be able to get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this.
Read more about treating an ectopic pregnancy."
Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy,"Losing a pregnancy can be devastating, and many women feel the same sense of grief as if they had lost a family member or partner.
It's not uncommon for these feelings to last several months, although they usually improve with time. Make sure you give yourself and your partner time to grieve.
If you or your partner are struggling to come to terms with your loss, you may benefit from professional support or counselling. Speak to your GP about this.
Support groups for people who have been affected by loss of a pregnancy can also help.
These include:
The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust
Ectopic Pregnancy Foundation
Miscarriage Association
Cruse Bereavement Care
Read more about dealing with loss and find bereavement support services in your area."
Trying for another baby,"You may want to try for another baby when you and your partner feel physically and emotionally ready.
You'll probably be advised to wait until you've had at least 2 periods after treatment before trying again to allow yourself to recover.
If you were treated with methotrexate, it's usually recommended that you wait at least 3 months because the medicine could harm your baby if you become pregnant during this time.
Most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy will be able to get pregnant again, even if they've had a fallopian tube removed. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use fertility treatment such as IVF.
The chances of having another ectopic pregnancy are higher if you've had one before, but the risk is still small.
If you do become pregnant again, it's a good idea to let your GP know as soon as possible so early scans can be carried out to check everything is OK."
What can cause an ectopic pregnancy?,"In many cases, it's not clear why a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. Sometimes it happens when there's a problem with the fallopian tubes, such as them being narrow or blocked.
The following are all associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy:
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – inflammation of the female reproductive system, usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
previous ectopic pregnancy – the risk of having another ectopic pregnancy is around 10%
previous surgery on your fallopian tubes – such as an unsuccessful female sterilisation procedure
fertility treatment, such as IVF – taking medicine to stimulate ovulation (the release of an egg) can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy
becoming pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) for contraception – it's rare to get pregnant while using these, but if you do you're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy
smoking
increasing age – the risk is highest for pregnant women aged over 35
You can't always prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can reduce your risk by using a condom when not trying for a baby to protect yourself against STIs, and by stopping smoking if you smoke."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you think you have ectropion.
They'll be able to diagnose the problem by examining your eye, and can refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for further assessment and treatment, if necessary.
Contact a GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest A&E, if your eye is very red and painful or you have other symptoms, such as reduced vision or sensitivity to light.
This could be a sign of a more serious problem that requires urgent treatment."
Causes of ectropion,"Ectropion is usually associated with ageing. It can happen as the tissues and muscles of the eyelids become weaker as you get older.
Less common causes of ectropion include:
a problem with the nerves that control the eyelid – this is often seen in a type of facial paralysis called Bell's palsy
a lump, cyst or tumour on the eyelid
damage to the skin around the eyelid as a result of an injury, a burn, a skin condition such as contact dermatitis, or previous surgery
Rarely, ectropion can be present from birth if the muscles under the eyelid do not develop properly."
Treating ectropion,"Treatment for ectropion depends on its severity and the underlying cause. If it's mild, it may not need any treatment.
If ectropion is causing minor problems, a GP or eye specialist can advise you about ways to relieve your symptoms and look after your eyes at home.
Severe ectropion may require an operation to correct the problem.
Looking after your eyes
Your doctor may recommend using eyedrops during the day and eye ointment at night to reduce irritation and keep your eye lubricated.
Try not to wipe your eyes excessively, as this can pull on the eyelid and make the problem worse.
If you need to wipe your eyes, it's best to do this gently and wipe upwards and inwards (towards your nose).
If an operation is recommended, you may be advised to tape your eyelids closed at night with special skin tape as a temporary measure to help protect your eyes while you wait to have surgery.
Surgery
Surgery for ectropion is a relatively minor procedure that takes up to 45 minutes for each eyelid, and is usually carried out under local anaesthetic.
It's normally performed on an outpatient basis, which means you will not need to stay in hospital overnight. You should arrange for a friend or family member to take you home.
Various different techniques can be used, depending on the severity of ectropion and its underlying cause.
Following surgery, a pad will be placed over your eye to protect it. This will need to remain in place for about a day.
A course of antibiotic and steroid drops or ointment will usually be prescribed to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. 
You'll have a follow-up appointment a week or two after your operation. This is to check on the position of your eyelid and sometimes to remove any stitches."
Symptoms of varicose eczema,"Credit:
Credit:
Credit:
The affected skin can change colour and become:
itchy and swollen
dry and flaky
scaly, crusty or blistered
On white skin it looks red or brown. On black or brown skin it tends to look dark brown, purple or grey and can sometimes be more difficult to see.
There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they are more severe.
Your legs may become swollen, especially at the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs.
Some people also have other symptoms, such as:
tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis)
small, white scars (atrophie blanche)
pain
eczema affecting other parts of the body
If varicose eczema is not treated, leg ulcers can develop. These are wounds that form where the skin has become damaged."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. Your doctor will often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at your skin.
A GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema.
To help make a diagnosis, a GP may want to know if you have ever had health conditions such as:
varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins
DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – a blood clot in the veins of your legs
leg ulcers – areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal
cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue
surgery or injury to your legs
A GP may also check the pulse in your feet and may do an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you.
The ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use.
Referral to a specialist
You may be referred to a hospital specialist for further tests. You might see a doctor or surgeon who specialises in conditions affecting blood vessels (vascular specialist), or a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist)."
Causes of varicose eczema,"Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in the leg veins.
When small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards.
This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.
Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly.
Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening, including:
sex – varicose eczema is more common in women
obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins
pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins
a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart)
not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins
having previously had DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – blood clots that develop in leg veins which can damage the valves in your veins
increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation"
Treating varicose eczema,"For most people, treatment involves a combination of:
self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs
emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it from becoming dry
topical corticosteroids – ointments or creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms
compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that squeeze your legs tightly at the foot and ankle and become looser further up your leg, helping to improve your circulation
If these treatments do not help, a GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) in case there's another cause for your symptoms, or if they're concerned you may also have contact dermatitis.
If you have varicose veins, you may be referred to a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins.
Find out more about treating varicose eczema."
Other types of eczema,"Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include:
atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of eczema
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that happens when you come into contact with a particular substance
discoid eczema – a long-term type of eczema that appears as circular or oval patches on the skin"
Cause of Edwards' syndrome,"Each cell in your body usually contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents.
A baby with Edwards' syndrome has 3 copies of chromosome number 18 instead of 2. This affects the way the baby grows and develops. Having 3 copies of chromosome 18 usually happens by chance, because of a change in the sperm or egg before a baby is conceived.
Your chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome increases as you get older, but anyone can have a baby with Edwards' syndrome. The condition does not usually run in families and is not caused by anything the parents have or have not done.
Speak to a GP if you want to find out more. They may be able to refer you to a genetic counsellor.
Types of Edwards' syndrome
The symptoms, and how seriously your baby is affected, usually depend on whether they have full, mosaic, or partial Edwards' syndrome.
Full Edwards' syndrome
Most babies with Edwards' syndrome have an extra chromosome 18 present in all cells. This is called full Edwards' syndrome.
The effects of full Edward's syndrome are often more severe. Sadly, most babies with this form will die before they are born.
Mosaic Edwards' syndrome
A small number of babies with Edwards' syndrome (about 1 in 20) have an extra chromosome 18 in just some cells. This is called mosaic Edwards' syndrome (or sometimes mosaic trisomy 18).
This can lead to milder effects of the condition, depending on the number and type of cells that have the extra chromosome. Most babies with this type of Edward's syndrome who are born alive will live for at least a year, and they may live to adulthood.
Partial Edwards' syndrome
A very small number of babies with Edwards' syndrome (about 1 in 100) have only a section of the extra chromosome 18 in their cells, rather than a whole extra chromosome 18. This is called partial Edwards' syndrome (or sometimes partial trisomy 18).
How partial Edwards' syndrome affects a baby depends on which part of chromosome 18 is present in their cells."
Advice for new parents,"There's support available for whatever you or your baby needs.
All babies born with Edwards' syndrome will have some level of learning disability.
Edwards' syndrome is associated with certain physical features and health problems. Every baby is unique and will have different health problems and needs. They will usually have a low birthweight and may also have a wide range of physical symptoms. They may also have heart, respiratory, kidney or gastrointestinal conditions.
Despite their complex needs, children with Edwards' syndrome can slowly start to do more things.
Like any child they'll:
have their own personality
learn at their own pace
have things that are important and unique to them
Try not to think too far ahead and enjoy time with your baby."
Screening for Edwards' syndrome,"If you're pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. This looks at the chance of your baby having the condition.
This screening test is called the combined test and it works out the chance of a baby having Edwards' syndrome, Down's syndrome and Patau's syndrome.
During the test you'll have a blood test and an ultrasound scan to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck (nuchal translucency).
Read more about screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome at 10 to 14 weeks
If it's not possible to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck, or you're more than 14 weeks pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome as part of your 20-week scan. This is sometimes known as the mid-pregnancy scan. It's an ultrasound scan that looks at how your baby is growing.
Screening cannot identify which form of Edwards' syndrome your baby may have, or how it will affect them.
Read more about the 20-week scan
Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy
If the combined test shows that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome, you'll be offered a test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.
This diagnostic test involves analysing a sample of your baby's cells to check if they have an extra copy of chromosome 18.
There are 2 different ways of getting this sample of cells:
chorionic villus sampling, which collects a sample from the placenta
amniocentesis, which collects a sample of the amniotic fluid from around your baby
These are invasive tests that increase your chance of having a miscarriage. Your doctor will discuss this with you.
Results from the diagnostic test
A specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.
This is a very difficult situation and it's normal to feel a whole range of emotions. It may help to talk to your doctor, family and friends, or partner about what you're thinking and how you're feeling.
If you're told your baby has Edwards' syndrome, either before birth or afterwards, you'll be offered support and information.
You can visit the SOFT UK website for support and more information on Edwards' syndrome, and to contact other families affected by the condition.
You can also contact Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which has information about screening tests and how you might feel if you're told your baby does have, or might have, a problem.
ARC has a helpline that can be reached on 0845 077 2290, or 0207 713 7486 from a mobile, Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm. The helpline is answered by trained staff, who can offer information and support.
Read more about what happens if antenatal screening tests find something"
Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome after birth,"If doctors believe your baby has Edwards' syndrome after they're born, a blood sample will be taken to see if there are extra copies of chromosome 18."
Treating Edwards' syndrome,"There's no cure for Edwards' syndrome.
Treatment will focus on the symptoms of the condition, such as heart conditions, breathing difficulties and infections. Your baby may also need to be fed through a feeding tube, as they can often have difficulty feeding.
Edwards' syndrome has an impact on your baby's movements as they get older, and they may benefit from supportive treatment such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
Depending on your baby's specific symptoms, they may need specialist care in hospital or a hospice, or you may be able to look after them at home with the right support."
Advice for carers,"Supporting someone with Edwards' syndrome can be both rewarding and challenging.
If you need help, or just want someone to talk to, there's lots of support available.
Your guide to social care and support provides lots of advice on how you can take time to look after yourself, including:
getting a break from caring
getting legal support and advocacy
taking care of your wellbeing
Speak to parents and families
It can help to speak to other parents and families who know how you're feeling.
You can do this by:
getting in touch with people on forums and social media
going to a support group – ask your midwife or health visitor about available support groups"
Information about your baby,"If your baby is found to have Edwards' syndrome before or after their birth, their clinical team will pass the information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to treat the symptoms of the condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register at GOV.UK"
Symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS),"There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms.
These include:
an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility)
stretchy skin
fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily
EDS can affect people in different ways. For some, the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling."
Main types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS),"There are 13 types of EDS, most of which are rare.
Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type.
Other types of EDS include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS.
The EDS Support UK website has more information about the different types of EDS
Hypermobile EDS
People with hEDS may have:
joint hypermobility
loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily
joint pain and clicking joints
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
skin that bruises easily
digestive problems, such as heartburn and constipation
dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing up
problems with internal organs, such as mitral valve problems or organ prolapse
problems with bladder control (urinary incontinence)
Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has hEDS.
The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination.
Classical EDS
Classical EDS (cEDS) is less common than hypermobile EDS and tends to affect the skin more.
People with cEDS may have:
joint hypermobility
loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily
stretchy skin
fragile skin that can split easily, especially over the forehead, knees, shins and elbows
smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily
wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars
hernias and organ prolapse
Vascular EDS
Vascular EDS (vEDS) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious.
It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding.
People with vEDS may have:
skin that bruises very easily
thin skin with visible small blood vessels, particularly on the upper chest and legs
fragile blood vessels that can bulge or tear, resulting in serious internal bleeding
a risk of organ problems, such as the bowel tearing, the womb tearing (in late pregnancy) and partial collapse of the lung
hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes), varicose veins and delayed wound healing
Kyphoscoliotic EDS
Kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS) is rare.
People with kEDS may have:
curvature of the spine – this starts in early childhood and often gets worse in the teenage years
joint hypermobility
loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily
weak muscle tone from childhood (hypotonia) – this may cause a delay in sitting and walking, or difficulty walking if symptoms get worse
fragile eyes that can easily be damaged
soft, velvety skin that is stretchy, bruises easily and scars
Hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD)
Some people have problems caused by hypermobility, but do not have any of the specific EDS conditions. They may be diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), which is treated in the same way as hEDS."
Getting medical advice,"See a GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS.
You do not usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems.
Joint hypermobility, for example, is relatively common, affecting around 1 in 30 people. It's unlikely to be caused by EDS if you do not have any other symptoms.
The GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS.
If there's a possibility you may have 1 of the rare types of EDS, the GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment.
The genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis.
If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield or London – see the Annabelle's Challenge website for more information."
Treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS),"There's no specific treatment for EDS, but it's possible to manage many of the symptoms with support and advice.
People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals.
For example:
a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints, avoid injuries and manage pain
an occupational therapist can help you manage daily activities and give advice on equipment that may help you
counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be useful if you're struggling to cope with long-term pain
for certain types of EDS, regular scans carried out in hospital can detect problems with internal organs
genetic counselling can help you learn more about the cause of your condition, how it's inherited, and what the chances are of passing it on to your children
Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services.
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes near you"
Living with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS),"It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury.
But it's also important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life.
Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you:
you may be advised to avoid some activities entirely, such as heavy lifting and contact sports
for some activities you may need to wear appropriate protection and be taught how to reduce the strain on your joints
lower-risk activities, such as swimming or pilates, may be recommended to help you stay fit and healthy
if fatigue is a problem, you can be taught ways to conserve your energy and pace your activities"
How Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are inherited,"EDS can be inherited, but it happen by chance in someone without a family history of the condition.
The 2 main ways EDS is inherited are:
autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) – the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by 1 parent and there's a 1 in 2 chance of each of their children developing the condition
autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) – the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 1 in 4 chance of each of their children developing the condition
A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children.
For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS cannot inherit vascular EDS.
The severity of the condition can vary within the same family."
More information,"The following websites provide more information, advice and support for people with EDS and their families:
Ehlers-Danlos Support UK – you can also call their free helpline on 0800 907 8518 or find local support groups
Hypermobility Syndromes Association (HMSA) – you can also call their helpline on 0333 011 6388 or find local support groups"
Information about you,"If you have EDS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service.
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.
You can opt out of the register at any time."
Premature ejaculation,"Premature ejaculation is a common ejaculation problem. It's where the male ejaculates sooner than he or his partner wishes during sexual arousal.
Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that it happens more than you'd like, and it's a problem for you, it might help to get treatment.
Causes of premature ejaculation 
Various psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation.
Common physical causes include:
prostate problems
thyroid problems – an overactive thyroid or an underactive thyroid
using recreational drugs
Common psychological causes may include:
depression
stress
relationship problems
anxiety about sexual performance (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance)
It's possible for a man to have experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are:
conditioning – it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit
a previous traumatic sexual experience – this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse
a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex
Treating premature ejaculation
Antidepressants
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant, but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include:
paroxetine
sertraline
fluoxetine (Prozac)
Another type of antidepressant called clomipramine is also sometimes used.
Some men may experience an improvement a few days after treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects.
Side effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks. They include:
feeling sick and being sick
diarrhoea
excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
Read more about the side effects of SSRIs.
Dapoxetine (Priligy)
An SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS.
It acts much faster than the other SSRIs used for premature ejaculation and can be used ""on demand"". You'll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day.
Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6 doses), and again every 6 months.
Dapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants.
Common side effects include:
headaches
dizziness
feeling sick
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation.
You can get sildenafil on prescription, or buy it from a pharmacy after a discussion with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe for you to take.
Read more about sildenafil including information on how and when to take it.
Topical anaesthetics and condoms
The use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia.
Things you can try yourself
There are also a number of things you can try yourself. It can sometimes help to:
masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex
use a thick condom to help decrease sensation
have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating)
Psychosexual counselling
You may benefit from having psychosexual counselling, where a therapist can help you, and a partner if you have one, with sex related problems. During these sessions, the therapist will:
encourage you to explore any relationship issues you may have, and give advice about how to resolve them
show you techniques that can help you ""unlearn"" the habit of premature ejaculation (these include the ""squeeze"" and ""stop-go"" techniques)
In the squeeze technique, you masturbate but stop before the point of ejaculation and squeeze the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. Then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur.
The stop-go technique is similar, but you do not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you could try this technique during sex, stopping and starting as required.
These techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice."
Delayed ejaculation,"Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either:
experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation
being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal
You may have delayed ejaculation if you're unable to ejaculate more than half the times you have sex.
Causes of delayed ejaculation
Like premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors.
Possible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation – for example, relationship problems, stress or depression.
Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include:
diabetes
spinal cord injuries
multiple sclerosis
surgery to the bladder or prostate gland
increasing age
Many medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including:
antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
medicines to treat high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers
antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis
Delayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it.
Treating delayed ejaculation
Sex therapy
Sex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex and help make ejaculation easier.
Some integrated care boards (ICBs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live.
You can also pay privately. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area.
The relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres. You'll need to pay for each session. 
During sex therapy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way.
Activities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist).
These may include:
erotic fantasies and ""sex games"" to make your lovemaking more exciting
using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure
Read more information about what a sex therapist can do.
Switching medicine
There are a number of medicines that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include:
amantadine – originally designed to treat viral infections
bupropion – usually prescribed to help people quit smoking
yohimbine – originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction
These help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation.
Alcohol and drugs
Alcohol misuse and recreational drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help.
Read more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use.
Pseudoephedrine
Pseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed ""off-label"". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it has not been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant)."
Retrograde ejaculation,"Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through).
The main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include:
producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation
producing cloudy urine (because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex
Men with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition does not pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child.
Causes of retrograde ejaculation
Retrograde ejaculation happens when the neck of the bladder does not close and semen passes into the bladder.
Usually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm.
However, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra.
Causes of retrograde ejaculation include prostate gland surgery, bladder surgery, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).
Treating retrograde ejaculation
Most men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health.
But if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try.
For example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery.
If retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine.
However, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible.
Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine or testicles for use in intrauterine insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)."
Involve your partner,"If you're having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible.
Communicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them. And, in some cases, your partner may also have their own problems that are contributing towards problems with your sex life.
For example, some women are unable to reach climax during ""normal"" intercourse and require manual or oral stimulation."
Blood in your semen,"Finding blood in your semen can be alarming. However, in most cases it's not serious and will pass within a few days.
It can be caused by an infection of your urethra (urethritis) or prostate (prostatitis).
See your GP if you have blood in your semen. They can check if you need further tests or treatment.
Read more about blood in the semen."
How you can ease elbow and arm pain yourself,"To ease elbow and arm pain, try these things for a couple of days:
put a heat pack or a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel on your arm – do this for 10 to 15 minutes, every few hours
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen
raise your arm if it's swollen"
Causes of elbow and arm pain,"Apart from an injury, these things can cause arm and elbow pain.
Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
Common causes of elbow and arm pain
Main symptoms Possible cause
Pain on the outside of the elbow, difficulty to fully extend the arm
Tennis elbow
Joint pain, stiffness, swelling, difficulty moving the affected area
Tendonitis or bursitis
Pain, tenderness, bruising, swelling
Sprains and strains
Pain, stiffness coming down from the shoulder
Frozen shoulder
Pain and stiffness in the joints
Arthritis
Swelling around a joint, a high temperature or feeling hot and shivery
Joint infection (septic arthritis)"
Why an ECG (electrocardiogram) is done,"You'll usually have an ECG (electrocardiogram) if a doctor or healthcare professional thinks you're having symptoms of:
a heart attack
coronary heart disease
problems with how quickly or regularly your heart beats (arrhythmia)
You also may have an ECG:
if you've been diagnosed with a heart condition or another condition that affects how well your heart works
before and while taking certain medicines"
Preparing for an ECG (electrocardiogram),"There are some things you can do to help you prepare for an ECG (electrocardiogram), such as:
wearing a top that's easy to take on and off
not putting body lotions, oils or talcum powder on your skin before the test
not eating a heavy meal or having caffeine before an exercise ECG (stress test)
Some people may also need to have their chest shaved and cleaned before the test.
Information:
Let the person doing the ECG know if you'd like someone else to be in the room with you (a chaperone). This could be someone you know, another nurse or a trained member of staff."
What happens during an ECG (electrocardiogram),"An ECG (electrocardiogram) is done by a specially trained healthcare professional at a hospital, clinic or GP surgery.
There are 3 different ways an ECG may be done:
while resting
over a period of time, while wearing a portable ECG
while doing exercise or after being given medicine that changes your heart rate (stress test)
The type of ECG you have will depend on your symptoms or condition. The doctor or specialist will explain which you will have and why.
How a resting ECG is done
How a portable ECG is done
How an exercise ECG is done"
Getting your ECG (electrocardiogram) results,"You may get your ECG (electrocardiogram) results on the same day, but it can take a few weeks depending on the type of ECG you had.
You may need a follow-up appointment to talk about your ECG results.
If you've not heard anything after a few weeks, contact the doctor who referred you.
The GP, nurse or specialist should talk to you about your results and explain what happens next.
Sometimes you may need other tests.
Ask to talk to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your results, or do not understand them."
When an EEG is used,"An EEG can be used to help diagnose and monitor a number of conditions affecting the brain.
It may help identify the cause of certain symptoms – such as seizures (fits) or memory problems – or find out more about a condition you've already been diagnosed with.
The main use of an EEG is to detect and investigate epilepsy, a condition that causes repeated seizures. An EEG will help your doctor identify the type of epilepsy you have, what may be triggering your seizures and how best to treat you.
Less often, an EEG may be used to investigate other problems, such as:
dementia
head injury and concussion
brain tumours
encephalitis (brain inflammation)
sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea."
Preparing for an EEG,"Your appointment letter will mention anything you need to do to prepare for the test.
Unless told otherwise, you can usually eat and drink beforehand and continue to take all your normal medication.
To help the sensors stick to your scalp more easily, you should make sure your hair is clean and dry before arriving for your appointment, and avoid using products such as hair gel and wax.
You might want to bring a hairbrush or comb with you, as your hair may be a bit messy when the test is finished. Some people bring a hat to cover their hair until they can wash it at home afterwards."
How an EEG is carried out,"There are several different ways an EEG recording can be taken. The clinical neurophysiologist will explain the procedure to you and can answer any questions you have. 
You'll also be asked whether you consent to treatment for the various parts of the test to be carried out. This may include video consent for some EEGs.
Before the test starts, your scalp will be cleaned and about 20 small sensors called electrodes will be attached using a special glue or paste. These are connected by wires to an EEG recording machine.
Sensors called electrodes are attached to the head (usually with glue or paste) and connect to an EEG recording machine. You’ll sit or lie down for an EEG.
Credit:
Routine EEG recordings usually take 20 to 40 minutes, although a typical appointment will last about an hour, including some preparation time at the beginning and some time at the end.
Other types of EEG recording may take longer."
Types of EEG,"Routine EEG
A routine EEG recording lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes.
During the test, you'll be asked to rest quietly. You will usually be asked to open or close your eyes from time to time. In most cases, you'll also be asked to breathe in and out deeply (called hyperventilation) for a few minutes.
A flashing light may also be used to see if this affects your brain activity.
Sleep EEG or sleep-deprived EEG
A sleep EEG is carried out while you're asleep. It may be used if a routine EEG does not give enough information, or to test for sleep disorders.
In some cases, you may be asked to stay awake the night before the test to help ensure you can sleep while it's carried out. This is called a sleep-deprived EEG.
Ambulatory EEG
An ambulatory EEG is where brain activity is recorded throughout the day and night over a period of one or more days. The electrodes will be attached to a small portable EEG recorder that can be clipped onto your clothing.
You can continue with most of your normal daily activities while the recording is being taken, although you'll need to avoid getting the equipment wet.
Video telemetry
Video telemetry, also called video EEG, is a special type of EEG where you're filmed while an EEG recording is taken. This can help provide more information about your brain activity.
The test is usually carried out over a few days while staying in a purpose-built hospital suite.
The EEG signals are transmitted wirelessly to a computer. The video is also recorded by the computer and kept under regular surveillance by trained staff.
Invasive EEG-telemetry
This EEG is not common, but it may be used to check if surgery is possible for some people with more complex epilepsy.
It involves surgery to place electrodes directly on the brain to find out exactly where the seizures are coming from."
What happens after an EEG,"When the test is finished, the electrodes will be removed and your scalp will be cleaned. Your hair will probably still be a bit sticky and messy afterwards, so you may want to wash it when you get home.
You can usually go home soon after the test is finished and return to your normal activities. You might feel tired after the test, particularly if you had a sleep or sleep-deprived EEG, so you may want someone to pick you up from hospital.
You normally will not get your results on the same day. The recordings will need to be analysed first and will be sent to the doctor who requested the test. They can discuss the results with you a few days or weeks later."
Are there any risks or side effects?,"The EEG procedure is painless, comfortable and generally very safe. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. Apart from having messy hair and possibly feeling a bit tired, you normally will not experience any side effects.
However, you may feel lightheaded and notice a tingling in your lips and fingers for a few minutes during the hyperventilation part of the test. Some people develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached.
If you have epilepsy, there's a very small risk you could have a seizure while the test is carried out, but you'll be closely monitored and help will be on hand in case this happens."
Types of emollients,"Lotions
Lotions are good for hairy or damaged areas of skin (such as weeping eczema – where pus is seeping out of damaged areas of skin). This is because lotions are thin and spread easily, but they're not very moisturising.
Sprays
Sprays are good for hard-to-reach areas and sore or infected skin that should not be touched, and are absorbed quickly.
Creams
Creams are good for daytime use as they're not very greasy and are absorbed quickly.
Ointments
Ointments are good for very dry, thickened skin and night-time use as they're greasy, thick and very moisturising. Ointments are usually free of preservatives so are suitable for sensitive skin, but should not be used on weeping eczema.
Leave-on products
There are lots of different types of leave-on emollient that can be put directly on the skin.
Some create a protective barrier over the skin to lock in moisture. Some have added ingredients to reduce itching or prevent infection.
Your doctor or pharmacist will talk to you about which type of emollient will work best for your skin condition.
You may have to try a few different emollients to find the best one for your or your child's skin.
Many of these leave-on products can also be used to wash with.
Soap substitutes
Everyday soaps, shampoos and shower gels usually dry out the skin and can make skin conditions like eczema worse.
It's recommended to use leave-on emollients as a soap substitute if you have dry or itchy skin.
Emollient soap substitutes that are used instead of normal soap in the bath or shower are not usually available on the NHS."
How to get emollients,"You can buy emollients from a pharmacy without a prescription. If the skin condition is severe, talk to a GP, nurse or health visitor, as you may need a stronger treatment.
If you or your children need to use an emollient regularly, it's a good idea to keep some in small pots or tubes at home, school or work.
How to use emollients
How to use emollients on your skin
Emollient lotions, sprays, creams and ointments should be applied directly to the skin.
They should be smoothed, not rubbed, into the skin gently in the same direction that your hair grows. This helps prevent hair follicles getting blocked.
They can be used to replace lost moisture whenever your skin feels dry or tight. They're very safe and you cannot overuse them.
You may need to experiment with different emollients or try a combination. For example, you may decide to use a cream during the day and an ointment at night.
How to wash with emollients
Mix a small amount (around teaspoonful) of leave-on emollient or soap substitute in the palm of your hand with a little warm water and spread it over damp or dry skin.
Rinse and pat the skin dry, being careful not to rub it.
You can use leave-on emollients or soap substitutes for handwashing, showering or in the bath.
They do not foam like normal soap, but are just as effective at cleaning the skin.
If your skin stings after using an emollient wash product and does not settle after rinsing, ask a pharmacist to recommend a different product.
Using emollients with other skin treatments
If you're using a steroid cream or another treatment for your skin condition, wait 20 to 30 minutes between using an emollient and using the other treatment. Ask a doctor which one to use first.
This avoids diluting the effect of the treatment and spreading it to areas of skin that do not need it."
When to apply emollients,"Emollients can be applied as often as you like to keep the skin well moisturised and in good condition. Ideally, this should be done at least 3 or 4 times a day.
It's especially important to regularly apply an emollient to your hands and face, as they're exposed to the elements more than any other part of your body.
Certain activities, such as gardening, can irritate the skin. It may help to apply an emollient before doing these.
It may help to apply an emollient before and after swimming. Leave enough time for it to be absorbed into your skin before you swim.
It's a good idea to protect babies' hands and cheeks with an emollient before mealtimes to stop them getting sore from food and drink.
Emollients are best applied after washing your hands, taking a bath or showering because this is when the skin most needs moisture.
The emollient should be applied as soon as you have patted your skin dry to make sure it's properly absorbed."
Skin reactions,"Emollients can sometimes cause a skin reaction, such as:
an overheating, burning sensation or stinging that does not settle after a few days of treatment – usually caused by a reaction to a certain ingredient in the emollient
blocked or inflamed hair follicles (folliculitis) that may cause boils
rashes on the face that can aggravate acne
If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to a GP, nurse or pharmacist."
Safety advice when using emollients,"Fire safety
Keep away from fire, flames and cigarettes when using all types of emollients (both paraffin-based and paraffin-free). Dressings, clothing and bedding that have been in contact with an emollient can easily catch fire. Washing fabrics at high temperatures may reduce the build-up of an emollient, but does not remove it completely.
Risk of infections
Use a clean spoon or spatula to remove emollients from a pot or tub. This reduces the risk of infections from contaminated pots.
Risk of slipping
Be careful not to slip when using emollients in a bath or shower, or on a tiled floor. Protect the floor with a non-slip mat, towel or sheet. Wear protective gloves, wash your bath or shower afterwards with hot water and washing-up liquid, then dry with a kitchen towel.
Skin irritation from aqueous cream
Aqueous cream is no longer recommended as an emollient. It contains an ingredient called sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) which can cause skin irritation such as burning, stinging, itching and redness. Some people still find it helpful as a soap substitute."
What causes empyema?,"The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura.
These layers are almost in contact, but separated by a thin space (the pleural space) filled with a small amount of lubricant called pleural fluid.
The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected, and a collection of pus forms.
This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together, creating pockets of pus.
Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus, with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs.
These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly.
Pneumonia and other possible causes
The most common cause of empyema is pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs.
An empyema can form when pneumonia fails to fully respond to treatment in a straightforward way.
Other possible causes are:
bronchiectasis – a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection
a blood clot or another blockage – this can prevent blood flow to the lungs, causing some of the lung tissue to die (known as a pulmonary infarction)
surgery to the chest – empyema is a rare complication
an endoscopy – empyema is a rare complication
serious injury to the chest
an infection elsewhere in the body that's spread through the bloodstream
an infection caused by inhaled food if you have swallowing problems – this is rare
tuberculosis – this is rare in the UK
You're more at risk of developing an empyema if you:
have diabetes
have a weakened immune system
have acid reflux
drink too much alcohol or take a lot of recreational drugs
Both adults and children can be affected."
What are the symptoms?,"An empyema can be distressing and uncomfortable.
It can cause:
a fever and night sweats
a lack of energy
difficulty breathing
weight loss
chest pain
a cough and coughing up mucus containing pus"
How is it diagnosed?,"An empyema is usually suspected when a person with severe pneumonia doesn't improve with treatment and they start to show some of the symptoms of empyema .
If the patient is coughing up mucus, a sample of this should be taken to be inspected under a microscope. 
The type of bacteria causing the infection is identified so the most effective antibiotics can be given.
A blood sample will also be taken to count the number of white blood cells and other markers of infection.
An X-ray or ultrasound scan will show whether there's a collection of fluid building up around the lungs and how much there is. If there is fluid a sample will be taken and sent for analysis.
Often a CT scan may also be used to give a more detailed assessment."
How is it treated?,"Antibiotics
Some patients will just need antibiotics given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously).
But they may need to stay in hospital for a long period.
Chest drain
Some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain.
A chest drain is a flexible plastic tube that's inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area to drain it of fluid.
The area where the tube is inserted is numbed, and the patient may also be given a light sedative before having the drain inserted.
Painkillers are given to ease any pain while the chest drain is in.
The chest tube usually stays in place until an X-ray or ultrasound scan shows all the fluid has drained from the chest and the lungs are fully expanded.
Sometimes injections may be given through the chest drain to help clear the infected pockets of pus.
The patient may need to stay in hospital until the tube is removed.
Some patients may be able to go home with the chest tube still in place, in which case a specialist nurse will offer support and advice on how to manage this at home.
The nurse will demonstrate how to position, empty and change the bag until the family or patient feels confident they can do this themselves.
For more information, read this NHS factsheet on chest drains (PDF, 60kb).
Surgery to remove the lung lining
Surgery may be needed if the condition doesn't improve. 
This involves making a cut in the chest to access the lungs and removing the thick layer coating the lungs so they can expand properly again.
This is only carried out if other treatments haven't worked.
Your surgeon or specialist will explain the benefits and risks of the procedure.
Find out more about lung surgery
Stoma
A chest drain isn't suitable for all patients. Some will instead opt to have an opening made in their chest, known as a stoma. 
A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema.
This is worn on the body, and may be more discreet and interfere less with your lifestyle than a chest drain.
But with modern treatments, getting a stoma is uncommon."
Symptoms of encephalitis,"Encephalitis usually starts off with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and headache.
More serious symptoms come on over hours, days or weeks, including:
confusion or disorientation
seizures or fits
changes in personality and behaviour
difficulty speaking
weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body
loss of consciousness
Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has these serious symptoms."
Causes of encephalitis,"It's not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by:
viral infections – very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by the common viruses that causes cold sores (herpes simplex) or chickenpox (herpes varicella) spreading to the brain
a problem with the immune system, the body's defence against infection – sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamed
bacterial or fungal infections – these are much rarer causes of encephalitis than viral infections
Some types of encephalitis are spread by mosquitoes (such as Japanese encephalitis), ticks (such as tick-borne encephalitis) and mammals (such as rabies).
You cannot catch encephalitis from someone else."
Treatments for encephalitis,"Encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include:
antiviral medicines
steroid injections
treatments to help control the immune system
antibiotics or antifungal medicines
painkillers to reduce discomfort or a high temperature
medicine to control seizures or fits
support with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator)
How long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months."
Recovering from encephalitis,"Some people eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process.
Many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems caused by damage to their brain.
Common complications include:
memory loss (amnesia)
frequent seizures or fits
personality and behavioural changes
problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving
persistent tiredness
These problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends.
But help and support is available."
Preventing encephalitis,"It's not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations.
These include the:
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine – a routine vaccination offered to all children in England
Japanese encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas, such as parts of Asia
tick-borne encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to certain parts of Europe (but not the UK) and Asia
rabies vaccination – recommended for travellers to at-risk where access to medical care is likely to be limited. Find out about rabies risks in terrestrial animals by country on GOV.UK.
Speak to a GP surgery if you're not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you're planning to travel abroad and do not know if you need any vaccinations."
Symptoms of endocarditis,"The initial symptoms of endocarditis are similar to flu and include:
a high temperature
chills
headache
joint and muscle pain
Without treatment, the infection damages the heart valves and disrupts the normal flow of blood through the heart.
This could trigger a range of life-threatening complications, such as:
heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body to properly meet the body's demands
stroke – where the supply of blood to the brain becomes disrupted
Find out more about the symptoms of endocarditis"
Treating endocarditis,"Endocarditis is treated with a course of antibiotics given via a drip. You'll need to be admitted to hospital for this.
Some people also need surgery to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or drain any abscesses that develop.
Endocarditis is a serious illness, especially if complications develop. Early diagnosis and treatment is vital to improve the outlook for the condition.
Find out more about the treatment of endocarditis"
Who's affected,"Endocarditis is a rare condition in England, even in those with a higher risk.
It's more common in older people.
But cases of endocarditis have been recorded in children, particularly those born with congenital heart disease.
Twice as many men are affected as women.
Although it may sound strange, rates of endocarditis are increasing because of advances in medical care.
This is because there's an increasing number of people being treated with valve replacement surgery or surgery to repair congenital heart disease."
Symptoms of endometriosis,"The symptoms of endometriosis can vary. Some women are badly affected, while others might not have any noticeable symptoms.
Some common symptoms of endometriosis are:
pain in your lower tummy or back (pelvic pain) – usually worse during your period
period pain that stops you doing your normal activities
pain during or after sex
pain when peeing or pooing during your period
feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your pee or poo during your period
difficulty getting pregnant
You may also have heavy periods. You might use lots of pads or tampons, or you may bleed through to your clothes.
For some women, endometriosis can have a big impact on their life and may sometimes lead to depression."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have symptoms of endometriosis, especially if they're having a big impact on your life.
It may help to write down your symptoms before seeing a doctor.
Endometriosis UK has a pain and symptoms diary (PDF, 238kb) you can use.
It can be difficult to diagnose endometriosis because the symptoms can vary considerably, and many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.
A GP will ask about your symptoms and may ask to examine your tummy and vagina.
They may recommend treatments if they think you have endometriosis.
If these do not help, they might refer you to a specialist called a gynaecologist for some further tests, such as an ultrasound scan, MRI or laparoscopy.
A laparoscopy is where a surgeon passes a thin tube through a small cut in your tummy so they can see any patches of endometriosis tissue.
This is the only way to be certain you have endometriosis."
Treatments for endometriosis,"There's currently no cure for endometriosis, but there are treatments that can help ease the symptoms.
Treatments include:
painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol
hormone medicines and contraceptives, including the combined pill, contraceptive patch, intrauterine system (IUS) and contraceptive implant, and medicines called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues
surgery to cut away patches of endometriosis tissue
surgery to remove part or all of the organs affected by endometriosis, such as surgery to remove part of your colon, or your appendix or womb (hysterectomy)
Your doctor will discuss the options with you. Sometimes they may suggest not starting treatment immediately, to see if your symptoms improve on their own."
Further problems caused by endometriosis,"One of the main complications of endometriosis is difficulty getting pregnant or not being able to get pregnant at all (infertility).
Surgery to remove endometriosis tissue can help improve your chances of getting pregnant, although there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get pregnant after treatment.
Surgery for endometriosis can also sometimes cause further problems, such as infections, bleeding or damage to affected organs.
If surgery is recommended for you, talk to your surgeon about the possible risks.
Find out more about the complications of endometriosis"
Living with endometriosis,"Endometriosis can be a difficult condition to deal with, both physically and emotionally.
As well as support from your doctor, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as Endometriosis UK, for information and advice.
In addition to detailed information about endometriosis, Endometriosis UK has a directory of local support groups, a helpline on 0808 808 2227, webchat, and an online community on HealthUnlocked for women affected by the condition."
Causes of endometriosis,"The cause of endometriosis is not known.
Several theories have been suggested, including:
genetics – the condition tends to run in families and affects people of certain ethnic groups more than others
a problem with the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection
endometrium cells spreading through the body in the bloodstream or lymphatic system, a series of tubes and glands that form part of the immune system
But none of these theories fully explain why endometriosis happens.
It's likely the condition is caused by a combination of different factors."
Types of endoscopy,"Find out about:
colonoscopy: in your bottom to check your bowels
colposcopy: in your vagina to check your cervix (the opening to your womb)
cystoscopy: in your urethra (tube where pee comes out) to check your bladder
gastroscopy: in your mouth to check your oesophagus (food pipe), stomach and part of the small intestine
hysteroscopy: in your vagina to check your womb"
Who can benefit from enhanced recovery?,"Some of the principles of enhanced recovery can be applied to all cases of surgery. However, for some conditions and procedures, specially designed pathways help patients benefit from the principles more effectively.
Types of surgery and conditions where enhanced recovery programmes are currently used include:
breast – such as removal of a breast because of breast cancer
bowel – such as removal of part or all of the bowel or back passage because of bowel cancer
gynaecological – such as removal of the womb (hysterectomy)
musculoskeletal – such as a hip replacement or knee replacement
urological – such as removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) because of prostate cancer
Some hospitals also offer enhanced recovery programmes following heart or chest surgery."
The enhanced recovery programme,"If you need to have an operation, ask whether there's an enhanced recovery programme in place for your condition at the hospital you're going to.
To enhance your recovery from surgery, it's important that you play an active role in your own care.
Important points to consider before your operation include:
eating well – your body will need energy for repair
exercise – being physically active before your operation will help you recover quicker
relaxation – try to relax and not worry about your operation
smoking and alcohol – giving up or cutting down will help speed up your recovery and reduce your risk of developing complications
Your GP will give you advice about getting into the best possible shape before having surgery. They'll also identify and try to stabilise any health conditions you have that may affect the operation.
At this stage, your GP should ensure you understand all the treatment options available to you so you can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with surgery.
In hospital, your healthcare team will advise you about what you can do to help make your recovery easier.
This may include:
staying active – you may even be walked to the operating theatre
drinking clear fluids or carbohydrated drinks up to 2 hours before your operation
becoming as active as soon as possible after your surgery
eating a healthy diet after your surgery
keeping an enhanced recovery diary to track your progress
Where possible, techniques that will help with your recovery may also be recommended, such as using minimally invasive surgery (keyhole surgery), local or regional anaesthesia, and minimal use of drains and nasogastric tubes.
After surgery, you'll also have access to rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy. This will help speed up your recovery and enable you to be discharged from hospital as soon as possible.
Depending on your operation, you may be able to go home sooner than usually expected. It's therefore important to plan and prepare for your return home before going into hospital.
Read more about having an operation."
Further information,"Speak to a GP if you're considering having planned surgery. They'll advise you about whether enhanced recovery is suitable for you.
Not all hospitals offer enhanced recovery programmes, but the number that do is growing all the time."
Symptoms of epidermolysis bullosa,"Common symptoms in all types of EB include:
skin that blisters easily
blisters on the hands and soles of the feet
thickened skin that may be scarred or change colour over time
thickening of the skin and nails
Credit:
Credit:"
Types of epidermolysis bullosa,"The 3 main types of EB are:
epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) – the most common type, which can range from mild, with a low risk of serious complications, to severe
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) – which can range from mild to severe
junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) – a rare form of EB that ranges from moderate to severe
The type reflects where on the body the blistering takes place and which layer of skin is affected.
There are also many variants of these 3 main types of EB, each with slightly different symptoms.
Read more about symptoms of different types of epidermolysis bullosa."
Diagnosing EB,"EB is usually diagnosed in babies and young children, as the symptoms can be obvious from birth. But some milder types of EB may not be diagnosed until adulthood.
If it's suspected your child has the condition, they'll be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist).
The specialist will carry out tests to determine the type of EB and help come up with a treatment plan. They may take a small sample of skin (biopsy) to send for testing.
Prenatal testing
In some cases it's possible to test an unborn baby for EB after the 11th week of pregnancy.
Prenatal tests include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling.
This may be offered if you or your partner are known to be a carrier of the faulty gene associated with EB and there's a risk of having a child with a severe type of EB.
If the test confirms your child will have EB, you'll be offered counselling and advice."
Causes of epidermolysis bullosa,"EB is caused by a faulty gene (gene mutation) that makes skin more fragile.
A child with EB might have inherited the faulty gene from a parent who also has EB. Or they might have inherited the faulty gene from both parents who are just ""carriers"" but don't have EB themselves.
The change to the gene can also happen by chance, when neither parent are carriers."
Treatment for epidermolysis bullosa,"There's currently no cure for EB, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing, such as infection.
A team of medical specialists will help you decide what treatment is best for your child and offer advice about living with the condition.
Managing EB can include:
popping blisters with a sterile needle
applying protective dressings
avoiding things that make the condition worse
Medicines can be used to treat infection or to reduce pain. Surgery may be needed if EB causes narrowing of the food pipe or problems with the hands.
Read more about treating epidermolysis bullosa."
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita,"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an acquired form of EB with similar symptoms.
Like EB, EBA causes the skin to blister easily. It can also affect the mouth, throat and digestive tract.
But EBA isn't inherited, and symptoms don't usually appear until later life.
It's an autoimmune disease, which means your immune system starts to attack healthy body tissue. It's not known exactly what causes this.
EBA is a very rare condition that tends to affect people over the age of 40."
Charities and support groups,"If your child is diagnosed with EB, it can be a frightening and overwhelming experience. You'll probably want to find out as much as possible about the condition and available treatments.
DEBRA is a national charity that provides help, advice and support for people in the UK living with or directly affected by EB.
DEBRA International is a worldwide network of national groups working on behalf of people affected by EB.
Cure EB is a charity that funds research into treatments and a cure for Epidermolysis Bullosa.
Support for carers
It's important not to neglect your own health and wellbeing when caring for a child with a complex and demanding condition such as EB.
Read about carers' breaks and respite care and caring for a disabled child."
Information about you,"If you or your child has EB, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register (GOV.UK)"
Check if it's epididymitis,"Symptoms of epididymitis may include:
sudden or gradual pain in 1 or both of your testicles (balls)
the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) feeling tender, warm and swollen
a build-up of fluid around your testicle (a hydrocele) that feels like a lump or swelling
You may have other symptoms depending on the cause, such as difficulty peeing, or a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis."
Causes of epididymitis,"Epididymitis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea. This is more likely in younger men under 35 years old.
If testing shows that your epididymitis is caused by a STI, it may be recommended that your current or recent sexual partners are also tested for STIs.
It can also be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), but UTIs are less common in men.
A UTI is more likely if you have:
an enlarged prostate gland
a urinary catheter
recently had surgery to the groin, prostate gland or bladder
Sometimes a cause cannot be found."
Treatments for epididymitis,"If you have an infection, you'll usually be given antibiotics. Depending on the cause of the infection, you may be given antibiotic injections or tablets, or a combination of both.
It's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.
You should start to feel better within a few days, but it may take up to 3 months to fully recover. If you still have symptoms after this, you might be referred for further tests.
There are some things you can do while you recover to help ease pain and swelling and prevent any further problems.
Do
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help with the pain – if you have a history of fits, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen should not be taken with some antibiotics used to treat epididymitis; speak to a pharmacist about the best painkiller to use if you're unsure
hold a cold pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on your groin
wear underwear that supports your scrotum
Don’t
do not have sex if you have gonorrhoea or chlamydia until you have finished the full course of treatment"
When epidurals are used,"Epidurals can be used:
during labour and childbirth, including caesareans
during some types of surgery
after some types of surgery
Steroid medicine can also be given with an epidural injection, to treat pain in your back or leg that's caused by sciatica, or a slipped (prolapsed) disc."
Preparing for an epidural,"If you have any concerns or questions about having an epidural, discuss these with your doctor. Let them know about any medicines you're taking.
You may be given specific advice about eating, drinking and medicines before the epidural.
You will not be able to drive for 24 hours after having an epidural, so you'll need to arrange for someone to take you home."
How an epidural is given,"Epidurals are given by a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist.
You're usually awake during an epidural, but for some types of surgery you may have it while under general anaesthetic.
A drip will be placed in your arm so you can be given fluids while you're having the epidural.
You'll be asked to sit down and lean forwards, or lie on your side with your knees up close your chest.
You'll be given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the skin where the epidural will be inserted.
A needle is used to insert a fine plastic tube called an epidural catheter into your back (spine) near the nerves that carry pain messages to your brain.
The needle is then removed, leaving just the catheter in your spine.
You may feel mild discomfort when the epidural needle is positioned and the catheter is inserted.
The epidural can be inserted at different levels of your spine, depending on the area of your body that needs pain relief.
Pain relief medicines are then given through the catheter. These take about 20 to 30 minutes to take full effect.
Your chest, tummy and legs may feel numb while the epidural medicines are being used, and your legs may not feel as strong as usual.
While the catheter remains in your back, it can be used to top up your pain relief medicines manually or using an automatic pump.
This can be for several hours (during childbirth) or for a few days (after major surgery).
Mobile epidurals, which use a lower dose of pain relief medicines, are sometimes used in childbirth, allowing you to walk around during labour."
Recovering from an epidural,"When the epidural is stopped, the numbness usually lasts for a few hours before its effects begin to wear off.
While the medicine wears off, you'll probably be advised to rest in a lying or sitting position until the feeling in your legs returns.
This can take a couple of hours, and you may feel a slight tingling sensation in your skin.
Tell the doctor or nurse if you feel any pain. They can give you medicines to help control it.
Do not drive, operate machinery or drink alcohol for 24 hours after having an epidural."
Risks and side effects of an epidural,"Epidurals are usually safe, but there's a small risk of side effects and complications, including:
low blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded or nauseous
temporary loss of bladder control
itchy skin
feeling sick
headaches
nerve damage
Read more about the side effects and complications of an epidural"
Symptoms of epiglottitis,"The symptoms of epiglottitis usually develop quickly and get rapidly worse, although they can develop over a few days in older children and adults.
Symptoms include:
a severe sore throat
difficulty and pain when swallowing
difficulty breathing, which may improve when leaning forwards
breathing that sounds abnormal and high-pitched (stridor)
a high temperature
irritability and restlessness
muffled or hoarse voice
drooling
The main symptoms of epiglottitis in young children are breathing difficulties, stridor and a hoarse voice.
In adults and older children, swallowing difficulties and drooling are the main symptoms."
When to get medical advice,"Epiglottitis is regarded as a medical emergency, as a swollen epiglottis can restrict the oxygen supply to your lungs.
Call 999 for an ambulance if you think you or your child has epiglottitis.
While waiting for an ambulance, you should not attempt to examine your child's throat, place anything inside their mouth, or lay them on their back. This may make their symptoms worse.
It's important to keep them calm and to try not to cause panic or distress.
Epiglottitis can be fatal if the throat becomes completely blocked. But most people make a full recovery with appropriate treatment."
Treating epiglottitis,"Epiglottitis is treated in hospital. The first thing the medical team will do is secure the person's airways to make sure they can breathe properly.
Securing the airways
An oxygen mask will be given to deliver highly concentrated oxygen to the person's lungs.
If this does not work, a tube will be placed in the person's mouth and pushed past their epiglottis into the windpipe. The tube will be connected to an oxygen supply.
If there's an urgent need to secure the airways, a small cut may be made in the neck at the front of the windpipe so a tube can be inserted. The tube is then connected to an oxygen supply.
This procedure is called a tracheostomy and it allows oxygen to enter the lungs while bypassing the epiglottis.
An emergency tracheostomy can be carried out using local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.
Once the airways have been secured and the person is able to breathe unrestricted, a more comfortable and convenient way of assisting breathing may be found.
This is usually achieved by threading a tube through the nose and into the windpipe.
Fluids will be supplied through a drip into a vein until the person is able to swallow.
Once this has been achieved and the situation is thought to be safe, some tests may be carried out, such as:
a fibreoptic laryngoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera attached to one end (laryngoscope) is used to examine the throat
a throat swab – to test for any bacteria or viruses
blood tests – to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood
an X-ray or a CT scan – sometimes used to check the level of swelling
Any underlying infection will be treated with a course of antibiotics.
With prompt treatment, most people recover from epiglottitis after about a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 7 days."
Why it happens,"Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria.
As well as epiglottitis, Hib can cause a number of serious infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis.
It spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus. The bacteria are in the tiny droplets of saliva and mucus propelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You catch the infection by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have landed on a surface or object, by touching this surface and then touching your face or mouth.
Less common causes of epiglottitis include:
other bacterial infections – such as streptococcus pneumoniae (a common cause of pneumonia)
fungal infections – people with a weakened immune system are most at risk from these types of infection
viral infections – such as the varicella zoster virus (the virus responsible for chickenpox) and the herpes simplex virus (the virus responsible for cold sores)
trauma to the throat – such as a blow to the throat, or burning the throat by drinking very hot liquids
smoking – particularly illegal drugs, such as cannabis or crack cocaine"
Hib vaccination,"The most effective way to prevent your child getting epiglottitis is to make sure their vaccinations are up-to-date.
Children are particularly vulnerable to a Hib infection because they have an underdeveloped immune system.
Babies should be vaccinated against Hib as part of the 6-in-1 DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria, hepatitis B, tetanus, whooping cough and polio.
They should receive 3 doses of the vaccine: at 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks of age. This is followed by an additional Hib/Men C ""booster"" vaccine at 1 year of age.
Contact your GP if you're not sure whether your child's vaccinations are up-to-date.
Read more about the NHS vaccination schedule."
Who's affected,"Because of the success of the Hib vaccination programme, epiglottitis is rare in the UK, and most cases now affect adults.
Deaths from epiglottitis are also rare, occurring in less than 1 in 100 cases."
Symptoms of epilepsy,"Seizures can affect people in different ways, depending on which part of the brain is involved.
Possible symptoms include:
uncontrollable jerking and shaking, called a ""fit""
losing awareness and staring blankly into space
becoming stiff
strange sensations, such as a ""rising"" feeling in the tummy, unusual smells or tastes, and a tingling feeling in your arms or legs
collapsing
Sometimes you might pass out and not remember what happened."
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you think you might have had a seizure for the first time.
This does not mean you have epilepsy, as a seizure can have several causes and sometimes they're just a one-off, but you should see a doctor to find out why it happened.

is having a seizure for the first time
has a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes
has lots of seizures in a row
has breathing problems or has seriously injured themselves
Find out what to do if someone has a seizure"
Treatments for epilepsy,"Treatment can help most people with epilepsy have fewer seizures or stop having seizures completely.
Treatments include:
medicines called anti-epileptic drugs – these are the main treatment
surgery to remove a small part of the brain that's causing the seizures
a procedure to put a small electrical device inside the body that can help control seizures
a special diet (ketogenic diet) that can help control seizures
Some people need treatment for life. But you might be able to stop treatment if your seizures disappear over time."
Living with epilepsy,"Epilepsy is usually a lifelong condition, but most people with it are able to have normal lives if their seizures are well controlled.
Most children with epilepsy are able to go to a mainstream school, take part in most activities and sports, and get a job when they're older.
But you may have to think about your epilepsy before you do things such as driving, certain jobs, swimming, using contraception and planning a pregnancy.
Advice is available from a GP or support groups to help you adjust to life with epilepsy.
Find out more about living with epilepsy"
Causes of epilepsy,"In epilepsy, the electrical signals in the brain become scrambled and there are sometimes sudden bursts of electrical activity. This is what causes seizures.
In most cases, it's not clear why this happens. It's possible it could be partly caused by your genes affecting how your brain works, as around 1 in 3 people with epilepsy have a family member with it.
Occasionally, epilepsy can be caused by damage to the brain, such as damage from:
a stroke
a brain tumour
a severe head injury
drug abuse or alcohol misuse
a brain infection
a lack of oxygen during birth"
What is erectile dysfunction?,"Erectile dysfunction is when you are either:
unable to get an erection
unable to keep an erection for long enough to have sex
Depending on the cause, you may still be able to get an erection at other times, such as when you wake up.
Sometimes you might also have low sex drive (loss of libido)."
Causes of erectile dysfunction,"Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection.
This is usually caused by stress, tiredness or drinking too much alcohol, and it's nothing to worry about.
It can also be a side effect of some medicines.
If erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as:
high blood pressure or high cholesterol
diabetes
depression or anxiety
hormone problems"
Things you can do to help with erectile dysfunction,"Healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction.
Do
lose weight if you're overweight
stop smoking
eat a healthy diet
exercise daily
try to reduce stress and anxiety
Don’t
do not drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week
do not cycle for a while, if you cycle for more than 3 hours a week"
What happens at your appointment,"If you see someone about erectile dysfunction, the doctor or nurse may:
ask about your lifestyle and relationships, and any problems you might be having
do some basic health checks, such as taking your blood pressure
examine your genitals to rule out any obvious physical cause
If you have symptoms like needing to pee more often than usual, you may also have an examination of your prostate (rectal examination)."
Treatments for erectile dysfunction,"Treatment can usually help improve erectile dysfunction.
Medicines for erectile dysfunction
The main treatments are medicines that increase the blood flow to your penis, called PDE-5 inhibitors.
These include:
sildenafil (Viagra)
tadalafil (Cialis)
vardenafil (Levitra)
avanafil (Spedra)
You can get sildenafil on prescription or you can buy it from a pharmacy. You need a prescription for the other types.
Buying Viagra online
Vacuum pumps
Vacuum pumps encourage blood to flow to the penis, causing an erection.
They work for most men and can be used if medicine is not suitable or does not work.
They're not always available on the NHS. Speak to a doctor about where to get a vacuum pump.
Treating the cause of erectile dysfunction
There are also treatments for some of the causes of erectile dysfunction.
For example:
your doctor may switch you to a different medicine if it's causing your erectile dysfunction
high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hormone problems may be treated with medicine
counselling and therapy can help if your erection problems are linked to emotional or mental health problems – but there can be a long wait for these services on the NHS"
Check if it's erythema multiforme,"The main symptom of erythema multiforme is a rash.
The rash usually appears on your hands and feet, and spreads to your tummy, chest, back or face. It might feel itchy or like it's burning.
Credit:
The rash usually starts as round, slightly raised spots. Some spots develop rings around them and can turn into blisters.
Credit:
Depending on your skin tone, the rash may be red, pink or purple, or it may be darker than surrounding skin.
Credit:
Sometimes you can get the rash inside your mouth or on your lips, eyes, anus or genitals. This can be painful.
Other symptoms
You may also have other symptoms such as:
a high temperature
headache
body aches and pains
feeling generally unwell"
Treatment for erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme usually gets better on its own in 2 to 4 weeks.
Sometimes, you may need:
moisturisers or steroid creams to speed up recovery and help ease symptoms like itching
treatment for the infection that's causing it, such as antiviral medicine for a virus"
Causes of erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme is usually caused by an infection, such as the herpes simplex virus (which also causes cold sores) or a bacteria that causes lung conditions like pneumonia.
It can sometimes be caused by some vaccines or medicines such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, statins and medicines for epilepsy.
If it's caused by a medicine, you usually need to stop taking it. But do not stop taking any medicines without talking to a doctor first."
Check if you have erythema nodosum,"If you have erythema nodosum, you may have flu-like symptoms before or at the same time as you get the patches on your skin.
For example, you may:
have a high temperature
have swollen, aching joints, particularly the knees, ankles and wrists
feel generally unwell
Large areas of skin are often red and tender or painful.
Credit:
Erythema nodosum commonly affects the lower legs, but you can get it in other areas, such as on the arms, thighs and neck.
Credit:
The affected patches of skin may heal and fade to leave marks that look like bruises.
Credit:
The skin usually heals on its own within 3 to 8 weeks without leaving a scar. But other symptoms, such as joint pain and swelling, can last for several weeks."
Things you can do to ease the pain of erythema nodosum,"There are some things you can do to help ease the pain of erythema nodosum.
Do
try taking ibuprofen
rest with your feet raised on a pillow
try to avoid long periods of standing, walking and running
put a cool wet compress, like a damp cloth, on the affected area
A pharmacist can help with erythema nodosum
If you're in pain, a pharmacist can recommend:
stronger painkillers
supportive bandages or stockings
They may also suggest you see a GP.
Find a pharmacy"
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP may be able to tell if you have erythema nodosum by looking at the inflamed areas of skin.
Tests may be needed to find the cause. This may include a biopsy, where a small sample of skin is taken so it can be looked at under a microscope."
Treatments for erythema nodosum,"Treatment for erythema nodosum depends on the cause.
If it's caused by another condition, treating that condition may help. For example, if it’s caused by an infection, you may be given antibiotics.
If the GP thinks a medicine you've been taking might be causing erythema nodosum, they may advise you to stop taking it. Do not stop taking medicines without asking a GP first.
If your symptoms have lasted a long time or they keep returning, other treatments, such as steroid tablets, may be recommended."
Causes of erythema nodosum,"Erythema nodosum can be caused by lots of things, but often the cause is unknown.
Common causes include:
inflammatory bowel conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
bacterial infections, such a throat infection, chest infection or lung infection (tuberculosis)
a rare condition where small patches of swollen tissue develop in organs, such as the lungs, lymph nodes or skin (sarcoidosis)
a reaction to some medicines, including the contraceptive pill and some antibiotics"
Symptoms of erythrocytosis,"Not everyone with erythrocytosis has symptoms – but many do.
Make an appointment to see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of erythrocytosis. These include:
headaches
blurred vision
red skin, particularly in the face, hands and feet – this may be more difficult to see on black or brown skin
tiredness
high blood pressure
dizziness
discomfort in the tummy
confusion
bleeding problems – such as nosebleeds and bruising
gout – which can cause joint pain, stiffness and swelling
itchy skin – especially after a bath or shower"
When to seek immediate medical advice,"Erythrocytosis can cause blood clots. These put you at risk of life-threatening problems such as:
pulmonary embolisms – a blockage in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blockage that forms in the blood vessels in your leg before moving elsewhere in your body
Seek medical help immediately if you or someone you're with shows signs of DVT or a pulmonary embolism. These include:
pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one of your legs
a heavy ache in the affected area
warm skin in the area of the clot
breathlessness
chest or upper back pain
coughing up blood
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
fainting
Erythrocytosis also increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Seek emergency medical help if you think that you or someone you're with is having a heart attack or stroke."
What causes erythrocytosis?,"Erythrocytosis can be divided into several different types, depending on the underlying cause. In some cases, an underlying cause can't be identified.
Apparent erythrocytosis
""Apparent erythrocytosis"" is where your red cell count is normal, but you have a reduced amount of a fluid called plasma in your blood, making it thicker.
Apparent erythrocytosis is often caused by being overweight, smoking, drinking too much alcohol or taking certain medicines – including diuretics (tablets for high blood pressure that make you pee more).
Apparent erythrocytosis may improve if the underlying cause is identified and managed. Stopping smoking or reducing your alcohol intake, for example, may help.
Relative polycythaemia
This is similar to apparent erythrocytosis. It can happen as a result of dehydration.
Absolute polycythaemia
""Absolute erythrocytosis"" is where your body produces too many red blood cells. There are 2 main types:
primary erythrocytosis – there's a problem in the cells produced by the bone marrow that become red blood cells; the most common type is known as polycythaemia vera
secondary erythrocytosis – too many red blood cells are produced as the result of an underlying condition
Primary erythrocytosis - polycythaemia vera
Polycythaemia vera is rare. It's usually caused by a change in the JAK2 gene, which causes the bone marrow cells to produce too many red blood cells. It’s a slow-growing type of blood cancer.
The affected bone marrow cells can also develop into other cells found in the blood, which means that people with polycythaemia vera may also have abnormally high numbers of both platelets and white bloods cells.
Although caused by a genetic change, polycythaemia vera isn't usually inherited. Most cases develop later in life. The average age at diagnosis is 60.
Secondary erythrocytosis
Secondary erythrocytosis is where an underlying condition causes more erythropoietin to be produced. This is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the bone marrow cells to produce red blood cells.
Health conditions that can cause secondary erythrocytosis include:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – this can cause an increase in erythropoietin, due to not enough oxygen reaching the body's tissues
a problem with the kidneys – such as a kidney cancer or narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys"
How erythrocytosis is diagnosed,"Erythrocytosis can be diagnosed by carrying out a blood test to check:
the number of red blood cells in your blood (red blood cell count)
the amount of space the red blood cells take up in the blood (haematocrit level)
A high concentration of red blood cells suggests you have erythrocytosis.
Erythrocytosis is sometimes only discovered during a routine blood test for another reason.
Your GP may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders) for more tests, to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause.
These may include:
a blood test to look for the changed JAK2 gene
an ultrasound scan of your tummy to look for problems in your kidneys"
Treatments for erythrocytosis,"Treatment for erythrocytosis aims to prevent symptoms and complications (such as blood clots), and treat any underlying causes.
Venesection (removing blood)
Venesection is the simplest and quickest way of reducing the number of red cells in your blood. It may be recommended if you have polycythaemia vera, a history of blood clots, or symptoms suggesting your blood is too thick.
Venesection involves removing about 1 pint (half a litre) of blood at a time, in a similar way to the procedure used for blood donation.
How often this is needed will be different for each person. At first, you may need the treatment every week, but once your erythrocytosis is under control you should need it less often.
If you are going to have a venesection, your hospital will give you more information about what is involved.
Medicine to reduce red blood cells
In cases of polycythaemia vera, medicine may be prescribed to slow down the production of red blood cells.
Many different medicines are available and your specialist will take into account your age and health, response to venesection and red blood cell count when choosing the most appropriate one for you. Examples include:
hydroxycarbamide – this medicine is taken as tablets every morning and is generally tolerated well. But you should not take it if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant
interferon – this medicine is given by injection into the abdomen or thigh 1 to 3 times a week. You can inject it yourself at home once you've become familiar with how to do it. Interferon has the advantage that it can be taken in pregnancy, but it may cause unpleasant side effects, such as hair loss and flu-like symptoms
Medicine to prevent blood clots
If you have polycythaemia vera, daily low-dose aspirin tablets may be prescribed to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of serious complications.
You may also be offered treatment with low-dose aspirin if you have apparent or secondary erythrocytosis and another health problem affecting your blood vessels, such as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease."
Treating and preventing other symptoms,"Some people may also need treatment for any other symptoms or complications of erythrocytosis they have, or for any underlying cause of the condition.
For example, you may be given medicine to help relieve itching or manage COPD. Read more about:
treatments for itching
treating COPD"
Lifestyle changes that help,"As well as improving some cases of apparent erythrocytosis, making healthy lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of potentially serious blood clots for people with all types of erythrocytosis.
Having erythrocytosis means you're already at high risk of a blood clot, and being overweight or smoking only increases this risk.
You may find the following advice and information helpful:

managing high blood pressure
stopping smoking"
Outlook for erythrocytosis,"The outlook for erythrocytosis largely depends on the underlying cause.
Many cases are mild and may not lead to any further complications. However, some cases – particularly cases of polycythaemia vera – can be more serious and require long-term treatment.
If well controlled, erythrocytosis should not affect your life expectancy, and you should be able to live a normal life. However, people with polycythaemia vera can have a slightly lower life expectancy than normal due to the increased risk of problems, such as heart attacks and strokes.
Polycythaemia vera can also sometimes cause scarring of the bone marrow (myelofibrosis), which can eventually lead to you having too few blood cells. In some rare cases, it can develop into a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)."
Check if it's erythromelalgia,"Erythromelalgia usually affects the feet, but can also happen in the hands, arms, legs, ears and face.
The main symptoms are:
burning pain, which often starts as itching
redness – this can look different on brown or black skin
warm or hot skin
Other symptoms include:
swelling
sweating more than normal
Credit:
The pain can either be constant or come and go. When the pain comes, it might be called a flare-up. A flare-up can come on gradually or suddenly, and last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.
Your skin may feel cold after a flare-up and look blue or grey."
What happens at your appointment,"If a GP thinks you may have erythromelalgia, they'll refer you to a specialist.
The specialist will examine you and ask about your symptoms.
They may do tests, including blood tests and tests to look for changes in your genes that may be causing your symptoms (genetic and genomic testing)."
Causes of erythromelalgia,"It's often not clear what causes erythromelalgia.
Sometimes it's caused by another condition or a faulty gene inherited from one of your parents.
A flare-up of your symptoms is triggered by an increase in your body temperature.
This can be caused by:
exercise
wearing warm or tight clothes and shoes
warm temperatures (such as during hot weather)
stress
drinking alcohol or eating spicy food
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration)"
Treatments for erythromelalgia,"How erythromelalgia is treated depends on the cause.
If you have another condition that's causing your symptoms, treating that condition can help.
Most treatment aims to prevent flare-ups. It can include medicines, creams, gels, sprays, tablets and medicines given into a vein.
Rarely, you may need surgery.
Erythromelalgia can be difficult to treat. You may need to try different combinations of treatments to find the ones that work for you."
Things that can help with erythromelalgia,"There are things you can try to help control erythromelalgia symptoms and avoid flare-ups.
Do
try to avoid things that trigger your symptoms
wear loose clothing and shoes
drink plenty of fluids
try to manage stress
cool down your hands or feet with a fan or cool (not cold) gel pack for a short period of time
raise your hands or feet on a chair or pillow when you can during a flare-up
Don’t
do not cool down your hands or feet with cold water or use ice, as this can damage your skin
do not drink alcohol or eat spicy food"
When a tremor is normal,"It's normal to have a slight tremor. For example, if you hold your hands or arms out in front of you, they will not be completely still.
Sometimes a tremor becomes more noticeable.
This often happens:
as you get older
when you're stressed, tired, anxious or angry
after drinking caffeine (for example, in tea, coffee or cola), drinking alcohol, or smoking
if you're very hot or cold
Some medicines and conditions can also cause a tremor. Speak to your GP before you stop taking any prescribed medicine."
What happens at your GP appointment,"To find out what might be causing your tremor, a GP may examine you and ask:
if you have any other symptoms
if you're taking any medicine
about your and your family's medical history – some types of tremor run in families
A mild tremor that's not caused by another condition does not usually need any treatment. The GP may want to monitor you to make sure it does not get any worse.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests if your tremor could be a symptom of a condition like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis."
Treating a severe tremor,"If you have a tremor that's affecting your life, your GP may prescribe medicine. Medicine will not cure the tremor, but it often helps to reduce the shaking or trembling.
You may need to take medicine all the time, or only when you need it – for example, before a stressful situation that causes your tremor to get worse.
If a tremor is affecting your head or voice, you may be offered injections to block the nerves and relax the muscles.
Rarely, brain surgery may be an option to treat a severe tremor that is not helped by medicine."
The law,"Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under English law.
Assisted suicide
Assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment. Trying to kill yourself is not a criminal act.
Euthanasia
Depending on the circumstances, euthanasia is regarded as either manslaughter or murder. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment."
Types of euthanasia,"Euthanasia can be classified as:
voluntary euthanasia – where a person makes a conscious decision to die and asks for help to do so
non-voluntary euthanasia – where a person is unable to give their consent (for example, because they're in a coma) and another person takes the decision on their behalf, perhaps because the ill person previously expressed a wish for their life to be ended in such circumstances"
End of life care,"When you're approaching the last stage of your life, you have a right to high quality, personalised end of life care that helps you live as well as possible until you die.

Check if it's hypersomnia,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) is different from feeling tired all the time.
If you have hypersomnia, you may:
regularly nap during the day
fall asleep during the day
still sleep for long hours at night"
What happens at your appointment,"To find out why you're sleeping excessively, a GP might:
ask you about possible causes of your sleepiness, such as mental or physical health problems, or any medicines you may be taking
suggest you keep a diary of when you sleep
refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep disorders
Treatment for excessive sleepiness will depend on what's causing it. It may include medicine to help keep you awake."
Causes of hypersomnia,"Sometimes other conditions may be related to excessive sleepiness (hypersomnia). These conditions can have additional symptoms.
Symptoms and possible causes
Additional symptoms Possible cause
Feeling the need to sleep anywhere, sometimes without warning
Narcolepsy
Loud snorting, breathing and snoring at night
Sleep apnoea
An unusual feeling in your legs, particularly at night
Restless legs syndrome
Low mood, little interest in things
Depression
Mood swings that range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows
Bipolar disorder
Problems recovering after physical activity, problems with thinking, memory or concentration
Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
Some medicines, drinking too much alcohol and taking drugs can also cause excessive daytime sleepiness.
Idiopathic hypersomnia
Idiopathic hypersomnia is when someone sleeps for long periods and wakes up feeling confused or irritable (known as sleep inertia) and not refreshed.
There's no known cause for idiopathic hypersomnia."
Things you can try to help your sleeping habits,"Changing your sleep habits may not cure excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), but it might help you feel better.
Try to:
go to bed at the same time every night
avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine
create a peaceful sleeping environment
if possible, avoid medicines that can cause drowsiness
avoid working late into the night
It might also help to talk to your family and friends about your excessive daytime sleepiness so they're aware of it."
Causes of hirsutism,"Hirsutism is linked to hormones called androgens. It can happen if the level of these hormones increases or if your body becomes more sensitive to them.
The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is a condition affecting the ovaries that can also cause symptoms such as acne and irregular periods.
Sometimes there's no obvious cause.
Rarely, hirsutism can be caused by:
certain medicines
using anabolic steroids
other hormonal conditions like Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly
a tumour affecting your hormone levels
Information:
If you have lighter, finer hair on your face or body, it's probably not hirsutism. Most women get more of this type of hair as they get older, particularly after the menopause."
Treatments for hirsutism,"If you have hirsutism, your GP may suggest:
losing weight if you're overweight – this can help control hormone levels
things you can do at home to remove or lighten the hair – such as shaving, waxing, plucking, hair removal creams or bleaching
a prescription cream to slow hair growth on your face (eflornithine cream)
taking a contraceptive pill if you've not been through the menopause yet – this can help control hormone levels
If these have not helped after 6 months, your GP may refer you to a specialist. They may recommend other medicines to control your hormone levels.
Longer-lasting hair removal
There are treatments that can get rid of unwanted hair for longer than the things you can do at home. But they're not usually permanent.
They're also not usually available on the NHS and can be expensive.
The 2 main treatments are:
electrolysis – where an electric current is used to stop your hair growing
laser hair removal
Make sure you research these treatments before trying them. They both have risks and the results are not the same for everyone."
What is excessive sweating?,"It's normal to sweat if you get hot or do exercise, but you may be sweating excessively if you're sweating when your body does not need to cool down.
Excessive sweating can happen for no obvious reason, because of another condition you may have, or as a side effect of a medicine you're taking."
Things you can do to help with excessive sweating,"Do
wear loose-fitting clothes to minimise signs of sweating
wear socks that absorb moisture and change your socks at least twice a day if possible
wear leather shoes and try to wear different shoes day to day
Don’t
do not wear tight clothes or synthetic fabrics – for example, nylon
do not wear enclosed boots or sports shoes that may cause your feet to sweat more
do not do things that might make your sweating worse – for example, drinking alcohol or eating spicy food
A pharmacist can help with excessive sweating
You can see a pharmacist about excessive sweating. You can buy things without a prescription, such as:
stronger antiperspirants instead of deodorant
armpit or sweat shields to protect your clothing
foot powders for sweaty feet
soap substitutes that are more gentle on your skin
Find a pharmacy"
Treating severe excessive sweating,"If there's no obvious cause for your sweating, and nothing seems to be helping, then you may be referred to a specialist (dermatologist).
They may recommend other treatments that you can try, such as:
taking tablets that reduce sweating
treating the areas with a weak electric current passed through water or on a wet pad (iontophoresis)
having botox injections for sweating under the armpits (this may not be available on the NHS)
surgery – for example, removal of the sweat glands
If your sweating is caused by another condition, any treatment you may need will depend on what's causing it."
Why am I always thirsty?,"Most of the time if you're feeling thirsty it's because you need to drink more fluids.
This can happen if you:
sweat a lot after doing exercise
are unwell with sickness and diarrhoea
do not drink enough fluids
drink too much alcohol or caffeine
eat salty or spicy food
have a high temperature
are pregnant"
Dry mouth or excessive thirst?,"You may think you're thirsty when you actually have a dry mouth.
If it's a dry mouth, you may have:
a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth
changes in your sense of taste
difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing
Find out more about dry mouth"
Symptoms of eye cancer,"Eye cancer does not always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.
Symptoms of eye cancer can include:
shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision
blurred vision
a dark patch in your eye that's getting bigger
partial or total loss of vision
bulging of 1 eye
a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that's increasing in size
eye irritation that is not going away
pain in or around your eye, although this is rare
These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they're not necessarily a sign of cancer.
But it's important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible."
Melanoma of the eye,"Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes.
Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.
Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.
It can also affect the conjunctiva (the thin layer that covers the front of the eye) or the eyelid."
What causes eye melanoma?,"Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:
lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes
white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin
unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing melanoma skin cancer and eye melanoma
use of sunbeds – there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma
overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma
The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s.
There is information about risk factors for other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website."
Diagnosing melanoma of the eye,"If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they'll refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment.
If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer.
There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Glasgow.
It's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:
an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities
an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size
a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour
Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). 
The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back."
Treatments for eye melanoma,"Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour.
Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.
Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.
The main treatments for eye melanoma are:
brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells
external radiotherapy – a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells
surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye
removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you have lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye
Chemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer.

Cancer Research UK: types of eye cancer surgery"
Outlook for eye melanoma,"The outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on many factors.
Eye cancer is rare, so survival rates are based on all eye cancers. For people with eye cancer in England:
95 out of every 100 (95%) will live at least 1 year after diagnosis
70 out of every 100 (70%) will live at least 5 years after diagnosis
60 out of every 100 (60%) will live at least 10 years after diagnosis
There is more information about eye cancer survival on the Cancer Research UK website."
Check if you have floaters and flashes,"Floaters in your vision can look like:
small dark dots
squiggly lines
rings
cobwebs
Flashes look like sudden flashes of light.
They're usually harmless and not a sign of anything serious, especially if:
you've had them for a long time
they're not getting worse
your vision is not affected
Flashes may eventually stop, and floaters often become less noticeable as you get used to them."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have problems with floaters or flashes in your vision your eyes will be checked at an opticians to see if you need to be seen by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) for more tests or treatment.
You'll usually only need treatment if you have a problem that could affect your vision."
Causes of floaters and flashes,"Lots of people, particularly older people, get floaters and flashes.
They're usually caused by a harmless process called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), where the gel inside your eyes changes.
Sometimes they can be caused by retinal detachment.
This is serious and can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated.
Floaters and flashes can also happen for no obvious reason."
Check if it's a herpes simplex eye infection,"Herpes simplex eye infections usually affect only one eye.
The symptoms can be similar to some other eye conditions, and can include:
eye pain
a red eye
watering of your eye
sensitivity to light
blurred vision or other changes to your eyesight
a swollen eyelid
blisters or a rash on your eyelid or the skin around your eye
It's more likely to be a herpes simplex eye infection if you've had one before, or if you've had cold sores.
If you keep getting herpes simplex eye infections they may become less painful."
Treatment for herpes simplex eye infections,"If a GP thinks you have a herpes simplex eye infection they'll refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly.
You'll usually be prescribed either:
an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir, taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets
antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling
Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight.
It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections.
If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant.
Information:
If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone."
How you get herpes simplex eye infections,"Most herpes simplex eye infections are caused by the same herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores.
You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections.
This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury.
You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly."
How to treat an eye injury at home,"Do
wash your eye with clean water if there's something in it
follow the advice on the packaging if any cosmetics or household products get in your eyes
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease any pain or discomfort
Don’t
do not try to remove any object that's pierced your eye
do not touch or rub your eye until it's better
do not wear make-up around your eye until it's better
do not wear contact lenses until your eye is better
How to wash your eye
You should:
use clean water (not hot) – this can be from a tap, shower, or bottled water if you're not at home
hold your eye open
run lots of water over your eyeball for at least 20 minutes
Make sure the flow of water is not too strong."
Other eye injuries,"There is separate information about:
what to do if you have a black eye
what to do if you have a red eye"
Why eye checks are important,"The sooner any eye problem is found, the sooner you and your child will be able to get any treatment and support needed.
Children may not realise they have a vision problem so, without routine tests, there's a risk a problem may not be spotted. This may affect their development and education.
If you have any concerns about your child's vision see a GP or go to an opticians."
When will my child's eyes be checked?,"Your child's eyes may be checked a number of times throughout the first hours, weeks and years of their life.
Within 72 hours of birth
Your child's eyes will be checked for any obvious physical problems as part of the newborn physical examination.
Between 6 and 8 weeks old
This is a follow-up physical examination to check for any obvious problems that were not picked up soon after birth.
Around 1 year, or between 2 and 2-and-a-half years
You may be asked if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight as part of your child's health and development reviews. Eye tests can be arranged if necessary.
Around 4 or 5 years old
Your child's eyes may be examined soon after they start school. This is called vision screening and it checks for reduced vision in one or both eyes. The aim is to detect any problems early so that treatment can be given if needed.
Vision screening is usually carried out in your child's school. However, this does not happen in all areas. If your child's vision is not checked at school, take them to your local opticians for an eye examination.
Read more about vision screening for 4 to 5 year olds (PDF, 1.54Mb).
Speak to a GP or go to an opticians if you have any concerns about your child's vision at any stage."
What tests may be carried out?,"A number of tests may be carried out to check for vision or eye problems in babies and children.
The red reflex test
The red reflex test is usually carried out alongside a general examination of your baby's eyes, as part of newborn checks.
It involves using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope that magnifies the eyes and uses a light so they can be examined clearly.
When light is shone into your baby's eyes, a red reflection should be seen as it's reflected back. If a white reflection is seen, it could be a sign of an eye problem.
The pupil reflex test
The pupil reflex test involves shining a light into each of your baby's eyes to check how their pupils (black dots at the centre of the eyes) react to light.
Your baby's pupils should automatically shrink in response to the light. If they don't, it could be a sign of a problem.
Attention to visual objects
This is a simple test to check whether a newborn baby pays attention to visual objects.
A midwife or doctor will try to attract your baby's attention with an interesting object. They then move it to see if the child's eyes follow.
These sorts of tests can also be used to check the eyesight of older babies and young children who are not yet able to speak.
If your child can speak but is not yet able to recognise letters, pictures may be used instead of objects.
Snellen and LogMAR charts
When your child can recognise or match letters, their vision is tested using charts that have rows of letters and numbers of decreasing sizes.
Your child will be asked to read out or match the letters they can see from a specific distance. These charts are called Snellen or LogMAR charts.
For younger children, a similar test using pictures or symbols may be carried out instead.
Range of movement tests
To test the range of movement of each eye, a child's attention will be drawn to an interesting object, which is then moved to 8 different positions: up, down, left, right, and halfway between each of these points.
This tests how well the eye muscles work.
Refraction test
A refraction test is carried out by an optometrist at a high-street opticians and is used to check if your child needs glasses and, if so, what prescription they need.
Before the test, your child may be given special eyedrops that widen their pupils so the back of their eyes can be examined more clearly.
Your child will be asked to look at a light, or read letters on a chart if they're old enough, while different lenses are placed in front of their eyes.
Colour vision deficiency test
Colour vision deficiency tests, also known as colour blindness tests, are usually carried out in older children if a problem is suspected.
One of the tests used to check for colour blindness is the Ishihara test. This involves looking at images made up of dots in 2 different colours. If a child's colour vision is normal, they'll be able to recognise a letter or number within the image.
A child who can't tell the difference between 2 colours won't be able to see the number or letter, which means they may have a colour vision problem.
Read more about diagnosing colour vision deficiency."
Causes of eye problems in babies and children,"There are a number of different eye problems that can be detected during eye tests, including:
childhood cataracts – cloudy patches in the lens of the eye that are present from birth
lazy eye (amblyopia) – where the vision in one eye does not develop properly
squint (strabismus) – where the eyes look in different directions
short-sightedness (myopia) – where distant objects appear blurred, while close objects can be seen clearly
long-sightedness (hyperopia) – where you can see distant objects clearly but nearby objects are out of focus
astigmatism – where the transparent layer at the front of the eye (cornea) is not perfectly curved
colour vision deficiency (colour blindness) – difficulty seeing colours or distinguishing between different colours; this is more common in boys than girls"
Spotting signs of an eye problem,"Although your child should have regular eye tests as they grow up, it's still important to look out for signs of any problems and get advice if you have any concerns.
For babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check if your child's vision is developing normally.
In older children, signs of a possible eye problem can include:
the eyes not pointing in the same direction
complaining of headaches or eye strain
problems reading – for example, they may need to hold books close to their face and they may lose their place regularly
problems with hand-eye co-ordination – for example, they may struggle to play ball games
being unusually clumsy
regularly rubbing their eyes
sitting too close to the TV
Speak to a GP or go to an opticians if you have any concerns about your child's eyes or vision. The earlier a problem is picked up the better.
Children can have an eyesight test at any age. They do not need to be able to read, or even speak. An eyesight test is particularly important if there's a history of childhood eye problems, such as squint or lazy eye, in your family."
Most eyelid problems are harmless,"Many eyelid problems are not serious.
It's fairly common to have any of these problems:
a lump that goes away by itself after several days or weeks
mildly itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids that clear up by themselves
swelling from a nearby insect bite, injury or operation that goes away after a week or so
twitching or blinking from time to time – often when you're tired
eyelids that droop (or get more ""hooded"") as you get older"
Types of eyelid problems,"Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing your eyelid problem. But do not self-diagnose – see a pharmacist, GP or optician.
Common eyelid problems and possible causes
Eyelid problem Possible cause
Lump or swelling on eyelid
Stye or meibomian cyst (chalazion)
Itchy, flaky, sticky or swollen eyelid
Allergy, blepharitis, or conjunctivitis
Yellow lump or patch on eyelid
Xanthelasma (yellow patches sometimes caused by high cholesterol)
Eyelid turning outwards or inwards
Ectropion or entropion
Hot, painful and swollen eyelid
Cellulitis"
A pharmacist can help with eyelid problems,"You can ask a pharmacist about:
what you can do to treat common eyelid problems, like a stye or conjunctivitis, yourself
if you can buy anything to help – for example, cleaning solutions for sticky eyelids
if you need to see an optician or GP
Find a pharmacy"
Check if you have prosopagnosia (face blindness),"The main symptom of prosopagnosia is having difficulty recognising faces. You'll still see the parts of a face normally, but all faces may look the same to you.
It affects people differently. Some people may not be able to tell the difference between strangers or people they do not know well. Others may not recognise the faces of friends and family, or even their own face.
Other symptoms of prosopagnosia can include difficulty with:
recognising emotions on people's faces
recognising people's age and gender
recognising characters and following plots in TV programmes or films
recognising other things, such as cars or animals
finding your way around
Difficulty recognising faces may make it harder to form relationships, or cause problems at work or school.
This may affect your mental health and may lead to social anxiety or depression."
Things you can try to help with prosopagnosia (face blindness),"There's no treatment for prosopagnosia, but there are things you can do to help recognise people.
Do
tell people about the condition before you meet them
ask people you're close to for help identifying others
ask people to introduce themselves when you greet them
use people's voices or body language to tell them apart
make a note of distinctive features about a person such as hairstyle, jewellery or accessories
use name tags or write down the names of colleagues and where they sit at work"
Causes of prosopagnosia (face blindness),"Prosopagnosia is caused by a problem with the part of the brain that processes information about faces.
It can happen:
if you do not develop the ability to recognise faces – this is the most common type and may run in families
from brain damage, such as following a stroke, head injury, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), or Alzheimer's disease
if you're autistic"

Causes of fainting,"There are many reasons why someone might faint.
Causes include:
standing up too quickly – this could be a sign of low blood pressure
not eating or drinking enough
being too hot
being very upset, angry or in severe pain
heart problems
taking drugs or drinking too much alcohol"
Symptoms of fainting,"Fainting usually happens suddenly. Symptoms can include:
dizziness
cold skin and sweating
feeling warm or hot
feeling sick
changes to your vision"
Things you can do to prevent fainting,"If you feel like you're about to faint, try to:
lie down with your legs raised – if you cannot do this, then sit with your head lowered between your knees
drink some water
eat something
take some deep breaths"
If you see someone faint,"If you're with someone who has fainted, try to keep calm.
If you can, lay them on their back and raise their legs.
If they’re pregnant (especially if they’re more than 28 weeks pregnant), it’s better to lay them on their side.
Usually, the person who has fainted will wake up within 20 seconds."
What should I do if I fall?,"If you have a fall, it's important to keep calm. If you're not hurt and you feel strong enough to get up, do not get up quickly.
Roll onto your hands and knees and look for a stable piece of furniture, such as a chair or bed.
Hold on to the furniture with both hands to support yourself and, when you feel ready, slowly get up. Sit down and rest for a while before carrying on with your daily activities.
If you're hurt or unable to get up, try to get someone's attention by calling out for help, banging on the wall or floor, or using your personal alarm or security system (if you have one). If possible, crawl to a telephone and dial 999 to ask for an ambulance.
Try to reach something warm, such as a blanket or dressing gown, to put over you, particularly your legs and feet.
Stay as comfortable as possible and try to change your position at least once every half an hour or so.
You may want to get a personal alarm system so that you can signal for help in the event of a fall.
An alternative would be to always keep a mobile phone in your pocket so you can phone for help after having a fall.
If you're living with or caring for an elderly person, read what to do after an incident."
What causes a fall?,"The natural ageing process means that older people have an increased risk of having a fall.
Older people are more likely to have a fall because they may have:
balance problems and muscle weakness
vision loss
a long-term health condition, such as heart disease, dementia or low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness and a brief loss of consciousness
A fall is also more likely to happen if:
floors are wet, such as in the bathroom, or recently polished
the lighting in the room is dim
rugs or carpets are not properly secured
the person reaches for storage areas, such as a cupboard, or is going down stairs
the person is rushing to get to the toilet during the day or at night
Another common cause of falls, particularly among older men, is falling from a ladder while carrying out home maintenance work.
In older people, falls can be particularly problematic because osteoporosis is a fairly common problem.
It can develop in both men and women, particularly in people who smoke, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, take steroid medicine, or have a family history of hip fractures.
But older women are most at risk because osteoporosis is often associated with the hormonal changes that occur during the menopause."
Preventing a fall,"There are several simple measures that can help prevent falls in the home.
For example:
using non-slip mats in the bathroom
mopping up spills to prevent wet, slippery floors
ensuring all rooms, passages and staircases are well lit
removing clutter
getting help lifting or moving items that are heavy or difficult to lift
The charity Age UK has more advice about home adaptations to make tasks easier.
Healthcare professionals take falls in older people very seriously because of the huge consequences they can have for the health and wellbeing of this group.
As a result, there's a great deal of help and support available for older people, and it's worth asking a GP about the various options.
The GP may carry out some simple tests to check your balance. They can also review any medicines you're taking in case their side effects may increase your risk of falling.
The GP may also recommend:
looking after your eyes with a sight test if you're having problems with your vision, even if you already wear glasses
having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and checking your blood pressure while lying and standing
requesting a home hazard assessment, where a healthcare professional visits your home to identify potential hazards and give advice
doing exercises to improve your strength and balance (read about physical activity guidelines for older adults)

Check if your farting is normal,"Farting is usually nothing to worry about. Everyone farts, some people more than others.
What's normal is different for everyone. If you notice a change or it's affecting your life, there are things you can do."
Things you can do to cut down excessive or smelly farts,"Do
eat smaller meals, more often
drink or chew food slowly, with your mouth closed
exercise regularly to improve how your body digests food
drink peppermint tea
Don’t
do not chew gum, smoke, or suck pen tops or hard sweets (to avoid swallowing air)
do not wear loose-fitting dentures
do not eat too many foods that are difficult to digest and make you fart
do not drink too much beer, wine or fruit juice
Food and drinks that can make you fart
A pharmacist can help with excessive or smelly farts
Speak to a pharmacist about excessive or smelly farts.
They might be able to tell you:
if you can buy something to help – for example, charcoal tablets or special underwear and pads that absorb smells
if you should see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
What causes excessive or smelly farts,"Excessive or smelly farts can be caused when you swallow air or eat foods that are difficult to digest. It can also sometimes be a sign of a health condition.
Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried about your farting.
Possible causes of farting
Symptoms Possible causes
Difficulty pooing and stomach pain Constipation
Bloating, stomach pain with diarrhoea or constipation that comes and goes Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea and stomach pain Coeliac disease
Diarrhoea, bloating, stomach pain, feeling sick Lactose intolerance
Excessive or smelly wind can also be a side effect of some medicines, including:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), like ibuprofen
some laxatives
antifungal medicines
statins
Do not stop or change your medicine without speaking to a GP first."
Check if it's a febrile seizure,"A febrile seizure can happen when a child has a high temperature (fever).
Your child may:
become stiff and twitch, shake, or have jerking movements
become unconscious
not respond or look at you when you talk to them
be sick or pee (wet themselves)
be sleepy, irritable or confused for up to 1 hour afterwards
Febrile seizures usually last for 2 to 3 minutes. It's rare for them to last more than 10 minutes.
They usually affect children between 6 months and 6 years old."
What to do if your child is having a febrile seizure,"If your child is having a febrile seizure, it's important to keep them safe while you wait for medical help.
Do
check the time the seizure starts and ends
protect their head with your hands or something soft
remove any dangerous objects that are nearby
after the seizure ends, put your child in the recovery position and make sure there is nothing in their mouth or throat that might affect their breathing
Don’t
do not move your child or try to hold them in place
do not put anything in your child's mouth
do not try to lower your child's temperature by undressing them or sponging them with cold water"
Treatment for febrile seizures,"Most febrile seizures do not need treatment. But your child will need to be checked in hospital after having a febrile seizure for the first time. They may also need to stay in hospital for a short time.
Your child may need some tests, including:
blood tests
pee (urine) test
a lumbar puncture – where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses
If an infection is causing your child's high temperature, they may need medicine to treat it.
Treatment for recurrent febrile seizures
Very rarely, a child may keep having febrile seizures.
If this happens, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to give to your child while they're having a seizure. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to use it."
Preventing febrile seizures,You cannot prevent febrile seizures. They can sometimes happen when your child has an infection and a high temperature.
Things that may help you stop feeling sick,"Do
get plenty of fresh air
distract yourself – for example, listen to music or watch a film
take regular sips of a cold drink
drink ginger or peppermint tea
eat foods containing ginger – such as ginger biscuits
eat smaller, more frequent meals
Don’t
do not eat or cook strong-smelling food
do not eat hot, fried or greasy food
do not eat too quickly
do not have a large drink with meals
do not lie down soon after eating
do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist or tummy"
Common causes of feeling sick,"Lots of things can make you feel sick.
Any other symptoms you have may give you an idea of the cause. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Possible causes of feeling sick.
Other symptoms Possible cause
Diarrhoea or vomiting Norovirus or food poisoning
Headache and a high temperature An infection, such as flu
Heartburn or bloating after eating Acid reflux
Headache and sensitivity to light or sound Migraine

Getting help and support,"All women and girls have the right to control what happens to their bodies and the right to say no to FGM.
Help is available if you have had FGM or you're worried that you or someone you know is at risk.
If someone is in immediate danger, contact the police immediately by dialling 999.
If you're concerned that someone may be at risk, contact the NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 3550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk.
If you're under pressure to have FGM performed on your daughter, ask a GP, your health visitor or another healthcare professional for help, or contact the NSPCC helpline.
If you have had FGM, you can get help from a specialist NHS gynaecologist or FGM service – ask a GP, your midwife or any other healthcare professional about services in your area. 
Read about National FGM Support Clinics and where to find them.
If you're a health professional caring for a patient under 18 who's had FGM, you have professional responsibilities to safeguard and protect her. 
Guidance and resources about FGM for healthcare staff are available on the GOV.UK website."
Types of FGM,"There are 4 main types of FGM:
type 1 (clitoridectomy) – removing part or all of the clitoris
type 2 (excision) – removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (the lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (the larger outer lips)
type 3 (infibulation) – narrowing the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia
other harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area
FGM is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. But in some countries it may be done by a medical professional.
Anaesthetics and antiseptics are not generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.
FGM often happens against a girl's will without her consent, and girls may have to be forcibly restrained."
Effects of FGM,"There are no health benefits to FGM and it can cause serious harm, including:
constant pain
pain and difficulty having sex
repeated infections, which can lead to infertility
bleeding, cysts and abscesses
problems peeing or holding pee in (incontinence)
depression, flashbacks and self-harm
problems during labour and childbirth, which can be life threatening for mother and baby
Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result of the procedure.
FGM and sex
FGM can make it difficult and painful to have sex. It can also result in reduced sexual desire and a lack of pleasurable sensation.
Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you have sexual problems that you feel may be caused by FGM, as they can refer you to a special therapist who can help.
In some cases, a surgical procedure called a deinfibulation may be recommended, which can alleviate and improve some symptoms.
FGM and pregnancy
Some women with FGM may find it difficult to become pregnant, and those who do conceive can have problems in childbirth.
If you're expecting a baby, your midwife should ask you if you have had FGM at your antenatal appointment.
It's important to tell your midwife if you think this has happened to you so they can arrange appropriate care for you and you baby.
FGM and mental health
FGM can be an extremely traumatic experience that can cause emotional difficulties throughout life, including;
depression
anxiety
flashbacks to the time of the cutting
nightmares and other sleep problems
In some cases, women may not remember having the FGM at all, especially if it was performed when they were an infant.
Talk to a GP or another healthcare professional if you're experiencing emotional or mental health problems that may be a result of FGM. Help and support is available."
Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation),"Surgery can be performed to open up the vagina, if necessary. This is called deinfibulation.
It's sometimes known as a reversal, although this name is misleading as the procedure does not replace any removed tissue and will not undo the damage caused. 
But it can help many problems caused by FGM.
Surgery may be recommended for:
women who are unable to have sex or have difficulty peeing as a result of FGM
pregnant women at risk of problems during labour or delivery as a result of FGM
Deinfibulation should be carried out before getting pregnant, if possible.
It can be done in pregnancy or labour if necessary, but ideally should be done before the last 2 months of pregnancy.
The surgery involves making a cut (incision) to open the scar tissue over the entrance to the vagina.
It's usually performed under local anaesthetic in a clinic and you will not normally need to stay overnight.
A small number of women need either a general anaesthetic or an injection in the back (epidural), which may involve a short stay in hospital."
Why FGM is carried out,"FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to preserve her virginity).
But there are no acceptable reasons that justify FGM. It's a harmful practice that has no health benefits.
FGM usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had FGM themselves, or if their father comes from a community where it's carried out."
Where FGM is carried out,"Girls are sometimes taken abroad for FGM, but they may not be aware this is the reason for their travel.
Girls are more at risk of FGM being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for them to ""heal"" before they return to school.
If you think there's a risk of this happening to you, you can download the Statement Opposing FGM on GOV.UK and take it with you on holiday to show your family.
Communities that perform FGM are traditionally found in many parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
Girls who were born in the UK or are resident here but whose families originate from an FGM-practising community are at greater risk of FGM happening to them.
Many communities practise FGM, but those at particular risk in the UK originate from:
Somalia
Egypt
Sudan
Sierra Leone
Eritrea
Gambia
Ethiopia"
The law and FGM,"FGM is illegal in the UK.
It's an offence to:
perform FGM (including taking a child abroad for FGM)
help a girl perform FGM on herself in or outside the UK
help anyone perform FGM in the UK
help anyone perform FGM outside the UK on a UK national or resident
fail to protect a girl for whom you're responsible from FGM
Anyone who performs FGM can face up to 14 years in prison.
Anyone found guilty of failing to protect a girl from FGM can face up to 7 years in prison."
Download the Statement Opposing FGM,"The summer holidays are when many young girls are taken abroad, often to their family's birth country, to have FGM performed.
The FGM statement, also known as the FGM health passport, highlights the fact FGM is a serious criminal offence in the UK.
If you're worried about FGM, print out this statement, take it abroad with you and show it to your family.
Keep the declaration in your passport, purse or bag, and carry it with you all the time.

Femoral hernia,"A femoral hernia is a rare type of hernia.
Femoral hernias sometimes appear as a painful lump in the inner upper part of the thigh or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear.
For information on other types of hernia, see: 
inguinal hernia
hiatus hernia
umbilical hernia"
Causes of a femoral hernia,"A femoral hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.
It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall) into an area called the femoral canal.
Unlike inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are far more common in women, particularly older women. This is because of the wider shape of the female pelvis. Femoral hernias are rare in children.
Femoral hernias can sometimes appear suddenly because of strain on the tummy, such as:
straining on the toilet if you have constipation
carrying and pushing heavy loads
They've also been linked to obesity and having a persistent, heavy cough."
When surgery is needed,"Femoral hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the wall of the tummy.
Unlike some other types of hernia, treatment of femoral hernias is almost always recommended straight away because there's a higher risk of complications developing in these cases.
Complications that can develop as a result of a femoral hernia include:
obstruction – where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the femoral canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin
strangulation – where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it does not die
Surgery gets rid of the hernia and prevents any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation."
What happens during surgery,"There are 2 ways a femoral hernia repair can be performed:
open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into your tummy
laparoscopy (keyhole) surgery – a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various instruments to repair the hernia
There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon's experience.
You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the hospital's instructions on how to look after yourself. This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound and not straining yourself too soon.
Most people make a full recovery from femoral hernia repair within 6 weeks, although many people can return to driving, work and light activities within 2 weeks.
Read more about:
how femoral hernia repair is performed
recovering from femoral hernia repair"
Risks of femoral hernia repair,"Femoral hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks, although in a small number of cases, the hernia returns after the operation.
Other uncommon complications of femoral hernia repair include:
developing a lump under the wound
difficulty passing urine
injury or narrowing of the femoral vein (which passes through the femoral canal)
injury to the bowel
temporary weakness of the leg
injury to the nerves, causing pain or numbness in the groin area
Complications are more likely in older people or those with existing conditions."
What is a high temperature?,"Normal body temperature is different for everyone and changes during the day.
A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or above. This is sometimes called a fever."
Check if you have a high temperature,"You may have a high temperature if:
your chest or back feel hotter than usual
you have other symptoms, such as shivering (chills), sweating or warm, red skin (this may be harder to see on black or brown skin)
a thermometer says your temperature is 38C or above
Important
If you feel hot or shivery, you may have a high temperature even if a thermometer says your temperature is below 38C."
Treating a high temperature,"There are some things you can do to help treat a high temperature.
Do
get lots of rest
drink plenty of fluids (water is best) to avoid dehydration – drink enough so your pee is light yellow and clear
take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable
Information:
Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you do not have a high temperature."
Causes of a high temperature,"Many things can cause a high temperature. It's not usually a sign of anything serious.
It's often just caused by your body fighting an infection, such as a cold or flu.
Sometimes it could be a sign of something more serious if your temperature is very high or will not come down."
Checking a high temperature,"A normal temperature in babies and children can vary slightly from child to child.
A high temperature is 38C or more.
If your child has a high temperature, they might:
feel hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest
feel sweaty
look or feel unwell
have a seizure or fit, called a febrile seizure
Use a digital thermometer, which you can buy from pharmacies and supermarkets, to take your child's temperature."
What to do if your child has a high temperature,"If your child or baby has a high temperature, you can usually look after them at home. The temperature should go down over 1 to 4 days.
Do
give them plenty of fluids – if your baby is breastfed, continue to breastfeed as normal
look out for signs of dehydration
give them food if they want it
check on your child regularly, including during the night
keep them at home
give them paracetamol or ibuprofen if they're distressed or uncomfortable – check the packaging or leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child, or speak to a pharmacist or GP if you're not sure
get medical advice if you're worried about your child
Don’t
do not undress your child or sponge them down to cool them – a high temperature is a natural and healthy response to infection
do not cover them up in too many clothes or bedclothes
do not give aspirin to children under 16 years of age
do not combine ibuprofen and paracetamol, unless a GP tells you to
do not give paracetamol to a child under 2 months
do not give ibuprofen to a child who is under 3 months, weighs under 5kg, has chickenpox, or is dehydrated
do not give ibuprofen to children with asthma unless it's been recommended by a doctor"
Causes of a high temperature in children,"A high temperature is the body's natural response to fighting infections like coughs and colds.
Many things can cause a high temperature in children, from common childhood illnesses like chickenpox and tonsillitis, to vaccinations."
Seeing a GP,"As fibroids do not often cause symptoms, they're sometimes diagnosed by chance during a routine gynaecological examination, test or scan.
See a GP if you have symptoms of fibroids so they can investigate possible causes.
If the GP thinks you may have fibroids, they'll usually refer you for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis.
Read more about diagnosing fibroids."
Why fibroids develop,"The exact cause of fibroids is unknown, but they have been linked to the hormone oestrogen.
Oestrogen is the female reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries (the female reproductive organs).
Fibroids usually develop during a woman's reproductive years (from around the age of 16 to 50) when oestrogen levels are at their highest.
They tend to shrink when oestrogen levels are low, such as after the menopause when a woman's monthly period stops."
Who gets fibroids?,"Fibroids are common, with around 2 in 3 women developing at least 1 fibroid at some point in their life. They most often occur in women aged 30 to 50.
Fibroids are thought to develop more frequently in women of African-Caribbean origin.
It's also thought they occur more often in overweight or obese women because being overweight increases the level of oestrogen in the body.
Women who have had children have a lower risk of developing fibroids."
Types of fibroids,"Fibroids can grow anywhere in the womb and vary in size considerably. Some can be the size of a pea, whereas others can be the size of a melon.
The main types of fibroids are:
intramural fibroids – the most common type of fibroid, which develop in the muscle wall of the womb
subserosal fibroids – fibroids that develop outside the wall of the womb into the pelvis and can become very large
submucosal fibroids – fibroids that develop in the muscle layer beneath the womb's inner lining and grow into the cavity of the womb
In some cases, subserosal or submucosal fibroids are attached to the womb with a narrow stalk of tissue. These are known as pedunculated fibroids.
Credit:"
Treating fibroids,"Fibroids do not need to be treated if they are not causing symptoms. After the menopause, they'll often shrink without treatment.
If you do have symptoms caused by fibroids, medicine to help relieve the symptoms will usually be recommended first.
There are also medications available to help shrink fibroids. If these prove ineffective, surgery or other, less invasive procedures may be recommended.

Symptoms of fibromyalgia,"As well as widespread pain, other symptoms of fibromyalgia include:
increased sensitivity to pain
muscle stiffness
difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, which can make you feel very tired (fatigue)
problems with mental processes (known as ""fibro-fog""), such as difficulty concentrating or remembering things
headaches
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating
feelings of frustration, worry or low mood
The symptoms of fibromyalgia are changeable – for example, they can sometimes suddenly improve or get worse.
See a GP if you think you have fibromyalgia. Treatment can ease some of the symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely."
How fibromyalgia is treated,"Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with.
Treatment tends to be a combination of:
lifestyle changes, such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques
talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
medicine, such as antidepressants
In particular, exercise has a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain."
What causes fibromyalgia?,"The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body.
It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents.
In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by things that are physical or emotional like an injury, an infection or stress."
Who's affected,"Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, but it's more common in women than men.
The condition typically develops between the ages of 25 and 55, but people of any age can get it, including children and older people.
It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition.
Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree.
One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose.
There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions."
Support groups,"If you have fibromyalgia, support groups can provide an important network for talking to others living with the condition.
Fibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia.
If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 3333.
Fibromyalgia Action UK also has a number of regional co-ordinators who can put you in touch with a support group near you.

How you can ease finger pain yourself,"If you see a GP about pain in your finger, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your finger when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your finger for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
take paracetamol to ease the pain
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
remove any jewellery on the painful finger
strap the painful finger to another finger next to it – put a small piece of cotton wool or gauze between the 2 fingers and use tape to loosely strap them together
think about using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
do not stop using your finger completely – after a few days, do gentle hands and finger exercises to help ease any stiffness
A pharmacist can help with finger pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
splints to support your finger and ease pain – flexible rubber splints are available if you still need to use your finger

What to do,"If someone is injured, you should:
first check that you and the injured person aren't in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe
if necessary, dial 999 for an ambulance when it's safe to do so
carry out basic first aid
Find out what to do after an incident
If someone is unconscious and breathing
If someone is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives.
Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally.
If someone is unconscious and not breathing
If someone is not breathing normally, call 999 and start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) straight away.
Find out more about CPR"
Common accidents and emergencies,"Here are some of the most common injuries that may need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them.
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or eating certain foods.
The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen).
During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock.
Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe.
You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself.
After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. 
All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given.
Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive.
If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them.
Find out how to treat anaphylaxis
Bleeding heavily
If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock.
First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.
If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on.
Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object.
Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging to avoid putting pressure on the object itself.
Do not try to remove it because it may be helping to slow down the bleeding.
If nothing is embedded:
Apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible. Continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops.
Use a clean dressing or any clean, soft material to bandage the wound firmly.
If bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound until the bleeding stops, and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place. Do not remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped.
If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film. Do not wash the severed limb.
Wrap the package in soft fabric and place in a container of crushed ice. Do not let the limb touch the ice.
Make sure the severed limb goes with the patient to hospital.
Always seek medical help for bleeding, unless it's minor.
Find out how to treat cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds.
Burns and scalds
If someone has a burn or scald:
Cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved.
Call 999 or seek medical help, if needed.
While cooling the burn, and before the area begins to swell, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin.
If you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia).
If the burn has cooled, cover it loosely with cling film. If cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material. Do not wrap the burn tightly as swelling may lead to further injury.
Do not apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn.
If you are not sure if medical help is needed or what to do next, call 111 or get help from 111 online.
Find out how to treat burns and scalds
Chemical burns
For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to remove the chemical.
If possible, determine the cause of the injury.
In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use.
Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary.
Call 999 for immediate medical help.
Choking
The following information is for choking in adults. There is separate advice on how to stop a child from choking.
Mild choking
If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe.
In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves.
If choking is mild:
Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage.
Ask them to try to spit out the object if it's in their mouth.
Do not put your fingers in their mouth if you can't see the object, as you risk pushing it further down their mouth.
If coughing doesn't work, start back blows.
Severe choking 
If choking is severe, the person won't be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they'll eventually become unconscious. If coughing doesn't work start back blows.
How to do back blows
To help an adult or child over 1 year old:
Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with 1 hand. Lean the person forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.
Give up to 5 sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).
Check if the blockage has cleared.
If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts.
Do not give abdominal thrusts to babies under 1 year old or to pregnant women.
To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn't in one of the above groups:
Stand behind the person who is choking.
Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward.
Clench 1 fist and place it just above the person's belly button.
Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.
Repeat this up to 5 times.
The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all 5.
If the person's airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts:
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the 999 operator that the person is choking.
Continue with the cycles of 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until help arrives.
The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain.
Drowning
If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water unless it's safe to do so. Don't put yourself at risk.
Once the person is on land, you need to check if they're breathing. Ask someone to call 999 for medical help.
If they're not breathing, open the airway and give 5 initial rescue breaths before starting CPR.
Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths.
If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately.
Continue watching the patient to ensure they don't stop breathing and continue to breathe normally.
Electric shock (domestic)
If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply.
If you can't reach the mains supply:
Do not go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off.
Once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 to for an ambulance.
Afterwards, seek medical help.
Fractures
It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone.
If the person is unconscious or is bleeding heavily, these must be dealt with first by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. See the section on bleeding heavily above.
If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital.
Once you have done this, decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car.
If the pain isn't too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. Get someone else to drive if possible so you can care for the person who is injured during the trip.
But call 999 if:
they're in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication – call an ambulance and do not move them
it's obvious they have a broken leg – do not move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance
you suspect they have injured or broken their back – call an ambulance and do not move them
Do not give the person who is injured anything to eat or drink, as they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital.

Heart attack
A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK.
If you think someone is having or has had a heart attack, call 999 and then move them into a comfortable sitting position.
Symptoms of a heart attack include:
chest pain – the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down 1 or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)
Sit the person down and make them comfortable.
If they can, it's best for them to sit on the floor with their knees bent and their head and shoulders supported. If possible, place cushions behind them or under their knees.
If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly, (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin, for example if they are under 16 or they say they are allergic to it).
If the person has any medication for angina, help them to take it.
Monitor their vital signs, such as their breathing, until help arrives.
If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR.
Call 999 to tell them you think the person is now in cardiac arrest (their heart has stopped beating).
Poisoning
Poisoning is potentially life threatening.
Common causes of poisoning include:
swallowing a toxic substance, such as bleach
taking an overdose of a prescription medicine
eating something, like wild plants and fungi
Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms.
If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 to get immediate medical help and advice.
The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation.
The following advice is important:
Find out what's been swallowed so you can tell the paramedic or doctor.
Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to.
Do not try to cause vomiting.
Stay with the person, as their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious.
If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR.
Do not perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the person's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison.
Do not leave them if they're unconscious: they could vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.
If they do vomit naturally, try to collect some of it for the ambulance crew – this may help identify the cause of the poisoning.
If the patient is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and keep checking they're breathing normally.
Find out more about treatment for poisoning and alcohol poisoning.
Shock
In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock.
Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen.
This is usually the result of severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, a bacterial infection, or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).
The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident.
Signs of shock include:
pale, cold, clammy skin
sweating
rapid, shallow breathing
weakness and dizziness
feeling sick and possibly vomiting
thirst
yawning
sighing
Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of these signs of shock.
You should:
call 999 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance
treat any obvious injuries
lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs
use a coat or blanket to keep them warm
do not give them anything to eat or drink
give them lots of comfort and reassurance
monitor the person – if they stop breathing, start CPR and call 999 to update them
Stroke
The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke.
The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away.
If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide:
Face – the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have drooped.
Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm.
Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake.
Time – it's time to dial 999 immediately if you notice any of these signs or symptoms.
If a person had symptoms of a stroke but they do not have them now, you should still call 999 as it may have been a mini-stroke (also called a transient ischaemic attack or TIA).
Find out more about the symptoms of a stroke."
Calling 999 to get help in an emergency,"When you call 999, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as:
your telephone number
the address you're calling from
a brief description of what's wrong with the person and whether they're bleeding, unconscious or not breathing
The call handler may advise you on what you can do until help arrives."
When to call an ambulance,"Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if:
it's the first time someone has had a seizure
the seizure lasts longer than is usual for them
the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, if you do not know how long their seizures usually last
the person does not regain full consciousness, or has several seizures without regaining consciousness
the person is seriously injured during the seizure
the person has difficulty breathing after the seizure
People with epilepsy do not always need an ambulance or to go to hospital every time they have a seizure.
They usually have a care plan agreed with doctors and their family or carers that says what to do when they have a seizure, such as giving emergency medicine. If you know what to do and have been trained then you can follow their care plan.
Some people with epilepsy wear a special bracelet or carry a card to let medical professionals and anyone witnessing a seizure know they have epilepsy.
Epilepsy Action has more information about seizures that last longer than 5 minutes."
Make a note of any useful information,"If you see someone having a seizure, you may notice things that could be useful for the person or their doctor to know:
What were they doing before the seizure?
Did the person mention any unusual sensations, such as an odd smell or taste?
Did you notice any mood change, such as excitement, anxiety or anger?
What brought your attention to the seizure? Was it a noise, such as the person falling over, or body movements, such as their eyes rolling or head turning?
Did the seizure happen without warning?
Was there any loss of consciousness or altered awareness?
Did the person's colour change? For example, did they become paler than usual, flushed, blue or grey? If so, where – the face, lips or hands? On brown or black skin, changes in colour may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids.
Did any parts of their body stiffen, jerk or twitch? If so, which parts?
Did the person's breathing change?
Did they perform any actions, such as mumble, wander about or fumble with clothing?
How long did the seizure last?
Did the person lose control of their bladder or bowel?
Did they bite their tongue?
How were they after the seizure?
Did they need to sleep? If so, for how long?
You can watch healthtalk.org videos of people talking about having epileptic seizures.
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) also has useful leaflets you can download about a first seizure without a fever in children and young people."
Keeping a seizure diary,"If you have epilepsy, it can be helpful to record the details of your seizures in a diary.

Check if you have flat feet,"To see if you have flat feet, check the inner sides of your feet while you're standing up.
If you have flat feet, your feet will be flat on the ground.
Credit:
You do not have flat feet if the inside part of your foot is raised off the ground (this is called the arch).
Credit:
Flat feet do not usually need to be treated
You do not need to do anything if you or your child have flat feet and they're not causing any problems.
Most children have flat feet until they're about 6 years of age. After this time, they usually develop an arch.
Flat feet:
do not usually cause any problems
should not stop you doing any activities, including sports
are rarely a sign of anything serious
But sometimes, you may have pain around your ankle or the arch of your foot may ache. Your shoes may also wear out quickly."
Treatments for flat feet,"If flat feet are causing problems and you need treatment, a GP may refer you to a specialist like a podiatrist or physiotherapist.
Referral to a specialist is not available everywhere and waiting times can be long.
Your GP might be able to give you advice about paying to see a specialist privately.
A foot specialist can offer advice about:
what shoes to wear (wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel are usually best)
shoe insoles to support your feet
foot stretches and exercises
painkillers
These will not change the shape of your feet, but can help with things like pain or stiffness.
Surgery for flat feet
Surgery is rarely needed for flat feet.
It might help if there's a problem with the bones, tissues or muscles in your feet and other treatments have not worked.
Your GP may refer you to a surgeon if they think surgery might help."
Causes of flat feet,"There's often no obvious cause for flat feet. It might just be the way your feet are.
Sometimes flat feet run in families.
Rarely, flat feet may be caused by:
the bones in the feet not growing properly in the womb
stretching of the tissues in your feet (possibly as a result of things like an injury, getting older or being overweight)
conditions affecting the muscles, nerves or joints in the whole body like cerebral palsy and spina bifida"
Check if you have flu,"Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:
a sudden high temperature
an aching body
feeling tired or exhausted
a dry cough
a sore throat
a headache
difficulty sleeping
loss of appetite
diarrhoea or tummy pain
feeling sick and being sick
The symptoms are similar for children, but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active."
How to treat flu yourself,"If you have flu, there are some things you can do to help get better more quickly.
Do
rest and sleep
keep warm
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration (your pee should be light yellow or clear)
A pharmacist can help with flu
A pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies.
Do not take paracetamol and flu remedies that contain paracetamol at the same time as it's easy to take more than the recommended dose.
Find a pharmacy"
How to avoid spreading the flu,"Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You're more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days.
Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
To reduce the risk of spreading flu:
wash your hands often with warm water and soap
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze (if you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the bend of your elbow, not into your hand)
bin used tissues as quickly as possible
Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities."
How to get a flu vaccine,"Flu vaccines are safe and effective. They're offered every year on the NHS to help protect people at risk of flu and its complications.
The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn before flu starts spreading. But you can get vaccinated later.

Tooth decay,"Tooth decay, also known as dental decay or dental caries, is a major health concern worldwide and is still a big problem in the UK.
Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth tissue caused by acids made by bacteria in dental plaque. Dental plaque is a sticky film that constantly forms on the teeth. Each time you have sugary food and drink, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks teeth.
If you eat or drink sugary foods frequently throughout the day, you have more ""acid attacks,"" which can lead to tooth decay. This can eventually lead to cavities (holes) in the teeth and infection, which is why teeth sometimes need to be removed.
Read more about the causes of tooth decay"
Fluoride toothpaste,"Brushing your teeth thoroughly with fluoride toothpaste is one of the most effective ways of preventing tooth decay.
A range of toothpastes are available containing different levels of fluoride. The amount of fluoride in the toothpaste can be found on the side of the tube and is measured in parts per million (ppm).
Toothpastes containing 1,350 to 1,500ppm fluoride are the most effective. Your dentist may advise you to use higher-strength toothpaste if you or your child is at particular risk of tooth decay.
Children under 3 years old should brush twice daily, with a smear of toothpaste containing at least 1,000ppm fluoride.
Children between 3 and 6 years old should brush at least twice daily with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing more than 1,000ppm fluoride.
Children over 7 and adults should brush at least twice daily with a toothpaste containing 1,350-1,500ppm fluoride.
Both adults and children should spit toothpaste out instead of rinsing with water after brushing.
Don't use mouthwash at the same time as brushing. Use it at an alternative time, because it washes away the fluoride in the toothpaste

Fluoride dental treatments,"Fluoride mouth rinses
Fluoride mouth rinses can be prescribed for adults and children aged 8 and above who have tooth decay. They should be used every day, in addition to brushing twice daily with toothpaste containing at least 1,350ppm fluoride.
Rinses should be used at different times to brushing to avoid washing the toothpaste off your teeth, as this reduces the beneficial effects of the fluoride in the toothpaste.
Fluoride varnish
Fluoride varnish can be applied to both baby teeth and adult teeth by a dentist. The process involves painting a varnish containing high levels of fluoride onto the surface of the tooth twice a year to prevent decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay.
Its use is strongly recommended for children and adults who are at higher risk of tooth decay, such as older people.
Ask your dentist about fluoride varnish.
Find a dentist near you"
Community water fluoridation,"Most water supplies contain some fluoride and in the early 20th century, levels of tooth decay were found to be associated with fluoride levels in drinking water.
This led to the introduction of schemes to add fluoride to water supplies to improve dental health.
Community water fluoridation schemes have operated for many years; the first scheme was introduced in the US in 1945. The first substantive UK scheme was established in Birmingham in 1964.
Community water fluoridation in England
Millions of people in England receive fluoridated water. This means fluoride has been added to bring it up to around 1mg of fluoride per litre of water, which is a level found to reduce tooth decay levels.
The decision about whether to add fluoride to the water supply is made by individual local authorities. Areas where water fluoridation schemes are currently in place include parts of:
the West Midlands
the North East
the East Midlands
Eastern England
the North West
Yorkshire and Humber
Your local water supplier should be able to tell you how much fluoride is in your water supply and whether any is added. Most companies have an online facility where you can use your postcode to check the water in your area.
What research has been carried out?
There have been several reviews of the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation schemes.
Recent large reviews that have been carried out include:
An evaluation of water fluoridation scheme in Cumbria – in 2021
Royal Society of New Zealand: Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1Mb) – in 2014
Cochrane Oral Health Group: Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries – in 2015
Overall, these reviews found that water fluoridation appears to contribute to reduced tooth decay levels and doesn't seem to be associated with any significant health risks."
Is fluoride safe?,"There have been some concerns that fluoride may be linked to a variety of health conditions. Reviews of the risks have so far found no convincing evidence to support these concerns.
However, a condition called dental fluorosis can sometimes occur if a child's teeth are exposed to too much fluoride when they're developing.
Read more about looking after children's teeth and looking after your baby's teeth.
Mild dental fluorosis can be seen as very fine, pearly white lines or flecking on the surface of the teeth. Severe fluorosis can cause the tooth's enamel to become pitted or discoloured.
It's uncommon in the UK for fluorosis to be severe enough to seriously affect the appearance of teeth. This is because fluoride levels in water are carefully monitored by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and adjusted if necessary."
Characteristics of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),"FASD can cause problems with:
movement, balance, vision and hearing
learning, such as problems with thinking, concentration, and memory
managing emotions and developing social skills
hyperactivity and impulse control
communication, such as problems with speech
the joints, muscles, bones, and organs, such as the kidneys and heart
These problems are permanent, though early treatment and support can help limit their impact on a child's life.
The type of FASD symptoms a baby has and how severe they are is different depending on how often, and how much, the mother drank during pregnancy. The greater the amount of alcohol consumed, the more severe the symptoms tend to be."
What to do if you think your child has foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),"Speak to a GP or health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's development or think they could have FASD.
If the condition is not diagnosed early and your child does not receive appropriate support, they're more likely to experience bigger challenges associated with the condition.
For example, they may have difficulties with learning, have challenging behaviours, mental health problems, and find it difficult to get a job and live independently as an adult.
A doctor or health visitor will need to know if your child was exposed to alcohol during pregnancy to help make a diagnosis of FASD.
Your child may be referred to a specialist team for an assessment if there's a possibility they have the condition.
This usually involves physical examinations and blood tests to rule out genetic conditions that have similar characteristics to FASD."
Treatment and support for foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),"There is no particular treatment for FASD, and the damage to a child's brain and body cannot be reversed. But an early diagnosis and support can make a big difference.
Once the condition has been diagnosed, a team of healthcare professionals can assess your child's needs and offer appropriate educational and behavioural strategies.
You may also find it helpful to contact a support group for people with FASD. These can be a good source of advice and they may be able to connect you with other people in a similar situation.
Find support from:
FASD Network UK
National Organisation for FASD
You might also want to ask your care team if they know of any local groups in your area."
Preventing foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),"FASD is completely avoidable if you do not drink alcohol while you're pregnant.
The risk of FASD is higher the more you drink. There's no proven ""safe"" level of alcohol in pregnancy. Not drinking at all is the safest approach.
If you're pregnant and struggling with an alcohol problem, talk to a midwife or doctor.
Confidential help and support is also available from:
Drinkaware has a national alcohol helpline called Drinkline; if you're worried about your own or someone else's drinking, call the free helpline on 0300 123 1110 (weekdays 9am to 8pm, weekends 11am to 4pm)
We Are With You – a charity providing free, confidential support for drugs, alcohol and mental health problems, and a directory of drug and alcohol services around the UK
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) – a free self-help group; its ""12-step"" programme involves getting sober with the help of regular support groups

You can also find your nearest alcohol support services or read advice on cutting down your drinking and alcohol in pregnancy."
Check if it's a food allergy,"Symptoms of a food allergy can affect any part of the body, including different parts of the body at the same time.
Common symptoms of a food allergy include:
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
itchy skin or a raised rash (hives)
swelling of the lips, face and eyes (angioedema)
coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, noisy breathing or a hoarse voice
sneezing or an itchy, runny or blocked nose
feeling sick or being sick
tummy pain
diarrhoea
You may get symptoms straight after eating the food you're allergic to, or days later."
Causes of food allergy,"A food allergy is caused by your immune system overreacting to certain types of food.
It's not clear why this happens, but certain foods are more likely to cause an allergic reaction in some people.
The most common allergic foods include:
cows' milk
eggs
peanuts, soybeans, peas and chickpeas
tree nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews, pistachios and Brazil nuts
shellfish, such as prawns, crab and lobster
wheat
But you can be allergic to any type of food, including celery, mustard, sesame seeds and lupin flour found in some baked goods.
You have a slightly higher chance of getting a food allergy if you or a close family member have other allergies, asthma or eczema."
Tests for food allergy,"You may be referred to a specialist for tests if a GP thinks you have a food allergy.
Tests you may have include:
a skin-prick test (where a drop of liquid containing a food you may be allergic to is put on your skin to see if it reacts)
blood tests
a special diet where you avoid eating the food you might be allergic to, to see if your symptoms get better
You may also be asked to keep a food and symptoms diary to help work out what may be triggering your symptoms."
Treatments for a food allergy,"If you have a food allergy, you will not be able to eat the food you're allergic to, including foods where you're allergic to any of the ingredients.
You'll be given medicines to help manage your symptoms or use in case of an emergency.
These include:
antihistamines for mild allergic reactions
emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors, such as an EpiPen, for severe allergic reactions
Your specialist will give you an allergy management plan that will explain how to manage your allergy.
Children with a peanut allergy may have immunotherapy to help their bodies become less sensitive to peanuts, but they should still avoid eating peanuts."
Things you can do if you have a food allergy,"There are steps you can take to help manage your food allergy.
Do
check food labels and restaurant menus carefully to make sure they do not contain the food you're allergic to
tell friends, family, nursery, school and work about your allergy
carry 2 adrenaline auto-injectors with you at all times, if you need them
tell staff at restaurants and cafés about your allergy
tell airlines and cabin staff about your allergy before you fly
wipe down surfaces in public before eating
Don’t
do not eat foods without checking what ingredients are in them first
do not cut foods out of your diet without speaking to a GP"
Food colours linked to hyperactivity,"All food additives, including artificial colours have an E number, which means they've passed safety tests and are approved for use in the EU.
According to research funded by the Food Standards Agency, the 6 food colours most closely linked to hyperactivity in children are:
E102 (tartrazine)
E104 (quinoline yellow)
E110 (sunset yellow FCF)
E122 (carmoisine)
E124 (ponceau 4R)
E129 (allura red)
These colours are used in several foods, including soft drinks, sweets, cakes and ice cream.
Find out more about food additives, including E numbers and hyperactivity, on the Food Standards Agency website"
Should my child avoid these food colours?,"If your child is hyperactive, or has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there's some evidence to suggest that avoiding these 6 food colours may help.
But it's important to be aware that:
hyperactivity can have many different causes, including genetics, and food colours are probably only a small part of the problem
removing food colours from your child's diet will not necessarily lead to an improvement in their behaviour
the link between food colours and hyperactivity is not completely certain; more research is needed to confirm it
you do not need to avoid all E numbers; there are hundreds of different E numbers and most are not linked to hyperactivity
If you think your child's diet may be affecting their behaviour, it might help to keep a diary of what they eat and how their behaviour changes, so you can see any patterns.
If you notice a possible link between food colours and their behaviour, you may want to see if avoiding these colours helps. But do not make changes to your child's diet without getting advice from their GP first."
How to avoid these food colours,"You can avoid food colours linked to hyperactivity by checking food labels and looking for alternative products that do not contain them.
All artificial food colours should be included in the list of ingredients, with either their E number or full name.
If any of the 6 food colours mentioned on this page are included, the label must also have a warning saying the colour ""may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children"".
If you buy food or drink without packaging, you'll need to ask the manufacturer or the person selling the product if it contains artificial colours."
Check if you have a food intolerance,"If you have a food intolerance, you usually get symptoms a few hours after eating the food or ingredient you're intolerant to.
Common symptoms include:
diarrhoea
bloating
farting
tummy pain
But there are lots of other possible symptoms, including headache, feeling tired or exhausted, feeling sick, constipation, joint pain or rashes.
Symptoms can last for a few hours or days."
Causes of a food intolerance,"A food intolerance is caused by your body not being able to digest a certain food or an ingredient in food.
The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance. This is when your body is not able to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products such as cheese and yoghurts.
But you can be intolerant to any type of food or ingredient in food, such as:
gluten (wheat, rye and barley) – found in foods like bread and pasta
histamine – found in foods and drinks like wine and cheese
caffeine – found in coffee, tea and some fizzy drinks
alcohol
sulphites – found in cider, beer and wine
salicylates – found in some fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices
monosodium glutamate (MSG) – found in ripened fruits, cured meats and savoury foods
Unlike a food allergy, a food intolerance is not caused by your immune system overreacting to certain types of food, which means you cannot have a serious allergic reaction."
Tests for food intolerance,"You may be referred to a food and nutrition specialist (dietitian) if a GP thinks you have a food intolerance.
Tests you may have include:
a special diet where you avoid eating the food you might be intolerant to, to see if your symptoms get better – after a few weeks you start eating the food again to see if your symptoms return
blood tests
a breath test if you might be lactose intolerant
You may also be asked to keep a food and symptoms diary to help work out what may be triggering your symptoms.
Important:
Home tests
Some tests you can buy that claim to diagnose food intolerances are not recommended.
There's limited evidence that they give accurate results and they may suggest you should avoid multiple foods, which can be harmful."
Treatment for a food intolerance,"If you have a food intolerance, try to avoid or reduce eating the food you're intolerant to, including foods where you're intolerant to any of the ingredients.
But it's important to not cut foods out of your or your child's diet without the advice of a GP or food and nutrition specialist (dietitian).
This is because you or your child could miss out on certain vitamins and minerals, which are especially important for a child's growth and development."
Check if you have food poisoning,"Symptoms of food poisoning include:
feeling sick (nausea)
diarrhoea
being sick (vomiting)
stomach cramps
a high temperature of 38C or above
feeling generally unwell – such as feeling tired or having aches and chills
The symptoms usually start within a few days of eating the food that caused the infection.
Sometimes they start after a few hours or not for a few weeks.
How to treat food poisoning yourself
You can usually treat yourself or your child at home.
The symptoms usually pass within a week.
The most important thing is to have lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration."
How you get food poisoning,"Food poisoning is caused by eating something that has been contaminated with germs.
This can happen if food:
is not cooked or reheated thoroughly
is not stored correctly – for example, it's not been frozen or chilled
is left out for too long
is handled by someone who's ill or has not washed their hands
is eaten after its ""use by"" date
Any type of food can cause food poisoning.
Read tips to avoid food poisoning"
Causes of foot drop,"The most common cause of foot drop is an injury to a nerve that runs down your leg and controls the muscles that lift your foot.
This can be caused by:
sports injuries
a slipped disc in the spine
crossing your legs, kneeling or squatting for long periods of time
problems with your nerves (peripheral neuropathy) caused by diabetes
hip or knee replacement surgery
not moving for a long time (for example, if you're staying in hospital)
Foot drop can get better on its own and with treatment, but sometimes it can be permanent.
Less common causes of foot drop include:
inherited conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
muscle weakness caused by muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy or motor neurone disease
damage to the brain or spinal cord caused by a stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis"
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have foot drop, a GP will examine your leg and foot, and look at the way you walk.
You may be referred to a specialist for more tests, such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or CT scan, to find out what's causing your dropped foot."
Treatment for foot drop,"How foot drop is treated depends on what's causing it and how long you have had it for.
Sometimes it can get better on its own.
Common treatments for foot drop include:
physiotherapy to strengthen or stretch the muscles in your leg and foot
braces, splints or shoe inserts to help hold the foot in position
a small device that's put in your body and uses electrical signals to help your nerves work (electrical nerve stimulation) – especially if you've had a stroke or have multiple sclerosis
If you have permanent loss of movement from foot drop, you may have surgery to fuse the ankle and foot joints, or repair or graft the nerve."
Things you can do if you have foot drop,"There's a higher risk of tripping and falling if you have a foot drop.
But there are some simple changes you can make to help avoid this.
Do
use a walking aid, such as a stick, if you need one
keep the floors in your home clear
remove things you could trip on in your home, such as loose rugs and electrical cables
keep your house well-lit
install handrails on stairs"
Check if you or your child has a tight foreskin,"The foreskin is the thin layer of skin that covers the end of the penis. If you or your child has a tight foreskin, it will be difficult to pull it back from the end of the penis.
A tight foreskin is normal in babies and young boys. Most boys' foreskins do not pull back (retract) before the age of 5, but sometimes it's not possible until they're 10 or older.
The end of a boy's penis may bulge or balloon when they pee, particularly if their foreskin is tight.
A tight foreskin is not usually a problem, unless there are symptoms such as:
swelling and tenderness
pain when peeing or a weak flow of pee
blood in urine
frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
bleeding or a thick discharge from under the foreskin or an unpleasant smell – these are signs of an infection (balanitis)
painful erections, which can make having sex difficult"
Things you can do if you have a tight foreskin,"If your or your child's foreskin is tight, but is not causing problems like pain or bleeding, there are some things you can do to help ease it and keep the penis clean.
Do
wash your penis regularly – use warm water or warm water and non-perfumed soap
gently pull back your foreskin as far as you can, so you can clean underneath it (adults only)
Don’t
do not pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy because it could be painful and damage it, leading to problems in later life
do not use perfumed soap, talcum powder or deodorants on your penis because they may cause irritation"
Treatments for a tight foreskin,"The foreskins of babies and young boys will usually loosen as they get older, so treatment is often not needed.
If your or your child's foreskin is causing problems, treatments include:
steroid creams or gels (topical steroids) to help soften the foreskin
antibiotics if the foreskin or head of the penis is infected
surgery – removal of the foreskin (circumcision) or a procedure where small cuts are made in the tip of the foreskin so it can be pulled back more easily (usually only suitable for children)"
Complications of a tight foreskin,"Sometimes if the foreskin is very tight it can get stuck and cannot go back to its original position covering the end of the penis. The end of the penis can then become very swollen and painful.
This is known as paraphimosis and it's a medical emergency.
Immediate treatment is needed to avoid serious complications like restricted blood flow to the penis.
A doctor may be able to return the foreskin to its original position. Sometimes surgery to remove the foreskin (circumcision) may be recommended.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child's foreskin is pulled back and cannot go back to its original position over the end of the penis"
When to get medical attention,"If you think you or someone else may have frostbite, call your GP or NHS 111 for advice.
If the symptoms are more severe or there are signs of hypothermia, such as constant shivering or fast breathing (hyperventilation), go immediately to your nearest A&E.
A doctor will examine the affected area, check your vital signs, and ask how you got frostbite.
You may need a follow-up appointment or referral to a specialist, as the full extent of a frostbite injury often isn't apparent until a few days later."
Treating frostbite,"A person with frostbite should be taken to a warm environment as soon as possible. This is to limit the effects of the injury and because it's also likely they'll have hypothermia. Don't put pressure on the affected area.
The frostbitten area should be warmed up by a healthcare professional. This is usually done by immersing the affected area in warm – but not hot – water. 
A bath of water at 37C to 39C (98.6F to 102.2F) is recommended for rewarming. The rewarming process is often painful, and regular strong painkillers may be needed.
It's important not to rewarm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, as this can lead to further tissue damage.
If frostbite is severe, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. Amputation may be needed if frostbite is severe.
Read more about treating frostbite."
What causes frostbite?,"The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down so flow to the vital organs can be increased.
As the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.
The ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.
At-risk groups
Certain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite.
They include:
people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers
anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions
anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers
homeless people
the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature
people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such as diabetes and Raynaud's phenomenon
anyone taking medicine that constricts the blood vessels, including beta blockers – smoking can also constrict the blood vessels
People who've taken drugs or drunk alcohol are also vulnerable to frostbite. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather.
As you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30 to 60 cases every winter."
Preventing frostbite,"Most of the time frostbite can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather.
Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible. 
It's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip.
Wear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as:
well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks
mittens – they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves
a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears – it's important to protect your head from the cold
multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing – these act as insulation
You should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can. 
If you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car in case you break down. 
If you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall.
Be careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold, a common cause of frostbite. Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.
Smoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels."
Complications of frostbite,"If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply. This can make the affected body part very vulnerable to infection because your body relies on white blood cells to ward off infections.
People with frostbite are at risk of bacterial wound infections, such as tetanus. More seriously, this infection can spread into the blood (sepsis), which requires treatment with antibiotics. Both conditions require hospital admission. 
Read more about treating tetanus and treating sepsis.
Hypothermia
Severe frostbite is often associated with hypothermia, which is a dangerous drop in body temperature below 35C (95F).
Initial symptoms can include:
constant shivering
tiredness
low energy
cold or pale skin
fast breathing (hyperventilation)
Someone with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and have shallow breathing and a weak pulse. 
Read more about how hypothermia is treated."
Treatment for frozen shoulder,"Broadly, treatment works in 3 main steps:
Pain relief – avoid movements that cause you pain. Only move your shoulder gently. Use paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain.
Stronger pain and swelling relief – prescribed painkillers. Maybe steroid injections in your shoulder to bring down the swelling.
Getting movement back – shoulder exercises once it's less painful. This can be at home or with a physiotherapist.
You may get a mix of these treatments depending on how painful and stiff your shoulder is.
Stronger pain relief is usually only used for a short time because it can cause side effects."
How long frozen shoulder lasts,"Frozen shoulder can take at least 1.5 to 3 years to get better. Sometimes it can be longer.
But the pain and stiffness will usually go away eventually."
How you can ease pain from frozen shoulder yourself,"Do
follow any exercises from your GP or physiotherapist
move your shoulder – keeping it still will make the pain worse
try heat packs on your shoulder
Don’t
do not make up your own strenuous exercises – for example, gym equipment can make the pain worse"
Causes of frozen shoulder,"It's often not clear why people get a frozen shoulder.
Frozen shoulder happens when the tissue around your shoulder joint becomes inflamed.
The tissue then gets tighter and shrinks, which causes pain.
Frozen shoulder can happen because:
you had an injury or surgery that keeps you from moving your arm normally
you have diabetes – it's still unclear why this is, but it's important to have your regular diabetes check-ups to catch any problems early"
Common medically unexplained symptoms,"Common medically unexplained symptoms include:
pains in the muscles or joints
back pain
headaches
tiredness
feeling faint
chest pain
heart palpitations
stomach problems
About 1 in 4 people who see a GP have physical symptoms that cannot be explained."
Possible causes of medically unexplained symptoms,"Many people with medically unexplained symptoms, such as tiredness, pain and heart palpitations, also have depression or anxiety.
Treating an associated psychological problem can often relieve the physical symptoms.
For others, the symptoms may be part of a poorly understood syndrome, such as:
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) – also known as ME
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
fibromyalgia (pain all over the body)
The fact that doctors are unable to find a condition causing these symptoms isn't unusual in medicine, and it doesn't mean that nothing can be done to help you."
How a GP can help,"A GP will aim to rule out all the possible conditions that might be causing your symptoms. You may have a thorough physical examination and blood tests.
It's important to consider whether any medicine you're taking may be causing your symptoms – for example, taking painkillers long term can lead to headaches.
The GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety. Physical symptoms can cause depression and anxiety, and these can in turn make the physical symptoms worse, creating a vicious circle.
You should tell the GP:
what your symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse
what you think is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of how tests and treatments might help
how your symptoms affect what you can do – what they stop you doing
how upsetting your symptoms are – how they make you feel
There are a number of things you can do yourself that may help.
You and the GP may identify some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help relieve your symptoms, such as regular physical activity and better rest.
You may be referred for a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The aim of CBT is to help you to manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and how you cope.
If your symptoms seem to be caused by a problem with the nervous system, you may be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the nervous system).
The neurologist may refer you for psychotherapy but will also consider other therapy options, such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy .
Medicine such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, medicine isn't always the answer – painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medicine always need to be weighed against the potential side effects.
If you think you have an underlying condition that's been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion."
Self-help,"There are things you can do to improve or even relieve some physical symptoms, such as taking regular exercise and managing stress.
Regular exercise will help keep you fit and many people find that it also boosts their mood (read about exercise for depression). How much exercise you should do will depend on your current health and capabilities.
Managing stress is very important because it's been linked to problems such as pain and IBS. Learn about breathing exercises for stress.
Generally, planning some pleasurable personal time to unwind should help – whatever helps you relax, whether it's yoga classes, swimming, running, meditation or walking in the countryside.

Your body has a remarkable ability to recover and there's a good chance that your symptoms will improve in time, even without any specific treatment."
Check if it's a fungal nail infection,"Fungal nail infections usually affect your toenails, but you can get them on your fingernails, too.
Fungal nail infections sometimes start at the edge of the nail.
Credit:
The infection often spreads to the middle of the nail, making the nail discoloured and sometimes thicker in parts.
Credit:
The nail becomes brittle and pieces can break off. Sometimes the whole nail lifts off. This can cause pain and swelling in the skin around the nail.
Credit:"
A pharmacist can help with fungal nail infections,"Speak to a pharmacist if the look of your nail bothers you or it's painful.
They may suggest:
antifungal nail cream – it can take up to 12 months to cure the infection and does not always work
nail-softening cream – it's used for 2 weeks to soften the nail so the infected part can be scraped off
The infection is cured when you see healthy nail growing back at the base.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for a fungal nail infection from a GP,"A GP can prescribe antifungal tablets. But before they give you tablets they should take a sample of your nail and have it tested, to find out what type of infection you have.
You may need to take antifungal tablets for up to 6 months.
The tablets can have side effects, including:
headaches
itching
loss of taste
feeling sick and diarrhoea
You cannot take antifungal tablets if you're pregnant or have certain conditions. They can damage your liver.
Badly infected nails sometimes need to be removed. It's a small procedure done while the area is numbed (under local anaesthetic)."
Preventing fungal nail infections,"Fungal nail infections develop when your feet are constantly warm and damp.
You're more likely to get an infection if you wear trainers for a long time and have hot, sweaty feet.
To prevent fungal nail infections:
Do
treat athlete's foot as soon as possible to avoid it spreading to nails
keep your feet clean and dry
wear clean socks every day
wear flip-flops in showers at the gym or pool
throw out old shoes
Don’t
do not wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty
do not share towels
do not wear other people's shoes
do not share nail clippers or scissors"
Why does my gallbladder need to be removed?,"Surgery to remove the gallbladder is usually carried out if you have painful gallstones.
These are small stones that can form in the gallbladder as a result of an imbalance in the substances that make up bile.
Gallstones often cause no symptoms and you may not realise you have them, but occasionally they can block the flow of bile and irritate the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis) or pancreas (acute pancreatitis).
This can cause symptoms such as:
sudden and intense tummy pain
feeling and being sick
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
Surgery to remove the gallbladder is the most effective treatment in the vast majority of cases."
What happens during gallbladder removal surgery,"There are 2 main ways of removing a gallbladder:
laparoscopic (keyhole) cholecystectomy – several small cuts (incisions) are made in your tummy (abdomen) and fine surgical instruments are used to access and remove your gallbladder
open cholecystectomy – a single larger incision is made in your tummy to access and remove your gallbladder
Keyhole surgery is used most often because you can leave hospital sooner, recover faster and are left with smaller scars than with an open procedure.
Both techniques are performed under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out.
Find out more about how gallbladder removal surgery is performed"
Recovering from gallbladder removal surgery,"It doesn't usually take long to recover from keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder.
Most people can leave hospital the same day or the next morning.
You'll probably be able to return to most of your normal activities within 2 weeks.
It takes longer to recover from open surgery. You may need to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days and it could be 6 to 8 weeks before you're feeling back to normal.
Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal surgery"
Living without a gallbladder,"You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.
Your liver will still make enough bile to digest your food, but instead of being stored in the gallbladder, it drips continuously into your digestive system.
You may have been advised to eat a special diet before surgery, but this doesn't need to be continued afterwards.
Instead, you should aim to have a generally healthy, balanced diet.
Some people experience problems such as bloating or diarrhoea after surgery, although this usually improves within a few weeks. 
If you notice certain foods or drinks trigger these symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.
Find out more about diet after gallbladder surgery"
Risks of gallbladder removal surgery,"Gallbladder removal surgery is considered to be a safe procedure, but, like any type of surgery, there's a risk of complications.
Possible complications include:
wound infection
bile leaking into the tummy
damage to one of the openings (ducts) carrying bile out of the liver
blood clots
Speak to your surgeon about the benefits and risks of surgery before your operation.
Find out more about the complications of gallbladder removal surgery"
Symptoms of gallstones,"Gallstones often have no symptoms.
But if a gallstone becomes trapped in an opening (duct) inside the gallbladder, it can trigger a sudden, intense pain in your tummy that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours.
This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic.
Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis).
This can cause:
persistent pain
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
a high temperature
When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it's known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis."
The gallbladder,"The gallbladder is a small pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.
Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It's passed from the liver into the gallbladder through a series of channels known as bile ducts.
The bile is stored in the gallbladder and, over time, becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats.
The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed."
Causes of gallstones,"Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder.
In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.
Gallstones are very common. It's estimated more than 1 in every 10 adults in the UK has gallstones, although only a minority of people develop symptoms.
You're more at risk of developing gallstones if you're:
overweight or obese
female (particularly if you have had children)
40 or over (the risk increases as you get older)"
Treating gallstones,"Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing:
symptoms, such as tummy pain
complications, such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis
In these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. 
This procedure, known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is relatively simple to perform and has a low risk of complications.
It's possible to lead a normal life without a gallbladder.
Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than build up in the gallbladder."
Outlook,"Gallstone disease is usually easily treated with surgery. 
Very severe cases can be life threatening, particularly in people who are already in poor health.
But deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK.

Symptoms of a ganglion cyst,"Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth lump under the skin.
They're made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement.
Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common on the wrists (particularly the back of the wrist), hands and fingers.
Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they do not cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years.
It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to happen when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac."
Treatment for a ganglion cyst,"Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint.
The 2 main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are:
draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe (aspiration)
cutting the cyst out using surgery"
Availability on the NHS,"Most integrated care boards (ICBs) do not fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities.
If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment."
Aspiration,"Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital.
Your doctor will use a needle and syringe to remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible.
The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence this reduces the risk of it coming back.
After the procedure, a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin. This can be removed about 6 hours after the procedure.
Aspiration is simple and painless, and you'll be able to leave the hospital straight after.
It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery.
But around half of all ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary."
Surgery,"There are 2 ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst:
open surgery – where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2in) long, over the site of the affected joint or tendon
arthroscopy – a type of keyhole surgery where smaller cuts are made and a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint; using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the cut to remove the cyst
Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you're awake but will not feel any pain, or general anaesthetic, where you're asleep during the operation.
The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer and what your surgeon thinks is best.
Open or keyhole surgery?
Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning.
Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but waiting times are often longer."
After the operation,"The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area.
This helps keep it clean, reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps.
The wound is not usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation.
If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days.
This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible.
Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation.
You'll usually experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly.
There's also a small possibility of temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection treatable with antibiotics.
Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy.
How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on your job and where the ganglion is.
If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off.
You can usually start driving again once it feels safe."
Complications,"Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious.
But a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery.
If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs. 
Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible.
There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist."
Who's affected,"Anyone can develop gangrene, particularly after a serious injury, but there are certain groups of people who are more at risk.
These include people with long-term conditions that can affect the blood vessels, such as:
diabetes – a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high
atherosclerosis – where the arteries become clogged up with a fatty substance called plaque, narrowing them and restricting blood flow
peripheral arterial disease – where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles
Raynaud's – where blood vessels in certain parts of the body, usually the fingers or toes, react abnormally to cold temperatures
Read more about the causes of gangrene."
How gangrene is treated,"The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more successful it's likely to be. The main treatments include surgery to remove damaged tissue, known as debridement, and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection.
In some cases, surgery may be needed to restore blood flow to the affected area.
In more severe cases, it may be necessary to remove an entire body part such as a toe, foot, or lower leg. This is known as amputation.
Read more about treating gangrene."
Preventing gangrene,"Many cases of gangrene can be prevented.
If you have a condition that increases your risk of getting gangrene, such as diabetes, it's important you have regular check-ups to assess the state of your feet. Report any problems to your GP as soon as possible.
Stopping smoking if you smoke and adopting a healthy lifestyle, with a low-fat diet and regular exercise, can also improve your circulation and reduce your risk of developing gangrene.

When a gastrectomy is needed,"A gastrectomy is often used to treat stomach cancer.
Less commonly, it's used to treat:
life-threatening obesity
oesophageal cancer
stomach ulcers (peptic ulcers)
non-cancerous tumours
Gastrectomy is usually an effective treatment for cancer and obesity."
How a gastrectomy is performed,"There are 4 main types of gastrectomy, depending on which part of your stomach needs to be removed:
total gastrectomy – the whole stomach is removed
partial gastrectomy – the lower part of the stomach is removed
sleeve gastrectomy – the left side of the stomach is removed
oesophagogastrectomy – the top part of the stomach and part of the oesophagus (gullet), the tube connecting your throat to your stomach, is removed
The stomach connects to the oesophagus (gullet) and the top of the small intestine
After surgery, you'll still have a working digestive system although it will not function as well as it did before. If all or most of the stomach is removed, the gullet will be connected to the small intestine or the remaining section of the stomach.
All types of gastrectomy are carried out under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation.
Techniques for gastrectomy
2 different techniques can be used to carry out a gastrectomy:
open gastrectomy – where a large cut is made in your stomach or chest
keyhole surgery (laparoscopic gastrectomy) – where several smaller cuts are made and surgical instruments are used
People who have keyhole surgery usually recover faster and have less pain after the procedure than those who have an open gastrectomy. You may also be able to leave hospital a little sooner.
Complication rates after keyhole surgery are similar to those for open gastrectomies.
Open gastrectomies are usually more effective in treating advanced stomach cancer than keyhole surgery is. This is because it's usually easier to remove affected lymph nodes (small glands that are part of the immune system) during an open gastrectomy.
Before you decide which procedure to have, discuss the advantages and disadvantages with your surgeon."
Recovering after a gastrectomy,"A gastrectomy is a major operation, so recovery can take a long time. You'll usually stay in hospital for 1 or 2 weeks after the procedure, where you may receive nutrition directly into a vein until you can eat and drink again.
You'll eventually be able to digest most foods and liquids. However, you may need to make changes to your diet, such as eating frequent small meals instead of 3 large meals a day. You may also need vitamin supplements to ensure you're getting the correct nutrition.
Read more about recovering from a gastrectomy"
Complications,"As with any type of surgery, a gastrectomy carries a risk of complications, such as infection, bleeding and leaking from the area that's been stitched together.
A gastrectomy may also lead to problems, such as anaemia or osteoporosis, caused by a reduction in your ability to absorb vitamins.
Read more about the possible complications of a gastrectomy"
Check if you have gastritis,"Symptoms of gastritis include:
tummy pain
indigestion
feeling full and bloated
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
not feeling as hungry as usual
burping and farting"
Causes of gastritis,"Causes of gastritis include:
infection with a bacteria called helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
taking anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as ibuprofen) and aspirin
drinking too much alcohol
being very stressed and unwell, such as after surgery
Gastritis can also be caused by a problem with your immune system where it attacks the lining of your stomach."
What happens at your GP appointment,"To find out what's causing gastritis symptoms, your doctor might arrange tests such as:
a breath test to check for the bacteria helicobactor pylori (H. pylori); you'll be given a special drink and your breath is checked afterwards
a test on a sample of your poo
a blood test
You should be told how to get ready for a breath test around 4 weeks before it happens."
Treatment for gastritis,"Treatment for gastritis depends on what's causing it.
You might need:
antibiotics
medicines to control stomach acid and stop it from rising into your food pipe (oesophagus), such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors or alginates
to talk to your doctor about stopping anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as ibuprofen) or aspirin and trying a different medicine, if possible
to stop drinking alcohol, if gastritis is caused by alcohol
If it's not treated, gastritis may get worse and cause a stomach ulcer.
If gastritis is not getting better, or it's causing severe symptoms, a GP might refer you to a specialist stomach doctor (gastroenterologist). They might do a test to look inside your stomach, called a gastroscopy."
Things you can do to help gastritis,"If gastritis is causing mild indigestion symptoms, there are things you can do to help.
Do
reduce the amount of drinks you have that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee, cola and energy drinks
lie on an extra pillow in bed so your head and shoulders are higher, to help stop stomach acid rising up your throat while you sleep
lose weight if you're overweight
talk to your doctor if you regularly take anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as ibuprofen) or aspirin
Don’t
do not eat 3 to 4 hours before going to bed
do not have food or drink that's acidic (such as orange juice), fizzy, spicy or fatty
do not drink alcohol
do not smoke
A pharmacist can help with mild indigestion
A pharmacist can recommend:
medicines to help stop stomach acid from irritating your stomach and oesophagus, such as antacids and alginates
medicines that reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes, such as proton pump inhibitors
Some indigestion medicines are taken after eating, and some are taken before eating. Check the information leaflet that comes with the medicine.
Find a pharmacy"
Check if you have acid reflux,"The main symptoms of acid reflux are:
heartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest
an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid
You may also have:
a cough or hiccups that keep coming back
a hoarse voice
bad breath
bloating and feeling sick
Symptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over."
Causes of heartburn and acid reflux,"Lots of people get heartburn from time to time. There's often no obvious reason why.
Sometimes it's caused or made worse by:
certain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods
being overweight
smoking
pregnancy - find out more about indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy
stress and anxiety
an increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen
some medicines, such as anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen)
a hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach moves up into your chest
a stomach ulcer
a bacterial infection in your stomach"
How you can ease heartburn and acid reflux yourself,"Simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn.
Do
eat smaller, more frequent meals
try to lose weight if you're overweight
try to find ways to relax
Don’t
do not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms
do not eat within 3 or 4 hours before bed
do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol
do not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first
You may find that using wood, bricks or books to raise the head of your bed by around 10 to 20cm, so your chest and head are above your waist, helps relieve symptoms. This can help stop stomach acid travelling up towards your throat.
But do not try to achieve the same effect by using additional pillows, as this can increase pressure on your belly and make your symptoms worse.
A pharmacist can help with heartburn and acid reflux
Speak to a pharmacist for advice if you keep getting heartburn.
They may recommend medicines called antacids or alginates that can help ease your symptoms.
It's best to take these with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get heartburn. They may also work for longer if taken with food.
Although antacids and alginates help symptoms in the short term, they will not cure the problem and should not be taken regularly for long periods.
If you're pregnant, a pharmacist can advise you about medicines you can take.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for heartburn and acid reflux from a GP,"If you have acid reflux, a GP may prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces how much acid your stomach makes.
PPIs include:
omeprazole
lansoprazole
You'll usually need to take this type of medicine for 4 or 8 weeks, depending on how serious your acid reflux is.
Go back to the GP if your symptoms return after stopping your medicine. You may need a long-term prescription.
Important
If a PPI does not help, your doctor may suggest trying a different type of medicine called an H2 receptor antagonist, such as famotidine.
Tests and treatments for severe heartburn and acid reflux
If medicines do not help or your symptoms are severe, a GP may refer you to a specialist for:
tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, such as a gastroscopy (where a thin tube with a camera inside it is passed down your throat and into your stomach)
tests to check for bacteria that can cause heartburn – this can be treated with a combination of antibiotics and PPIs
surgery on your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus) to stop acid reflux"
Check if you have gastroparesis,"Symptoms of gastroparesis start after eating and may include:
feeling full sooner than usual – you may be unable to finish meals
feeling sick and being sick
tummy pain
heartburn
bloating
If you've had these symptoms for a while, you may also be losing weight."
Tests for gastroparesis,"If you have symptoms of gastroparesis, you'll usually have blood tests and an X-ray or ultrasound scan of your stomach to rule out other conditions first.
If these tests do not show other causes for your symptoms, you may need:
a gastroscopy (where a thin, flexible tube with a camera inside is passed through your mouth and into your stomach)
tests to find our how long it takes for food to pass through your stomach"
Treatment for gastroparesis,"Diet changes
If you have gastroparesis, you may be recommended to make changes to your diet such as:
eating 4 to 6 small meals a day, rather than 3 large meals
reducing the amount of insoluble fibre you eat – this is a type of fibre that cannot be digested (for example, wholegrain bread, beans, and some vegetables and fruits)
having a liquid diet (for example, foods like soups or meals blended in a food processor)
You may be referred to a healthy eating specialist (a dietitian) to help you make sure you're getting enough nutrients.
Medicines
You may be given medicines for gastroparesis that can:
help food move through your stomach faster, such as metoclopramide or domperidone
stop you feeling sick and being sick
help with pain
If your gastroparesis is linked to diabetes, you may also be offered ways to help you manage your blood sugar levels, such as using an insulin pump.
Other treatments
Depending on your symptoms, you may be offered other treatments including:
a feeding tube if you have malnutrition (a feeding tube can help you get nutrients)
botulinum toxin injections to help relax the valve between your stomach and small intestine
gastro-electrical stimulation, where an electrical device is placed in the abdomen to help your stomach muscles work (this may not be available on the NHS)
surgery where your stomach may be reshaped to help food pass through it more easily"
Causes of gastroparesis,"Gastroparesis is thought to be a problem with the nerves and muscles in the stomach. It's not always known what causes it.
It can be a complication of long-term conditions such as diabetes.
Gastroparesis can also be a complication after some types of surgery."
What is gender identity?,"Gender identity refers to our sense of who we are and how we see and describe ourselves.
Most people identify as ""male"" or ""female"". These are sometimes called ""binary"" identities.
But some people feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex.
For example, some people may have male genitals and facial hair but do not identify as a male or feel masculine.
Some may have female genitals and breasts but do not identify as a female or feel feminine.
Some people do not define themselves as having a ""binary"" identity. For them the concept of gender is not relevant to their identity.
They may use different terms, such as agender, gender diverse, gender non-conforming, to describe their identity. However, as a group, they are often called ""non-binary"".
Gender dysphoria and gender identity
Many people with gender dysphoria have a strong, lasting desire to live a life that ""matches"" or expresses their gender identity. They do this by changing the way they look and behave.
Some people with gender dysphoria, but not all, may want to use hormones and sometimes surgery to express their gender identity.
Gender dysphoria is not a mental illness, but some people may develop mental health problems because of gender dysphoria."
Signs of gender dysphoria,"People with gender dysphoria may have changed their appearance, their behaviour or their interests.
They may also show signs of discomfort or distress, including:
low self-esteem
becoming withdrawn or socially isolated
depression or anxiety
taking unnecessary risks
neglecting themselves
Read more about the signs of gender dysphoria.
Children and gender identity
Children may show an interest in clothes or toys that society tells us are more often associated with the opposite gender. They may be unhappy with their physical sex characteristics.
However, this type of behaviour is reasonably common in childhood and is part of growing up. It does not mean that all children behaving this way have gender dysphoria or other gender identity issues.
A small number of children may feel lasting and severe distress, which gets worse as they get older. This often happens around puberty, when young people might feel that their physical appearance does not match their gender identity.
This feeling can continue into adulthood with some people having a strong desire to change parts of their physical appearance, such as facial hair or breasts.
Find out more information if you think your child might be trans or non-binary."
How to get help,"See a GP if you think you or your child may have gender dysphoria.
If the GP agrees, they can refer you to a gender dysphoria clinic (GDC) where you’ll be assessed by a specialist team.
You do not need to be assessed by a mental health service first, and the GP does not need prior approval from the integrated care boards (ICBs) responsible for local health services.
You can self-refer to a GDC, but a referral by the GP is best. This is because they can give the GDC your detailed medical history.
If you are already seeing a doctor or psychologist for other conditions, ask them if they can refer you to a GDC.
Referrals for children and young people should be sent to the National Referral Support Service for the NHS Children and Young People's Gender Service.
Referrals for adults to one of the gender dysphoria clinics in England may be made from 17 years of age.
Waiting times
As there has been a huge increase in the number of people seeking a referral to a gender dysphoria clinic, waiting times can be long.
Find out how your GP and other organisations can support you while you wait to see a GDC."
Treatment for gender dysphoria,"After a detailed assessment to confirm the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and what it means for you, the GDC team will work with you on an agreed treatment plan.
If you are assessed as not having gender dysphoria, the GDC may recommend other forms of support to your GP.
Treatments provided by the GDC are intended to provide lasting relief from gender dysphoria. This can mean different things to different people.
For some people, treatment may just involve acceptance and affirmation or confirmation of their identity. For others, it may involve bigger changes, such as changes to their voice, hormone treatment or surgery.
Read more about treatments for gender dysphoria."
What causes gender dysphoria?,"The exact cause of gender dysphoria is unclear.
Gender development is complex and there are still things that are not known or fully understood.
Gender dysphoria is not related to sexual orientation. People with gender dysphoria may identify as straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual."
How common is gender dysphoria?,"No one really knows because not all people who have a sense of unease about their identity, or already identify as gender diverse, need or ask for support from the NHS.
The number of people being referred and diagnosed with the condition has increased a lot over the last decade. In 2018/19 around 8,000 people were referred to adult gender dysphoria services in England."
How general anaesthetics are given,"Before having an operation, you'll meet a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist to discuss which anaesthetic is most suitable for you.
This is called a preoperative assessment, when the anaesthetist will:
discuss the type or types of anaesthetic that are suitable for you
explain the risks of anaesthesia
agree a plan with you for your anaesthetic and pain control afterwards
The anaesthetist will look at your medical history and ask whether anyone in your family has had problems with anaesthesia. They'll also ask about your general health and lifestyle, including whether you:
have any allergies
smoke or drink alcohol
are taking any other medicine
The anaesthetist can answer any questions you have. Let them know if you're unsure about any part of the procedure or if you have any concerns. You should be given clear instructions to follow before the operation, including whether you can eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to it.
Before and during your operation
Just before you have surgery, you'll usually be taken to a room where your anaesthetist will give you the general anaesthetic. 
It will either be given as a:
liquid that's injected into your veins through a cannula (a thin, plastic tube that feeds into a vein, usually on the back of your hand)
gas that you breathe in through a mask
The anaesthetic should take effect very quickly. You'll start feeling lightheaded, before becoming unconscious within a minute or so.
The anaesthetist will stay with you throughout the procedure. They'll make sure you continue to receive the anaesthetic and that you stay in a controlled state of unconsciousness. They'll also give you painkilling medicine into your veins, so that you're comfortable when you wake up.
Recovery
After your operation, the anaesthetist will stop the anaesthetic and you'll gradually wake up. You'll usually be in a recovery room at first, before being transferred to a ward.
Depending on your circumstances, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few hours to a few days after your operation.
General anaesthetics can affect your memory, concentration and reflexes for a day or two, so it's important for a responsible adult to stay with you for at least 24 hours after your operation, if you're allowed to go home. You'll also be advised to avoid driving, drinking alcohol and signing any legal documents for 24 to 48 hours."
Side effects,"General anaesthetics have some common side effects. Your anaesthetist should discuss these with you before your surgery.
Most side effects happen immediately after your operation and do not last long. Possible side effects include:
feeling sick or being sick (vomiting) – this usually happens immediately, although some people may continue to feel sick for up to a day
shivering and feeling cold – this may last a few minutes or hours
confusion and memory loss – this is more common in older people or those with existing memory problems; it's usually temporary, but occasionally can be longer lasting
bladder problems – you may have difficulty passing urine
dizziness – you will be given fluids to treat this
bruising and soreness – this may develop in the area where you were injected or had a drip fitted; it usually heals without treatment
sore throat – during your operation, a tube may be inserted either into your mouth or down your throat to help you breathe; afterwards, this can cause a sore throat
damage to the mouth or teeth – a small proportion of people may have small cuts to their lips or tongue from the tube, and some may have damage to their teeth; you should tell your anaesthetist about any dental work you have had done"
Complications and risks,"A number of more serious complications are associated with general anaesthetics, but these are rare.
Possible serious complications and risks include:
a serious allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (anaphylaxis)
waking up during your operation (accidental awareness), although the amount of anaesthetic given will be continuously monitored to help ensure this does not happen
death – this is very rare
Serious problems are more likely if you're having major or emergency surgery, you have any other illnesses, you smoke, or you're overweight.
Your anaesthetist will discuss the risks with you before your operation. You should try to stop smoking or drinking alcohol in the weeks before surgery, as doing so will reduce your risk of developing complications.
You may also be advised to lose weight and increase your activity levels in the weeks before surgery, if you can. Doing this could reduce any possible risks or complications. 
In most cases, the benefits of being pain-free during an operation outweigh the risks."
Other types of anaesthetic,"As well as general anaesthetic, there are several other types of anaesthetic, which can be used for certain procedures. They include:
local anaesthetic
epidural anaesthetic
spinal anaesthetic
nerve blocks"
Why would I be offered a genetic test?,"mic testing – finds changes in genes that can cause health problems. It's mainly used to diagnose rare and inherited health conditions and some cancers.
Why would I be offered a genetic test?
You may be offered a genetic test because:
your doctor thinks you might have a health condition caused by a change to 1 or more of your genes
someone in your family has a health condition that's caused by changes to genes
some of your close relatives have had a particular type of cancer that could be inherited
you or your partner have a health condition that could be passed on to your children
If you have any questions, talk to your doctor about having a genetic test.
What a genetic test can tell me
A genetic test can:
help to diagnose a rare health condition in a child
help you understand whether an inherited health condition may affect you, your child or another family member, and help you decide whether to have children
show if you are at higher risk of getting certain health conditions, including some types of cancer
guide doctors in deciding what medicine or treatment to give you
guide doctors on whether you're able to join a clinical trial
Information:
The NHS is introducing whole genome sequencing through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service.
Whole genome sequencing looks at all your genetic material at the same time (not just part of it, as with other types of genetic test).
Who can have a genetic test on the NHS?
You need to be referred for genetic testing by a doctor.
Talk to your hospital specialist about whether testing is right for you.
Is genetic testing free on the NHS?
Genetic testing is free on the NHS if you are referred for it by a hospital specialist.
You will generally only be referred if you have a suspected genetic health condition or if you have a particular type of cancer.
Genetic counselling
If you're offered a genetic test, you may be referred to a genetic counsellor to help you think through what the test means for you and your family.
A genetic counsellor can help you understand:
the risks and benefits of you having a genetic test
the potential results of your test and what they mean
how your family members may be affected if the test shows a serious health condition runs in your family
the risk of you and your partner passing on a health condition to your children
your options if you have a child with an inherited health condition and you do not want your next child to inherit it
A genetic counsellor can also direct you to relevant patient support groups.
The British Society for Genetic Medicine has a list of organisations that offer information and support.
The charity Genetic Alliance UK has more information about making the decision to have predictive testing.
If you decide not to have a genetic test, you will still receive care and support from healthcare professionals.
The impact on your family
You may want to consider how the results of a genetic test may affect you and others in your family.
If the genetic test shows there are changes to your genes that cause a health condition, this may mean that other members of your family also have it. In this situation, your doctor may recommend that other members of your family also have a genetic test.
There's also a chance that the test gives you information about your relatives that you or they may not have known before. For example, it may show that you were adopted or that your biological father is not who you thought they were.
This is because the test can show that you do not share genes with your family members.
Find out more information from Genetic Alliance UK about the risks and benefits of genetic testing.
Having a genetic test
A genetic test is usually done using a sample of your blood or saliva.
If you've been referred for a genetic test because you have cancer, the test will be done on a sample of the tumour that has already been removed as part of your treatment.
The sample of blood, saliva or body tissue is sent to a genetic testing laboratory to be analysed.
Getting the results
You'll be told when to expect the results of your test. Depending on the reason for your test, it could be weeks or months. You may need further tests.
The results from the test may show:
you have a change in your genes which is known to cause a health condition
you do not have a change in your genes which is known to cause a health condition
it's not clear what the results mean for your health (but doctors may have a better understanding of the results in the future)
After you get your results, you may be referred to a genetic counsellor to help you understand what they mean for you and your family.
Will it affect my insurance?
When applying for some types of insurance policies, an insurance company may ask you to provide medical information about you and your family.
You will have to disclose a health condition that has been diagnosed by genetic testing, but you will not usually have to disclose the results of predictive genetic testing – that is testing to show if you're more likely than other people to get a certain health condition in the future.
The information that you need to share with an insurance company is regulated by a voluntary government code agreed with the Association of British Insurers called the Code on Genetic Testing and Insurance.
The NHS will not give your genetic test results to an insurance company without your consent.
How your data will be used
Your genetic data includes your sample (blood, tissue or saliva), clinical information about your health condition and the results of your test.
This data may be used in:
your individual care
planning to improve the health services you and others receive
research
The data from your genetic test is stored locally. Data from whole genome sequencing is stored in a secure national database. Where necessary, information that can identify you, such as your name and address, is removed. Your data can only be accessed by approved staff.
If you have a genetic test (including whole genome sequencing) on the NHS, it's not possible to stop your data being stored and shared. If you have already opted out of data from your health records being shared, this does not apply to your genetic test data.
Find out more from NHS England about what data about you has been stored and how it is used.
The NHS is responsible for your genetic data. Find out more from NHS England about the NHS's responsibility as a data controller.
Find out more about how the NHS manages your data in the NHS England Privacy Notice."
What to do if you're worried ,"Speak to a GP if cancer runs in your family and you're worried you may get it too. They may refer you to a local genetics service for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer risk genes. 
This type of testing is known as predictive genetic testing. It's ""predictive"" because a positive result means you have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. It does not mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it.
You may be eligible for this NHS test if the faulty gene has already been identified in one of your relatives, or if there is a strong family history of cancer in your family.
You can also have NHS genetic testing for faulty BRCA genes if you’re 18 years or older and have 1 or more Jewish grandparent. This is because having Jewish ancestry increases your risk of having a faulty BRCA gene.
Find out more about the NHS Jewish BRCA testing programme."
Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test ,"Not everyone who is eligible for the NHS test will want to have it. It's a personal decision, and should only be made after you've had genetic counselling and talked through what having the test means, how you may feel and how you will cope.
Advantages
A positive result means you can take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer.
You can make certain lifestyle changes to lower your risk, have regular screening and have preventative treatment.
Knowing the result may reduce any stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing.
Disadvantages
The results of some genetic tests are inconclusive. This means doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have.
A positive result may cause permanent anxiety. Some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer."
What testing involves  ,"There are usually 2 steps to genetic testing:
A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready 6 to 8 weeks later.
If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to a local genetics service for a blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will usually take up to 2 - 4 weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is very likely to find the faulty gene but on rare occasions it may miss it.
When there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a faulty gene. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It can take 4 to 8 weeks or longer to get the result."
What a positive result means ,"If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer.
It does not mean you are guaranteed to get cancer – your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role.
If you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it.
You may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. Staff at the genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family.
You can read more about BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.
Insurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future."
Managing your risk  ,"If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option.
Ultimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do – it's a decision only you can make.
Regularly examining your breasts
If you have the faulty BRCA1/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Find out more about being breast cancer aware.
This advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent).
Screening
In the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop.
Detecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer.
Unfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene.
Lifestyle changes
Changes in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet.
If you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid:
the oral contraceptive pill 
drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol
being overweight
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible.
Find out more about things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.
Medicine (chemoprevention)
NICE recommends medicines called tamoxifen, raloxifene and anastrozole for some women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer.
These can reduce your risk of getting breast cancer for many years.
Find out more about medicine to prevent breast cancer.
Risk-reducing surgery
Risk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.  
Women who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 50%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult.
Surgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their chances of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their chances of developing breast cancer by up to 50%.
However, this will trigger early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos).
If you have not had breast cancer, you’ll be offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT) until you’re about 50 years old. This is to protect against heart disease and thinning of your bones. If you have had breast cancer, you will not be offered HRT.
Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects.
The risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation."
Telling close relatives  ,"Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result – it will usually be up to you to tell your family.
You may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves.
However, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing."
Planning a family ,"Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can:
have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene
adopt a baby
use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene
discuss prenatal testing with your doctor – but testing an unborn baby for genes that may cause cancer in later life, using CVS or amniocentesis, is not routinely offered
have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene; but there's no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and NHS funding for it may not be available to all patients"
Paying for private testing,"If there is not a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene has not otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you will not be eligible for the NHS genetic test.
You'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because:
if you do not have any family history of cancer, it's less likely you have one of the faulty genes
the tests can be expensive, potentially costing around £1,000 or more
there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer
you may not be offered genetic counselling to help you make a decision and support you once you get your results"
About BRCA1 and BRCA2,"If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.  
For example, most women in the UK have a 1 in 7 (15%) chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime.
Out of every 100 women who have a BRCA1 gene mutation:
65 to 85 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime (65 to 85% lifetime risk)
40 to 63 will develop ovarian cancer (40 to 63% lifetime risk)
Out of every 100 women who have a BRCA2 gene mutation:
40 to 85 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime (40 to 85% lifetime risk)
10 to 27 will develop ovarian cancer (10 to 27% lifetime risk)
Women with BRCA mutations are also at increased risk of developing breast cancer at a younger age.
Men with BRCA mutations have an increased risk of getting prostate, breast or pancreatic cancer.
For example, 12 or 13 men in every 100 will get prostate cancer before the age of 80. But out of every 100 men who have the BRCA2 gene mutation, 20 will develop prostate cancer.
The faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 400 people. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (1 in 40 carry a faulty gene), and people of Sephardi Jewish descent are also at higher risk (around 1 in 140 have a faulty gene).
For more information, read The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust beginners guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 on their website."
Check if you have genital herpes,"Symptoms of genital herpes include:
small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, anus, thighs or bottom – the sores may be less red on brown or black skin
tingling, burning or itching around your genitals
pain when you pee
discharge that is not usual for you
Where genital herpes symptoms appear and what they look like"
What happens at a sexual health clinic,"The doctor or nurse at the sexual health clinic will:
ask about your symptoms and your sexual partners
use a small cotton bud (swab) to take some fluid from 1 of your blisters or sores for testing
The test cannot:
be done if you do not have visible blisters or sores
tell you how long you've had herpes or who you got it from
Symptoms might not appear for weeks or even years after you're infected with the herpes virus."
Treatment for genital herpes,"There's no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms clear up by themselves, but the blisters can come back (an outbreak or recurrence).
Treatment from a sexual health clinic can help.
Treatment the first time you have genital herpes
You may be prescribed:
antiviral medicine to stop the symptoms getting worse – you need to start taking this within 5 days of the symptoms appearing
cream for the pain
If you've had symptoms for more than 5 days before you go to a sexual health clinic, you can still get tested to find out the cause.
Treatment if the blisters come back
Go to a GP or sexual health clinic if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and need treatment for an outbreak.
Antiviral medicine may help shorten an outbreak by 1 or 2 days if you start taking it as soon as symptoms appear.
But outbreaks usually settle by themselves, so you may not need treatment.
Recurrent outbreaks are usually milder than the first episode of genital herpes.
Over time, outbreaks tend to happen less often and be less severe. Some people never have outbreaks.
Some people who have more than 6 outbreaks in a year may benefit from taking antiviral medicine for 6 to 12 months.
If you still have outbreaks of genital herpes during this time, you may be referred to a specialist."
How to deal with outbreaks yourself,"There are things you can do if you've been diagnosed with genital herpes and you're having an outbreak.
Do
keep the area clean using plain or salt water to prevent blisters becoming infected
apply an ice pack wrapped in a flannel to soothe pain
apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) or painkilling cream (such as 5% lidocaine) to reduce pain when you pee
wash your hands before and after applying cream or jelly
pee while pouring water over your genitals to ease the pain
Don’t
do not wear tight clothing that may irritate blisters or sores
do not put ice directly on the skin
do not touch your blisters or sores unless you're applying cream
do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the sores have gone away"
How genital herpes is passed on,"Genital herpes is very easy to pass on (contagious) from the first tingling or itching of a new outbreak (before any blisters appear) to when sores have fully healed.
You may also be able to pass on the virus even if you do not have any symptoms.
You can get genital herpes:
from skin-to-skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex)
when there are no visible sores or blisters
if a cold sore touches your genitals
by transferring the infection on fingers from someone else to your genitals
by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes
You cannot get genital herpes:
from objects such as cutlery or cups – the virus dies very quickly when away from your skin"
Protecting against genital herpes,"You can reduce the chances of passing on genital herpes by:
using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but herpes can still be passed on if the condom does not cover the infected area
avoiding vaginal, anal or oral sex if you or your partner has blisters or sores, or a tingle or itch that means an outbreak is coming
not sharing sex toys – if you do, wash them and put a condom on them"
Genital herpes and HIV,"Genital herpes can be a more serious condition for people with HIV.
If you have HIV and herpes, you'll be referred to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) specialist."
Genital herpes and pregnancy,"Women who have had genital herpes before pregnancy can usually expect to have a healthy baby and a vaginal delivery.
However, if you have genital herpes during pregnancy, there's a risk your baby could develop a serious illness called neonatal herpes.
This can be fatal, but most babies recover with antiviral treatment.
The risk of your baby getting neonatal herpes is low if you've had genital herpes before.
It's higher if you get genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy.
Important
See your midwife or a GP if you think you have genital herpes in pregnancy.
Genital herpes treatment in pregnancy
You may be offered antiviral treatment:
to treat outbreaks in pregnancy
from week 36 of pregnancy to reduce the chance of an outbreak during birth
from diagnosis until the birth if you first get herpes after week 28 of pregnancy
Many women with genital herpes have a vaginal delivery. You may be offered a caesarean, depending on your circumstances."
Check if you have genital warts,"It can take a few weeks or months for genital warts to appear after having sex with someone who is infected.
Genital warts are usually small, rough lumps on the skin.
They can appear:
around the vagina and on the penis
around the anus
on the skin between the genitals and anus (perineum)
Genital warts may:
appear on their own or in a group (groups of warts can look like a cauliflower)
feel soft or firm
be white, red, skin-coloured, or darker than the surrounding skin
They do not usually cause symptoms but sometimes they may be painful, itchy or bleed.
You may also have:
pain or discomfort during sex
problems peeing (there may be blood in your pee, you may find it hard to pee, or you may stop and start a lot)"
What happens at a sexual health clinic,"A doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic will usually be able to diagnose genital warts by looking at them.
They may:
ask you about your symptoms and sexual partners
look at the lumps around your genitals and anus, sometimes using a magnifying lens
possibly need to look inside your vagina, anus or urethra (tube where pee comes out), depending on where the warts are
It may not be possible to find out who you got genital warts from, or how long you've had the infection."
Treatments for genital warts,"Treatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months.
If treatment is recommended, it will need to be prescribed by a doctor.
The type of treatment you'll be offered depends on what the warts look like and where they are. The doctor or nurse will discuss this with you.
Treatments for genital warts include:
cream, liquid or ointment – you can usually apply these yourself, but if the area is large, a doctor or nurse will need to apply it (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or a burning sensation)
freezing (cryotherapy) – this treatment may need to be repeated several times and can be painful
surgery – the warts are cut out after numbing the affected area with local anaesthetic, or they may be removed using heat or a laser (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or scarring)
It may take weeks or months for genital wart treatment to work and the warts may come back. Sometimes the treatment does not work.
Tell the doctor or nurse if you're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, as some treatments will not be suitable for you.
Some creams can weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms if it comes into contact with them. Ask the doctor or nurse about this."
Things you can do while having treatment for genital warts,"There are some things you can do while having treatment for genital warts.
Do
follow the instructions about how to apply creams, liquids and ointments carefully – some creams should only be left on for a certain amount of time before being washed off
avoid getting any treatment you apply to genital warts on normal skin or in open wounds
Don’t
do not use wart treatment from a pharmacy because they're not made for genital warts
do not smoke – many treatments for genital warts work better if you do not smoke
do not have vaginal, anal or oral sex until the warts have gone (but if you do have sex, always use a condom)"
How genital warts are passed on,"Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus can be passed on even when there are no visible warts.
Many people with the virus do not have symptoms but can still pass it on.
If you have genital warts, your current sexual partners should consider getting checked because they may have warts and not know it.
After you get the infection, it can take weeks to many months before symptoms appear.
You can get genital warts from:
skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal and anal sex
sharing sex toys
oral sex, but this is rare
The virus can also be passed to a baby from its mother during birth, but this is rare.
Genital warts can be spread if you touch an infected area and then touch another part of your body.
You cannot get genital warts from kissing or from sharing things like towels, cutlery, cups or toilet seats."
Stopping genital warts being passed on,"You can stop genital warts being passed on by:
using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but if the virus is in any skin that's not protected by a condom, it can still be passed on
not having sex while you're having treatment for genital warts
not sharing sex toys – if you do share them, wash them or cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them
HPV vaccine
The HPV vaccine offered to 12 to 13 year-old girls and boys in England protects against genital warts and some cancers (such as cervical cancer and anal cancer).
The HPV vaccine is also offered to men (up to and including 45 years old) who have sex with men, some trans men and trans women, sex workers and people living with HIV."
Genital warts and pregnancy,"Genital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy.
But you'll usually be referred to a sexual health specialist if you have genital warts and you’re pregnant.
During pregnancy, genital warts may:
multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they're very big)
become more easily irritated
be passed on to the baby during birth, but this is rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby’s throat or genitals)
Most creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy.
Genital warts often disappear on their own within 6 weeks after the baby is born, so treatment is often delayed until after the birth."
Check if you or your child have rubella,"The main symptom of rubella is a spotty rash that starts on the face or behind the ears and spreads to the neck and body.
The rash takes 2 to 3 weeks to appear after getting rubella.
The rash looks red or pink on white skin.
Credit:
It can be harder to see on brown or black skin, but might feel rough or bumpy.
Credit:
You might also have lumps (swollen glands) in your neck or behind your ears.
Credit:
Rubella can also cause:
aching fingers, wrists or knees
a high temperature
coughs
sneezing and a runny nose
headaches
a sore throat
sore, red eyes"
How to look after yourself or your child,"Rubella usually gets better in about a week.
After getting advice from a GP, you or your child should:
get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids, like water or squash
take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you're uncomfortable – do not give aspirin to children under 16"
How to avoid spreading rubella,"Rubella spreads in coughs and sneezes.
It’s infectious from 1 week before the symptoms start and for 5 days after the rash first appears.
It can be serious for some people, so you should try to avoid spreading it to others.
Do
stay off nursery, school, or work for 5 days after the rash appears
try to avoid close contact with anyone who is pregnant
wash your hands often with soap and warm water
use tissues when you cough or sneeze
throw used tissues in the bin
Don’t
do not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding"
Rubella in pregnancy,"Rubella is very rare in pregnancy. But if you get it when you're pregnant, rubella could harm your baby.
It can cause:
loss of the baby (miscarriage)
serious problems after the baby is born – such as problems with their sight, hearing, heart, or brain
The risk is highest if you get rubella early in pregnancy.
There's not thought to be a risk to your baby if you get rubella after week 20 of your pregnancy.
Urgent advice:
Call your midwife, maternity unit, or GP immediately if:
You're pregnant and either:
you have a new rash
you’ve been in close contact with someone who has rubella"
Get vaccinated against rubella,"The MMR vaccine can prevent rubella. It also protects you from measles and mumps.
The MMR vaccine is offered to all children in the UK. 2 doses can give lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella.
Ask at your GP surgery if you're not sure you or your child have had the vaccine. They can give it for free on the NHS."
Symptoms of temporal arteritis,"The symptoms of temporal arteritis depend on which arteries are affected.
The main symptoms are:
frequent, severe headaches
pain or tenderness at the side of your head (temples) or on the scalp
jaw pain while eating or talking
vision problems, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes
More general symptoms are also common – for example, flu-like symptoms, unintentional weight loss, depression and tiredness.
Some people with temporal arteritis also develop polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips."
Tests for temporal arteritis,"If you see a GP about temporal arteritis, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine your temples.
After having some blood tests, you'll be referred to a specialist.
They may carry out further tests to help diagnose temporal arteritis.
You may have:
an ultrasound scan of your temples
a biopsy under local anaesthetic – where a small piece of the temporal artery is removed and checked for signs of temporal arteritis
If you have problems with your vision, you should have a same-day appointment with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) at a hospital eye department."
Treatment for temporal arteritis,"Temporal arteritis is treated with steroid medicine, usually prednisolone.
Treatment will be started before temporal arteritis is confirmed because of the risk of vision loss if it's not dealt with quickly.
There are 2 stages of treatment:
An initial high dose of steroids for a few weeks to help bring your symptoms under control.
A lower steroid dose (after your symptoms have improved) given over a longer period of time, possibly several years.
A small number of people may need to take steroids for the rest of their life.
You'll have regular follow-ups to see how you're doing and check for any side effects you may have.
Important:
Steroids
Do not suddenly stop taking steroids unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine could make you very ill.
Other treatments
You may also need to take other types of medicine if you have temporal arteritis, including: :
low-dose aspirin – to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack, which can happen if the arteries to your heart are affected
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – to lower your risk of getting a stomach problem like indigestion or a stomach ulcer, which can be a side effect of taking prednisolone
bisphosphonate therapy – to reduce the risk of osteoporosis when taking prednisolone
immunosuppressants – to allow steroid medicine to be reduced and help prevent temporal arteritis coming back"
How giardiasis is spread,"You can get giardiasis through direct contact with infected people or animals, or from swallowing contaminated water, food or drinks.
There are lots of ways you can catch it, such as:
drinking water that's contaminated by the poo of infected people or animals
eating food that's been washed in contaminated water or handled by someone with giardiasis
water getting in your mouth while swimming in places like lakes, rivers or swimming pools
touching surfaces that have been touched by an infected person
having sex with someone infected with giardiasis – especially unprotected anal and oral sex"
Symptoms of giardiasis,"The main symptoms of giardiasis are:
smelly diarrhoea
tummy pain or cramps
farting (flatulence)
smelly burps – they may smell like eggs
bloating
weight loss
You can have giardiasis and spread it to others without having any symptoms."
Treatment for giardiasis,"A GP may send off a sample of your poo for tests to check if you have giardiasis.
It's treated with antibiotics. Your symptoms should stop in about a week, but they can sometimes last longer.
Sometimes the people you live with may also need to be tested and treated.
Important
Go back to a GP if you still have symptoms a week after starting treatment.
They might give you more antibiotics or refer you to a specialist for treatment."
How to avoid spreading giardiasis,"There are things you can do if you have giardiasis to avoid spreading it.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water frequently
separate clothing and bedding that may be contaminated from other laundry and wash it on a hot wash
clean toilet seats, flush handles, taps, surfaces and door handles regularly
Don’t
do not prepare food for other people, if possible
do not share towels, wash cloths, flannels, cutlery and utensils
do not use a swimming pool until 2 weeks after your symptoms stop
Important
You're most infectious from when your symptoms start until 2 days after they have passed. Stay off school or work until your symptoms have stopped for 2 days."
How to look after yourself if you have giardiasis,"To look after yourself while you have giardiasis:
drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration, such as water and squash – if you're well hydrated, your pee should be light yellow or clear
do not drink alcohol while you're taking antibiotics – alcohol can react with the main antibiotics used to treat giardiasis
If your baby has giardiasis, give them breast or bottle feeds as usual.
A pharmacist can help if you're dehydrated
Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.
They may recommend using sachets that you mix with water to help you stay hydrated, called oral rehydration solutions.
Find a pharmacy"
Symptoms of Gilbert's syndrome,"Most people with Gilbert's syndrome have occasional and short-lived episodes of yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). It's caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood.
Jaundice may be less obvious if you have brown or black skin, but you may notice the white part of your eyes looks yellow.
As Gilbert's syndrome usually only causes a slight increase in bilirubin levels, the yellowing of jaundice is often mild. The eyes are usually affected most.
Around 1 in 3 people with Gilbert's syndrome do not experience any symptoms at all.
You may not realise you have Gilbert's syndrome until tests for an unrelated problem are carried out."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have an episode of jaundice for the first time.
The jaundice of Gilbert's syndrome is usually mild, but jaundice can be associated with more serious liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C.
It's important to get immediate medical advice from a GP if you have jaundice. If you cannot get in touch with a GP, call NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice.
If you have been diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome, you do not usually need to get medical advice during an episode of jaundice, unless you have additional or unusual symptoms."
Causes of Gilbert's syndrome,"Gilbert's syndrome is a genetic condition that runs in families.
People with the syndrome have a faulty gene, which causes the liver to have problems removing bilirubin from the blood.
Normally, when red blood cells reach the end of their life (after about 120 days), haemoglobin, the red pigment that carries oxygen in the blood, breaks down into bilirubin.
The liver converts bilirubin into a water-soluble form, which passes into bile (a fluid produced by the liver to help with digestion) and is eventually removed from the body in pee or poo.
In Gilbert's syndrome, the faulty gene means bilirubin is not passed into bile at the normal rate. Instead, it builds up in the bloodstream, giving the skin and whites of the eyes a yellowish tinge.
Other than inheriting the faulty gene, there are no known risk factors for developing Gilbert's syndrome. It's not related to lifestyle habits, environmental factors or serious underlying liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C."
Triggers of jaundice episodes,"People with Gilbert's syndrome often find there are certain triggers that can bring on an episode of jaundice.
Episodes are often linked to things that can cause physical or mental stress including:
being dehydrated
going without food for long periods of time (fasting)
drinking too much alcohol (keep within the recommended weekly units of alcohol)
being ill with an infection
heavy physical exertion
not getting enough sleep
having surgery
having a period
Where possible, avoiding known triggers can reduce your chance of having episodes of jaundice."
Who's affected,"Gilbert's syndrome is common, but it's difficult to know exactly how many people are affected because it does not always cause obvious symptoms.
In the UK, it's thought at least 1 in 20 people (probably more) are affected by Gilbert's syndrome. It's more common in people with type 1 diabetes.
Gilbert's syndrome affects more men than women. It's usually diagnosed in a person's late teens or early 20s."
Diagnosing Gilbert's syndrome,"Gilbert's syndrome can be diagnosed using a blood test to measure the levels of bilirubin in your blood and a liver function test.
When the liver is damaged, it releases enzymes into the blood. At the same time, levels of proteins that the liver produces to keep the body healthy begin to drop.
By measuring the levels of these enzymes and proteins, it's possible to build up a reasonably accurate picture of how well the liver is functioning.
If the test results show you have high levels of bilirubin in your blood, but your liver is otherwise working normally, a confident diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can usually be made.
Sometimes, a genetic test may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome."
Living with Gilbert's syndrome,"Gilbert's syndrome is a lifelong condition. But it does not require treatment because it does not pose a threat to health and does not cause complications or an increased risk of liver disease.
Episodes of jaundice and any associated symptoms are usually short-lived and eventually pass.
Changing your diet or the amount of exercise you do will not affect whether you have the condition.
But it's still important to make sure you eat a healthy, balanced diet and get plenty of exercise.
You may find it useful to avoid the things you know trigger episodes of jaundice, such as dehydration and stress.
If you have Gilbert's syndrome, the problem with your liver may also mean you're at risk of developing jaundice or other side effects after taking certain medicines, such as medicines for high cholesterol like statins.
You should talk to a GP before taking any new medicine and make sure you mention that you have Gilbert's syndrome to any doctors treating you for the first time."
Check if it's glandular fever,"Glandular fever is most common in people aged 15 to 24 years old.
Symptoms of glandular fever may include:
high temperature
swollen glands, which may be in the neck, head, armpits, elbows, or groin
sore throat
a rash, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin
headache
tiredness"
How to treat glandular fever yourself,"Glandular fever should get better by itself, and you should start to feel better within 2 to 4 weeks.
There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms.
Do

How to stop glandular fever spreading,"Glandular fever is spread through spit, so you can get it through kissing or by sharing cups or cutlery.
You're infectious for up to 7 weeks before you get symptoms, and you may be infectious for several months after being unwell.
You can go back to work or school as soon as you start to feel better.
To prevent glandular fever spreading:
Do
wash your hands regularly
wash anything that may have your spit on it
Don’t
do not kiss others
do not share cups or cutlery
do not give blood"
What happens at your GP appointment,"A GP may order a blood test to confirm if you have glandular fever and to rule out other illnesses, like tonsillitis. The blood test will test for the Epstein-Barr virus, which usually causes glandular fever.
The GP will not give you antibiotics. Glandular fever is caused by a virus so antibiotics will not work."
Glandular fever complications,"Most people get better with no problems. But sometimes glandular fever may lead to other problems like:
liver conditions, such as hepatitis
heart problems, such as inflammation of the heart
kidney problems
blood conditions, such as low levels of blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia) or sepsis
neurological conditions, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or Bell's palsy
a ruptured (burst) spleen
long-term tiredness (chronic fatigue) which may last for several months"
Symptoms of glaucoma,"Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with.
It tends to develop slowly over many years and affects the edges of your vision (peripheral vision) first.
For this reason, many people do not realise they have glaucoma, and it's often only picked up during a routine eye test.
If you do notice any symptoms, they might include blurred vision, or seeing rainbow-coloured circles around bright lights.
Both eyes are usually affected, although it may be worse in 1 eye.
Very occasionally, glaucoma can develop suddenly and cause:
intense eye pain
nausea and vomiting
a red eye
a headache
tenderness around the eyes
seeing rings around lights
blurred vision"
When to get medical advice,"Visit an opticians or a GP if you have any concerns about your vision.
If you have glaucoma, early diagnosis and treatment can help stop your vision getting worse.
Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness.
If you develop symptoms of glaucoma suddenly, go to your nearest eye casualty unit or A&E as soon as possible.
This is a medical emergency that may require immediate treatment."
Types of glaucoma,"There are several different types of glaucoma.
The most common is called primary open angle glaucoma. This tends to develop slowly over many years.
It's caused by the drainage channels in the eye becoming gradually clogged over time.
Other types of glaucoma include:
acute angle closure glaucoma – an uncommon type caused by the drainage in the eye becoming suddenly blocked, which can raise the pressure inside the eye very quickly
secondary glaucoma – caused by an underlying eye condition, such as inflammation of the eye (uveitis)
childhood glaucoma (congenital glaucoma) – a rare type that occurs in very young children, caused by an abnormality of the eye"
Causes of glaucoma,"Glaucoma can occur for a number of reasons.
Most cases are caused by a build-up of pressure in the eye when fluid is unable to drain properly.
This increase in pressure then damages the nerve that connects the eye to the brain (optic nerve).
It's often unclear why this happens, although certain things can increase the risk, including:
your age – glaucoma becomes more common as you get older
your ethnicity – people of African, Caribbean or Asian origin are at a higher risk
your family history – you're more likely to develop glaucoma if you have a parent or sibling with the condition
other medical conditions – such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness and diabetes
It's not clear whether you can do anything to prevent glaucoma, but having regular eye tests should pick it up as early as possible."
Tests for glaucoma,"Glaucoma can usually be detected during a routine eye test at an opticians, often before it causes any noticeable symptoms.
The tests are carried out in the opticians by an optometrist.
You should have a routine eye test at least every 2 years.
Find out if you're eligible for free NHS eye tests
Several quick and painless tests can be carried out to check for glaucoma, including vision tests and measurements of the pressure inside your eye.
If tests suggest you have glaucoma, you should be referred to a specialist eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to discuss treatment.
Find out how glaucoma is diagnosed"
Treatments for glaucoma,"It's not possible to reverse any loss of vision that occurred before glaucoma was diagnosed, but treatment can help stop your vision getting worse.
The treatment recommended for you will depend on the type of glaucoma you have, but the options are:
eyedrops – to reduce the pressure in your eyes
laser treatment – to open up the blocked drainage tubes or reduce the production of fluid in your eyes
surgery – to improve the drainage of fluid
You'll also probably need regular appointments to monitor your condition and check the treatment is working."
Further support for glaucoma,The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Glaucoma UK have more information on glaucoma and offer further support for people affected by glaucoma.
Symptoms of glomerulonephritis,"If you have severe glomerulonephritis, your pee may be a dark colour because it contains blood. But the blood in your pee may only be noticed when a sample is tested.
Your pee may also be frothy if it contains a large amount of protein.
If a lot of protein leaks into your urine, swelling of the legs or other parts of the body can also develop. This is known as nephrotic syndrome.
Depending on the cause of glomerulonephritis, other parts of your body can be affected with symptoms such as:
rashes
joint pain
stomach pain
high temperature
shortness of breath
yellowing of the whites of the eyes or the skin, although this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin (jaundice)
peeing a lot less than usual
tiredness
loss of appetite and weight loss
Some people with glomerulonephritis also have high blood pressure."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you notice blood in your urine. This does not always mean you have glomerulonephritis, but the cause should be investigated.
Also see a GP if you have other symptoms of glomerulonephritis, such as pain in your joints, tiredness and shortness of breath.
If the GP suspects glomerulonephritis, they'll usually arrange:
blood tests – to check how much protein is in your blood and measure your creatinine level (creatinine is a waste product produced by your muscles)
a urine test – to check for blood or protein in your pee
If you do have glomerulonephritis, further blood tests may be needed to help find out the cause.
If your kidney problem needs to be investigated further, other tests may be recommended, including:
an ultrasound scan – this is to check the size of your kidneys, make sure there are no blockages, and look for any other problems
a biopsy – this is to remove a small sample of kidney tissue, carried out using local anaesthetic to numb the area; an ultrasound machine locates your kidneys and a small needle is used to take a sample"
Causes of glomerulonephritis,"Glomerulonephritis often happens if there's a problem with your immune system. It can be caused by inflammatory conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or vasculitis.
In some cases, it can be caused by infections, such as:
HIV
hepatitis B and hepatitis C
infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocarditis)
Some types of cancer and certain medicines can also cause glomerulonephritis.
Sometimes it’s not clear what causes it.
If you're diagnosed with an inherited type of glomerulonephritis, a doctor can advise you about the chances of someone else in your family being affected.
They may recommend screening, which can identify people who may be at increased risk of developing the condition."
Treating glomerulonephritis,"Treatment for glomerulonephritis depends on the cause and severity of your condition. If an underlying condition can be identified, treating it can help.
Treatment can be as simple as making changes to your diet, such as eating less salt to reduce the strain on your kidneys.
Medicine to lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, is commonly prescribed because it helps protect the kidneys.
If the condition is caused by a problem with your immune system, medicine called immunosuppressants may be used.
Read about treating glomerulonephritis"
Complications of glomerulonephritis,"Although treatment for glomerulonephritis is effective in many cases, further problems can sometimes develop.
These include:
high blood pressure
high cholesterol
blood clots – including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism
damage to other organs
chronic kidney disease
kidney failure
If you're diagnosed with glomerulonephritis, a doctor may prescribe medicine to help lower your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol or protect against blood clots."
Check if it's glue ear,"The most common symptom of glue ear is temporary hearing loss. It can affect both ears at the same time.
Other symptoms may include:
earache or ear pain
hearing sounds like ringing or buzzing (tinnitus)
problems with balance
If glue ear lasts a long time, it can affect a child's speech development and progress at school.
Glue ear is much more common in children, but adults with glue ear have the same symptoms."
What happens at your appointment,"A GP should be able to tell if it's glue ear by looking for fluid inside the ear.
They'll use a small scope with a light and magnifying glass. This should not be painful.
If your child has had glue ear for more than 3 months, they may be referred to a specialist for hearing tests.
Hearing tests can help find out how severe any hearing loss is and what's causing it."
Treatment for glue ear from a GP,"Glue ear is not always treated. The GP will usually wait to see if the symptoms get better on their own.
This is because there's no effective medicine for glue ear, and it often clears up on its own within 3 months.
Your child may be monitored for up to a year in case their symptoms change or get worse.
The GP may suggest trying a treatment called autoinflation while waiting for symptoms to improve. Autoinflation can help fluid in the ear to drain.
It's done by either:
blowing up a special balloon using 1 nostril at a time
swallowing while holding the nostrils closed
As autoinflation has to be done several times a day, it's not usually recommended for children under 3 years old.
Antibiotics may be prescribed if glue ear causes an ear infection.
Hospital treatment
Your child may be referred to a specialist in hospital if:
glue ear symptoms are affecting their learning and development
they already had severe hearing loss before glue ear
they have Down's syndrome or a cleft lip and palate, as glue ear is less likely to get better by itself
The 2 main treatments are temporary hearing aids or grommets (small tubes implanted in the ear).
Occasionally, surgery may be recommended to remove some glands at the back of the nose (adenoids). This is known as an adenoidectomy.
The specialist in hospital will help you decide on the best treatment option.
Grommets for glue ear
A grommet is a small tube that's placed in your child's ear during surgery. It drains fluid away and keeps the eardrum open.
The grommet should fall out naturally within 6 to 12 months as your child's ear gets better."
Diagnosing GA1,"At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.
If GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications.
With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life.
Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing."
Symptoms of GA1,"Symptoms of GA1 usually don't appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly).
Children with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there's a risk of developing bleeding around their brain (subdural haematoma). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage)."
Metabolic crisis,"Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include:
poor feeding or loss of appetite
lack of energy
abnormal movements
vomiting
irritability
breathing difficulties
It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs.
In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing."
Treating GA1,"Diet
Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan.
High-protein foods need to be limited, including:
meat
fish
cheese
eggs
pulses
nuts
Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.
Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.
People with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.
Medication
Your child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid.
L-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor.
Emergency treatment
If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill.
Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal.
Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill.
Contact the metabolic team at the hospital when your baby becomes unwell, and let them know you have started the emergency diet.
If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, has a high temperature that does not go down, or their symptoms are getting worse, take your baby straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department.
You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen GA1 before.
Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein).
You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties."
How GA1 is inherited,"The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.
The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the affected gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of GA1.
If you're a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:
a 25% chance of developing the condition
a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1
a 25% chance of receiving a pair of unaffected genes
Although it's not possible to prevent GA1, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.
You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions."
Information about you,"If you or your child has GA1, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS on GOV.UK"
Check if you have a goitre,"The main symptom of a goitre is a swelling at the front of the neck, which is usually painless.
A goitre usually appears at the lower front of the neck.
Credit:
Goitres may look and feel either smooth or lumpy.
The swelling may sometimes just be on 1 side of your neck.
Credit:

You may also have other symptoms including:
a cough that does not go away
a hoarse voice or voice changes
feeling like something is stuck in your throat
a wheezing noise when you breathe
finding it hard to swallow or breathe"
Treatments for a goitre,"Most goitres are small and do not cause any problems. Sometimes they do not need treatment.
You will usually need tests like blood tests and sometimes an ultrasound scan to find out what is causing your goitre.
If it is caused by a health condition like an underactive or overactive thyroid, it can usually be treated with medicines.
If your goitre is making breathing and swallowing difficult, you may have surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid."
Causes of a goitre,"A goitre happens when your thyroid gland is swollen.
Some reasons why your thyroid might be swollen include:
an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)
an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
harmless lumps (nodules) on the thyroid
hormone changes during puberty, pregnancy or the menopause
an inflamed thyroid gland (thyroiditis)
having a condition with your immune system, like Grave's disease
not enough iodine in your diet - this is rare in the UK
thyroid cancer – this is rare"
How gonorrhoea is spread,"The bacteria that cause gonorrhoea are mainly found in discharge from the penis and in vaginal fluid.
Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through:
unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex
sharing vibrators or other sex toys that have not been washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used
The bacteria can infect the entrance to the womb (cervix), the tube that passes urine out of the body (urethra), the rectum and, less commonly, the throat or eyes.
The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. If you're pregnant and may have gonorrhoea, it's important to get tested and treated before your baby is born.
Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness in a newborn baby.
Gonorrhoea is not spread by hugging, swimming pools, toilet seats or sharing baths, towels, cups, plates or cutlery. The bacteria cannot survive outside the human body for long."
Symptoms of gonorrhoea,"Typical symptoms of gonorrhoea include a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, pain when peeing and, in women, bleeding between periods.
But around 1 in 10 infected men and almost half of infected women do not experience any symptoms."
Getting tested,"If you have any of the symptoms of gonorrhoea or you're worried you may have an STI, you should visit a sexual health clinic for a sexual health test.
Find a sexual health clinic
You can also contact the national sexual health helpline free on 0300 123 7123:
Monday to Friday: 9am to 8pm
Saturday and Sunday: 11am to 4pm
Gonorrhoea can be easily diagnosed by testing a sample of discharge picked up using a swab. In men, testing a sample of urine can also diagnose the condition.
It's important to get tested as soon as possible because gonorrhoea can lead to more serious long-term health problems if it's not treated, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women or infertility.
Read more about:

possible complications of gonorrhoea
visiting an STI clinic"
Treating gonorrhoea,"Gonorrhoea is usually treated with a single antibiotic injection (usually in the buttocks or thigh). With effective treatment, most of your symptoms should improve within a few days.
It's usually recommended you attend a follow-up appointment a week or 2 after treatment so another test can be carried out to see if you're clear of infection.
You should avoid having sex until you have been told you no longer have the infection.
Previous successful treatment for gonorrhoea does not make you immune to catching it again."
Who's affected,"Anyone who's sexually active can catch gonorrhoea, particularly people who change partners frequently or do not use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, when having sex. (See Your contraception guide.)
Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK after chlamydia.
In 2019, more than 70,000 people were diagnosed with gonorrhoea in England, with most cases affecting gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men."
Preventing gonorrhoea,"Gonorrhoea and other STIs can be successfully prevented by using appropriate contraception and taking other precautions, such as:
using male condoms or female condoms every time you have vaginal sex, or male condoms during anal sex
using a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the female genitals if you have oral sex
not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them
If you're worried you may have an STI, visit a sexual health clinic for advice.

Check if it's gout,"The main symptoms of gout are:
sudden severe pain in a joint – usually your big toe, but it can be in other joints in your feet, ankles, hands, wrists, elbows or knees
hot, swollen, red skin over the affected joint – redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin."
What happens at your appointment,"The GP may ask about your diet and if you drink alcohol if you have symptoms of gout.
They may also do a test to measure how much uric acid is in your blood. Uric acid is a chemical that can lead to crystals forming around your joints which cause pain.
If the test is still unclear, a GP may refer you to see a specialist (rheumatologist) and arrange further tests.
This could include taking a sample of fluid from inside the affected joint, using a thin needle. If this test cannot be done or the diagnosis is still unclear, then a scan will be arranged."
Treatments for gout,"Treatment for gout attacks
Attacks of gout are usually treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), like ibuprofen.
If the pain and swelling does not improve you may be given steroids as tablets or an injection.
Treatment to prevent gout coming back
Gout can come back every few months or it may be years. It can come back more often if it's not treated.
If you have frequent attacks or high levels of uric acid in your blood, you may need to take uric acid-lowering medicine.
Important
It's important to take uric acid-lowering medicine regularly, even when you no longer have symptoms."
Things you can do to help a gout attack,"If you’re having a gout attack, there are things you can do to relieve the pain:
Do
take any medicine you've been prescribed as soon as possible – it should start to work within 2 days
rest and raise the limb
keep the joint cool – apply an ice pack, or a bag of frozen peas, wrapped in a towel for up to 20 minutes at a time
drink lots of water (unless a GP tells you not to)
try to keep bedclothes off the affected joint at night
Don’t
put pressure on the joint – this can make the pain feel worse"
Who gets gout,"Gout is caused by having too much uric acid in your blood. This can lead to crystals forming around your joints, which causes pain.
It sometimes runs in families.
It's more common in men, especially as they get older.
You might have a higher chance of getting gout if you:
are overweight
drink alcohol
have been through the menopause
take medicines such as diuretics (water tablets), or medicines for high blood pressure (such as ACE inhibitors)
have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, kidney problems, osteoarthritis or diabetes
have had surgery or an injury
Things that can trigger a gout attack
You might get a gout attack if you:
have an illness that causes a high temperature
drink too much alcohol or eat a very large, fatty meal
get dehydrated
injure a joint
take certain medicines
Get treatment immediately if you feel an attack starting."
Things you can do to help prevent gout coming back,"Making healthy lifestyle choices may mean you can stop or reduce further gout attacks:
Do
try to lose weight if you are overweight, but avoid crash diets
eat a healthy diet – your doctor may give you a list of foods to include or limit
have some alcohol-free days each week – try not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week
drink plenty of fluids to avoid getting dehydrated
exercise regularly – but avoid intense exercise or putting lots of pressure on joints
try to quit smoking
ask a GP about vitamin C supplements
Don’t
have lots of sugary drinks and snacks
eat lots of fatty foods"
Complications of gout,"If you get repeated attacks of gout over a long period of time (chronic gout), and are not treated it can lead to:
damage in your joints
hard lumps, called tophi, under your skin, usually on your ears, fingers or elbows – they can be painful and have an impact on your daily life
kidney stones
chronic arthritis – but this is rare"
Check if you have granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare mainly affects children, teenagers and young adults, but older adults can get it too.
The most common symptom is small circular patches of pink, purple or skin-coloured bumps on the skin.
Credit:
The patches can appear on 1 or more places on your body. They tend to affect bony areas such as the back of the hands, fingers, elbows and feet.
The patches are usually raised and grow slowly to around 2.5 to 5cm. They may eventually become flatter before gradually fading.
Granuloma annulare may be harder to see on black and brown skin.
Credit:
In older adults, granuloma annulare is often made up of lots of small pink or skin-coloured bumps that cover large areas of the arms, legs or trunk (chest, tummy and back).
Credit:
Less commonly, granuloma annulare can cause 1 or more firm, rubbery lumps just under the skin, usually on the feet and fingertips.
Credit:"
Treatments for granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare is harmless and sometimes disappears without treatment. But it can take a long time to clear up (2 to 10 years) and it often comes back.
A skin specialist (dermatologist) may suggest treatment if granuloma annulare affects a visible or large area of your body and it’s affecting your life.
Treatments for granuloma annulare can include:
steroid medicines – which may be creams, tablets or injections
freezing small areas of skin (cryotherapy) – this can leave a permanent scar
ultraviolet light therapy – light is used to reduce the inflammation in the skin
skin camouflage (make-up)
There are different types of granuloma annulare and some can be difficult to treat. Your doctor will talk to you about your options."
Causes of granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare is inflammation in the deep layer of the skin called the dermis.
The exact cause is unknown, but some types may be related to other health problems, such as diabetes and thyroid conditions like Graves' disease.
You cannot catch granuloma annulare from someone who has it."
Symptoms of GPA,"GPA can cause a range of symptoms depending on which parts of the body are affected.
General symptoms include:
tiredness
a high temperature
muscle weakness
loss of appetite
unintentional weight loss 
joint pain
Ear, nose and throat problems:
a blocked or runny nose
nosebleeds
crusts around the nostrils
face pain (sinusitis)
earache
hearing loss
Lung problems:
a cough that does not go away
shortness of breath
wheezing
chest pain
Kidney problems:
blood in pee
high blood pressure
inflammation of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis)
Skin problems:
rashes
lumps
small purple spots
Eye problems
irritated eyes (conjunctivitis)
swollen eyelids
double vision
Gut problems:
tummy pain
diarrhoea
blood in poo
If it's not treated, GPA can cause permanent damage to some parts of the body. For example, it can change the shape of the nose or stop the kidneys working properly."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have symptoms of GPA, especially if they do not go away.
The GP can do some simple checks to try to find out what's causing your symptoms and can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests, if needed.
If you've already been diagnosed with GPA, contact your doctor if any of your old symptoms come back or you get any new symptoms. Your treatment may need to be changed."
Tests for GPA,"GPA can be difficult to diagnose. It causes a range of symptoms that are often similar to other common conditions.
A specialist doctor may:
ask about your symptoms and examine the affected parts of your body
do a urine test to check how well your kidneys are working
do a blood test to look for substances called ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), which are thought to be involved in GPA
remove a small sample of tissue (a biopsy) and check it for signs of inflammation
organise an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan to look at the affected parts of the body in more detail"
Treatments for GPA,"GPA is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system. It's treated with medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system.
There are 3 main stages of treatment.
Stage 1: Bringing the condition under control
The first aim of treatment is to bring the symptoms of GPA under control. This usually involves:
having injections of a medicine called cyclophosphamide every 2 or 3 weeks, or taking it as tablets every day (occasionally, other medicines – such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab – may be used instead)
taking steroid tablets every day or having steroid injections into your blood at the same time as the cyclophosphamide injections
These are all strong medicines, so make sure you discuss the possible side effects with your doctor.
Some people also need a plasma exchange, where a machine is used to filter the blood to remove the harmful antibodies linked to GPA.
This first stage of treatment lasts until your symptoms are under control, which usually takes a few months.
Stage 2: Keeping the condition under control
Once the condition is under control, treatment aims to stop your symptoms coming back. This usually involves:
stopping treatment with cyclophosphamide
taking medicine that helps ""calm"" (or control) your body's immune system, such as an immunosuppressant like methotrexate or azathioprine
taking steroid tablets every day
This stage of treatment typically lasts for 2 to 5 years.
Stage 3: Treating symptoms if they come back
If your symptoms come back or you get new symptoms (a relapse) at any point, your treatment may be changed or restarted.
For example, your dose of steroids may be increased, and you may need to have more cyclophosphamide injections, start treatment with rituximab, or possibly have a course of plasma exchange."
Living with GPA,"GPA is a serious condition but, with treatment, it can usually be kept under control.
You might need to take medicine for several years and you'll have regular check-ups in case your symptoms come back.
About half of people with GPA have a relapse within a few years of their treatment stopping. Further treatment can help bring the condition back under control if this happens.
If GPA is severe or is not treated quickly, there is a risk that life-threatening problems could develop, such as permanent damage to the kidneys that may require a kidney transplant.
This is why it's important to contact your doctor as soon as possible if your symptoms come back or you start getting new ones."
Support and advice if you have GPA,"For more information and advice, you may find it useful to check the Vasculitis UK website.
Vasculitis UK is an organisation for people with vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels). GPA is a type of vasculitis.
The Vasculitis UK website has information about living and coping with vasculitis, including advice about general health, benefits and insurance."
Causes of GPA,"The exact cause of GPA is unknown.
It may be due to problems with the immune system, which makes it attack and inflame the blood vessels. But it's not clear why this happens.
People with GPA may have a gene that makes them more likely to get the condition. It might then be triggered by something like a virus or bacterial infection, although this has not been proven.
Genes alone are not responsible for GPA because it's very unusual for 2 people in the same family to have it."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have GPA, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat GPA. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Group B strep in pregnancy,"Group B strep is common in pregnant women and rarely causes any problems.
It's not routinely tested for, but may be found during tests carried out for another reason, such as a urine test or vaginal swab.
Risks in pregnancy
If you have group B strep while you're pregnant:
your baby will usually be healthy
there's a small risk it could spread to your baby during labour and make them ill – this happens in about 1 in 1,750 pregnancies
there's an extremely small risk you could miscarry or lose your baby
What to do if you're worried
If you're worried about group B strep, speak to your midwife or GP for advice.
Talk to them about the risks to your baby and ask their advice about whether to get tested.
Routine testing is not currently recommended and tests are rarely done on the NHS, but you can pay for one privately.
Find out more about getting tested for group B strep on the Group B Strep Support website
What happens if you have group B strep
If tests find group B strep, or you've had a baby that's been affected by it before, you may need extra care and treatment.
You may be advised to:
speak to your midwife about your birth plan – they may recommend giving birth in hospital
contact your midwife as soon as you go into labour or your waters break
have antibiotics into a vein during labour – this can significantly reduce the risk of your baby getting ill
stay in hospital for at least 12 hours after giving birth so your baby can be monitored – this is not always necessary"
Group B strep in babies,"If you had group B strep during pregnancy, there's a small risk it could spread to your baby and make them very ill.
If this happens, it's usually soon after they're born. Your baby may be monitored in hospital for up to 12 hours to check for any problems.
They'll be given antibiotics into a vein if they develop symptoms.
What to look for after leaving hospital
Occasionally, symptoms of a group B strep infection can develop up to 3 months after birth.
Call 999 or go to A&E if your baby gets any of these symptoms:
being floppy or unresponsive
grunting when breathing, or working hard to breathe when you look at their chest or stomach
very fast or slow breathing
an unusually high or low temperature
changes in their skin colour or blotchy skin
not feeding well or vomiting milk up
an unusually fast or slow heart rate
They may need treatment with antibiotics in hospital immediately.
Risks in babies
Most babies with a group B strep infection make a full recovery if treated.
Some babies may develop serious problems like sepsis or meningitis.
This can cause lasting problems like hearing loss or loss of vision. Sometimes it can be fatal."

Check if it's growing pains,"The symptoms of growing pains can come and go over months, even years.
The pain is usually:
an aching or throbbing in both legs
in the muscles, not the joints
in the evening or night-time (and goes away by morning)"
Things you can do to ease growing pains,"Do
gently massage your child's legs
put a covered hot water bottle or heat pack on the painful area
give children's ibuprofen or paracetamol to ease the pain
Don’t
do not give aspirin to a child under the age of 16 unless a doctor prescribes it"
Causes of growing pains,"It's not known what causes growing pains.
They are not caused by growing and they are not a sign of anything serious.
Growing pains are more common in active children and can happen after playing lots of sport.
They are also common in children with very flexible joints (joint hypermobility syndrome)"
Symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome,"Symptoms often start in your feet and hands before spreading to your arms and legs.
At first you may have:
numbness
pins and needles
muscle weakness
pain
problems with balance and co-ordination
These symptoms may continue to get worse over the next few days or weeks before they start to slowly improve. In severe cases, you may have difficulty moving, walking, breathing and/or swallowing.
Read more about the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome. "
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you notice any of the early symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome, such as numbness or weakness.
Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if someone:
has difficulty breathing, swallowing or speaking
cannot move their limbs or face
This is a medical emergency and the person needs to be seen in hospital as soon as possible.
Read more about how Guillain-Barré syndrome is diagnosed."
Causes of Guillain-Barré syndrome,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
Normally the immune system attacks any germs that get into the body. But in people with Guillain-Barré syndrome, something goes wrong and it mistakenly attacks and damages the nerves.
It's not clear exactly why this happens, but the condition often happens after an infection; especially an infection of the airways, such as flu, or an infection of the digestive system, such as food poisoning or a stomach bug (gastroenteritis).
Read more about causes of Guillain-Barré syndrome."
Treatments for Guillain-Barré syndrome,"Most people with Guillain-Barré syndrome are treated in hospital.
The main treatments are:
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) – a treatment made from donated blood that helps bring your immune system under control
plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) – an alternative to IVIG where a machine is used to filter your blood to remove the harmful substances that are attacking your nerves
treatments to reduce symptoms such as painkillers
treatments to support body functions, such as a machine to help with breathing and/or a feeding tube
Most people need to stay in hospital for a few weeks to a few months.
Read more about how Guillain-Barré syndrome is treated."
Recovering from Guillain-Barré syndrome,"Most people with Guillain-Barré syndrome will recover from most of their symptoms within 6 to 12 months. But it can take from several months to several years to fully recover from the nerve damage caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome.
However, around 1 in 5 people are left with long-term problems such as:
being unable to walk without assistance
weakness in the arms, legs or face
numbness, pain or a tingling or burning sensation
balance and co-ordination problems
extreme tiredness
Therapies such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy (a speech and language therapist can help with both communication and swallowing difficulties) may help you recover and cope with any lasting difficulties.
In a minority of cases, Guillain-Barré syndrome can cause life-threatening problems such as severe breathing difficulties or blood clots. Overall, around 1 in 20 will die from Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Read more about recovering from Guillain-Barré syndrome."
Check if you have gum disease,"Symptoms of gum disease include:
your gums bleeding when you brush your teeth, floss or eat hard foods such as apples
your gums becoming swollen, red and sore
Gum disease can lead to:
bad breath and a bad taste in the mouth
your gums shrinking
your teeth becoming loose or falling out"
Treatments for gum disease,"Your dentist will check your teeth and gums, and may take some X-rays to check your teeth and jaw bone.
They may also refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
How gum disease is treated depends on how severe it is.
In the early stages, your dentist will:
give you advice about keeping your teeth clean, such as using interdental brushes
advise you to stop smoking, if you smoke
advise you to get your teeth cleaned by a hygienist
If your gum disease is serious, you may need:
to have deep cleaning under the gums
antibiotics
to have some teeth removed
gum surgery"
Preventing gum disease,"Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth.
If you do not remove plaque from your teeth by brushing and cleaning in between them regularly, it builds up and irritates your gums.
There are things you can do yourself to prevent gum disease.
Do
brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day – spit after brushing, do not rinse
clean in between your teeth every day using floss or interdental brushes
replace your toothbrush every 1 to 3 months
see a dentist and dental hygienist for regular check-ups, especially if you're pregnant or have type 2 diabetes
Don’t
do not use mouthwash straight after brushing your teeth
do not smoke"
Symptoms of haemochromatosis,"Symptoms of haemochromatosis usually start between the ages of 30 and 60.
Common symptoms include:
feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)
weight loss
weakness
joint pain
an inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)
irregular periods or stopped or missed periods
Brain fog, mood swings, depression and anxiety
Read more about symptoms of haemochromatosis"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have:
persistent or worrying symptoms that could be caused by haemochromatosis – particularly if you have a northern European family background
a parent or sibling with haemochromatosis, even if you do not have symptoms yourself – tests can be done to check if you're at risk of developing problems
Talk to the GP about whether you should have blood tests to check for haemochromatosis.
Read more about tests for haemochromatosis"
Treatments for haemochromatosis,"There's currently no cure for haemochromatosis, but there are treatments that can reduce the amount of iron in the body and reduce the risk of damage.
There are 2 main treatments.
venesection (phlebotomy) – a procedure to remove some of your blood; this may need to be done every week at first and can continue to be needed 2 to 4 times a year for the rest of your life
chelation therapy – where you take medicine to reduce the amount of iron in your body; this is only used if it's not easy to regularly remove some of your blood
You do not need to make any big changes to your diet to control your iron levels if you're having treatment, but you'll usually be advised to avoid:
breakfast cereals containing added iron
iron or vitamin C supplements
drinking too much alcohol
Read more about how haemochromatosis is treated"
Causes of haemochromatosis,"Haemochromatosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects how the body absorbs iron from your diet.
You're at risk of developing the condition if both of your parents have this faulty gene and you inherit 1 copy from each of them.
You will not get haemochromatosis if you only inherit 1 copy of the faulty gene but there's a chance you could pass the faulty gene on to any children you have.
If you do inherit 2 copies, you will not necessarily get haemochromatosis. Only a small number of people with 2 copies of this faulty gene will ever develop the condition. It's not known exactly why this is.
Read more about the causes of haemochromatosis"
Complications of haemochromatosis,"If the condition is diagnosed and treated early on, haemochromatosis does not affect life expectancy and is unlikely to result in serious problems.
But if it's not found until it's more advanced, the high iron levels can damage parts of the body.
This can lead to potentially serious complications, such as:
liver problems – including scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or liver cancer
diabetes – where the level of sugar in the blood becomes too high
arthritis – pain and swelling in the joints
heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly
Read more about complications of haemochromatosis"
Further support,Haemochromatosis UK is a patient-run UK charity that provides information and support to people living with haemochromatosis.
Symptoms of haemophilia,"The symptoms of haemophilia can be mild to severe, depending on the level of clotting factors you have.
The main symptom is bleeding that does not stop.
People with haemophilia may have:
nosebleeds that take a long time to stop
bleeding from wounds that lasts a long time
bleeding gums
skin that bruises easily
pain and stiffness around joints, such as elbows, because of bleeding inside the body (internal bleeding)
Read more about the symptoms of haemophilia."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if:
you or your child bruises easily and has bleeding that does not stop
your or your child has symptoms of joint bleeds – for example, tingling, pain, or stiffness in a joint, and the joint becoming hot, swollen, and tender
you have a family history of haemophilia and you're pregnant or planning to have a baby
There's a small risk that people with haemophilia may have a bleed inside their skull (a brain or subarachnoid haemorrhage).
Symptoms of a brain haemorrhage include:
a severe headache
a stiff neck
being sick (vomiting)
a change in mental state, such as confusion
difficulty speaking, such as slurred speech
changes in vision, such as double vision
loss of co-ordination and balance
paralysis of some or all the facial muscles
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you think someone's bleeding inside their skull."
Your local haemophilia centre,"If you have haemophilia, register at your local haemophilia centre. It's a useful source of advice and support.
People with haemophilia are cared for by a hospital haematology department.
Find haematology services near you."
Tests and diagnosis,"Blood tests can diagnose haemophilia and find out how severe it is. 
If there's no family history of haemophilia, it's usually diagnosed when a child begins to walk or crawl. 
Mild haemophilia may only be discovered later, usually after an injury or a dental or surgical procedure.
Genetic tests and pregnancy
If you have a family history of haemophilia and you're planning to get pregnant, genetic and genomic testing can help you find out the risk of passing the condition on to a child.
This may involve testing a sample of your tissue or blood to look for signs of the genetic change that causes haemophilia.
Tests during pregnancy can diagnose haemophilia in the baby. These include:
chorionic villus sampling (CVS) – a small sample of the placenta is removed from the womb and tested for the haemophilia gene, usually during weeks 11 to 14 of pregnancy
amniocentesis – a sample of amniotic fluid is taken for testing, usually during weeks 15 to 20 of pregnancy
There's a small risk of these procedures causing problems such as miscarriage or premature labour, so you may find it helpful to discuss this with your doctor.
If haemophilia is suspected after your child's born, a blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. Blood from the umbilical cord can be tested at birth."
Treatments for haemophilia,"There's no cure for haemophilia, but treatment usually allows a person with the condition to enjoy a good quality of life.
Man-made clotting factors are given as medicines to prevent and treat prolonged bleeding. These medicines are given as an injection. 
In milder cases, injections are usually only given in response to prolonged bleeding. More severe cases are treated with regular injections to prevent bleeding.
Read more about treatments for haemophilia."
Living with haemophilia,"With treatment, most people with haemophilia can live a normal life.
However, you should:
avoid contact sports, such as rugby
be careful taking other medicines – some can affect your blood's ability to clot, such as aspirin and ibuprofen
take care of your teeth and gums and have regular check-ups at the dentist
Looking after your teeth and gums helps you avoid problems such as gum disease, which can cause bleeding. Most non-surgical dental treatment can be done at a general dental surgery.
Your care team at the hospital can give you advice about surgical dental procedures, such as having a tooth removed, and further information and advice about living with haemophilia."
Information about you,"If you have haemophilia, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists better understand the condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS in a leaflet you can download at GOV.UK"
Complications of Hib infection,"A Hib infection can cause serious conditions including:
infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)
a severe immune reaction (sepsis)
infection of part of your windpipe (epiglottitis)
infection of the lungs (pneumonia)
You can become very ill with these conditions and will need treatment in hospital.
Even with successful treatment, there may be lasting effects such as hearing loss, seizures, loss of limbs and learning disabilities."
Symptoms of a Hib infection,"Symptoms of Hib infection depend on what part of the body is affected.
Symptoms may include:
a high temperature
difficulty breathing – babies may make grunting noises
being sleepier than normal or difficult to wake
blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin this may be noticeable under the nails or around the eyes
a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not disappear when you press a glass against it
a headache
a sore throat
swollen or painful joints"
Treatment for Hib infection,"The main treatment for a Hib infection is antibiotics. You'll usually need to be treated in hospital.
You may be given oxygen and other medicines such as steroids, depending on your symptoms. Other treatments, including surgery, may also be needed.
If you have a Hib infection, your close contacts, such as anyone you live with, may be offered antibiotics to stop them getting ill."
Hib vaccination,"Vaccination is the best way to prevent serious Hib infections.
Vaccines that protect against Hib are offered to babies as part of the NHS vaccination schedule.
There are 2 vaccines that protect against Hib:
6-in-1 vaccine – given in 3 doses at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old
Hib/Men C vaccine – a booster vaccine given at 1 year old
If your child was not vaccinated as a baby, you can ask your GP about how they can get it."
How Hib spreads,"Hib is spread by sneezing and coughing, the same as how colds and flu spread.
Hib bacteria can live in the nose and throat of many healthy people without causing any problems. But healthy people can still pass it on and cause others to get ill.
Some people are more at risk of getting seriously ill from a Hib infection including:
babies and young children
people with a weakened immune system, including people who have had their spleen removed
older people"
Check if it's piles,"Symptoms of piles include:
bright red blood after you poo
an itchy anus
feeling like you still need to poo after going to the toilet
mucus in your underwear or on toilet paper after wiping your bottom
lumps around your anus
pain around your anus"
How you can treat or prevent piles,"Do
drink lots of fluid and eat plenty of fibre to keep your poo soft
wipe your bottom with damp toilet paper
take paracetamol if piles hurt
take a warm bath to ease itching and pain
use an ice pack wrapped in a towel to ease discomfort
gently push a pile back inside
keep your bottom clean and dry
exercise regularly
cut down on alcohol and caffeine (like tea, coffee and cola) to avoid constipation
Don’t
do not wipe your bottom too hard after you poo
do not ignore the urge to poo
do not push too hard when pooing
do not take painkillers that contain codeine, as they can cause constipation
do not take ibuprofen if your piles are bleeding
do not spend more time than you need to on the toilet
Ask a pharmacist about treatment for piles
A pharmacist can suggest:
creams to ease the pain, itching and swelling
treatment to help constipation and soften poo
cold packs to ease discomfort
Many pharmacies have private areas if you do not want to be overheard.
Find a pharmacy"
Hospital treatment for piles,"If there's no improvement to your piles after home treatments, you may need hospital treatment.
Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you. Treatment does not always prevent piles coming back.
Treatment without surgery
Common hospital treatments include:
rubber band ligation: a band is placed around your piles to make them drop off
sclerotherapy: a liquid is injected into your piles to make them shrink
electrotherapy: a gentle electric current is applied to your piles to make them shrink
infrared coagulation: an infrared light is used to cut the blood supply to your piles to make them shrink
You'll be awake for this type of treatment, but the area will be numbed.
You should be able to go home on the same day.
If these treatments do not work, you may need surgery to remove your piles.
Surgery
Surgical treatments include:
haemorrhoidectomy: your piles are cut out
stapled haemorrhoidopexy: your piles are stapled back inside your anus
haemorrhoidal artery ligation: stitches are used to cut the blood supply to your piles to make them shrink
You'll usually need to be asleep for this type of treatment and may need to stay in hospital for more than 1 day."
What causes piles?,"Piles are swollen blood vessels. It's not clear what causes them.
Things that make piles more likely:
constipation
pushing too hard when pooing
heavy lifting
pregnancy"
Why some people are sensitive to hair dye,"Some people are prone to a skin reaction called contact dermatitis.
This means their skin may become red, dry, scaly, bumpy, blistered, or irritated (inflamed) when they come into contact with a particular substance.
The substance may either be an irritant, directly damaging the skin, or an allergen, triggering an allergic reaction that affects the skin.
Many permanent and some semi-permanent hair dyes contain a chemical called paraphenylenediamine (PPD), which is a known irritant and allergen.
Darker coloured dyes contain higher level of PPD.
PPD is the cause of most reactions to hair dye.
Is PPD safe?
Hair dyes containing PPD are safe to use, providing safety instructions are followed. These products are strictly regulated and there's a maximum limit to the amount of PPD the product can contain.
If you ignore the safety instructions that come with the dye, you could put yourself at risk of a serious reaction.
You're particularly at risk if you have (or have previously had) a black henna tattoo.
These temporary tattoos should be avoided because the paste often contains high levels of PPD, which can increase the risk of an allergic reaction the next time you're exposed to it. So, you could develop a life-threatening allergic reaction when you next use PPD hair dye.
Learn more about the dangers of black henna tattoos."
How to avoid a reaction to hair dye,"Patch test
Always carry out a patch test before using a permanent or semi-permanent hair dye, even if you are using your regular brand.
This usually involves dabbing a small amount of the dye solution behind your ear or on your inner elbow and leaving it to dry. Follow the instructions that come with the dye.
If you develop any irritation or feel unwell after the patch test, do not use the product.
Allergy clinic
You could also have a patch test done at an allergy clinic, to see which chemicals you're sensitive to, if any. You can then check product labels and avoid products containing these chemicals. However, the clinic may not test all hair dye chemicals.
Other precautions
If you do not develop any reaction from the patch test, you can continue to use the dye, but make sure you:
do not leave it on for longer than the recommended time
wear gloves when applying the dye
rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards
carefully follow the instructions included"
Signs and symptoms of a hair dye reaction,"Reactions to PPD can range from mild irritation in the scalp to an allergic reaction that can potentially trigger serious symptoms throughout the body.
Mild irritation
If you're mildly irritated by PPD, you may find that your scalp, neck, forehead, ears or eyelids become irritated and inflamed after using hair dye.
The skin exposed to the PPD may become red, swollen, blistered, dry, thickened and cracked. You may feel a burning or stinging sensation.
Symptoms will usually appear within 48 hours, although strong irritants may cause your skin to react immediately.
Learn more about irritant contact dermatitis.
Allergic reaction
If you're allergic to PPD, your scalp and face may feel itchy and start to swell.
PPD may also trigger symptoms throughout your body, such as itching, a nettle rash and generally feeling ill.
These symptoms may not develop until hours, or even days, later.
A severe allergic reaction that develops within minutes is called anaphylaxis, or ""anaphylactic shock"". Signs of anaphylaxis include:
itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash
swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet – the eyelids can swell so much that the eyes close
feeling lightheaded or faint
swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties
wheezing
tummy pain, nausea and vomiting
collapsing and becoming unconscious"
What to do if you have a reaction,"Dial 999 for an ambulance if you think you or someone you’re with is having a severe allergic reaction. Give an adrenaline injection if you have one.
If you think you're experiencing a reaction to hair dye but it's not an emergency, follow this advice:
Relieving mild symptoms
wash your hair and scalp thoroughly with mild shampoo to remove any excess dye
try gently applying an emollient (moisturising treatment) such as aqueous cream or petroleum jelly to the affected skin
Steroid cream
If your skin is very red, sore and inflamed, you may need to try a steroid cream (topical corticosteroid). You can buy a mild steroid cream at a pharmacy or a GP may prescribe it.
Read more about the treatment of contact dermatitis.
Antihistamine medicines
Medicines called antihistamines can help reduce skin inflammation and itching. A pharmacist or GP will be able to recommend an antihistamine for you."
Avoiding products with PPD,"If you develop a reaction to hair dye, even just a mild one, you should stop using products containing PPD altogether, as there's a risk you could develop a more severe reaction in the future.
Try switching to a safer alternative, such as a non-permanent, PPD-free hair dye – but be aware that it's still possible to develop a reaction to this."
Causes of hair loss,"It's normal to lose hair. We can lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day, often without noticing.
Hair loss is not usually anything to be worried about, but occasionally it can be a sign of a medical condition.
Some types of hair loss are permanent, like male and female pattern baldness. This type of hair loss usually runs in the family.
Other types of hair loss may be temporary. They can be caused by:
an illness
stress
cancer treatment
weight loss
iron deficiency"
What happens at your appointment,"The GP may be able to tell you what's causing your hair loss by looking at your hair.
Tell them if your hair loss is affecting your wellbeing, and ask what treatments are available.
Important
See a GP to get an idea about what's causing your hair loss before thinking about going to a commercial hair clinic."
Treatment for hair loss,"Most hair loss does not need treatment and is either:
temporary and it'll grow back
a normal part of getting older
Hair loss caused by a medical condition usually stops or grows back once you've recovered.
There are things you can try if your hair loss is causing you distress. But most treatments are not available on the NHS, so you'll have to pay for them.
No treatment is 100% effective.
Finasteride and minoxidil
Finasteride and minoxidil are the main treatments for male pattern baldness.
Minoxidil can also be used to treat female pattern baldness. Women should not use finasteride.
These treatments:
do not work for everyone
only work for as long as they're used
are not available on the NHS
can be expensive
Wigs
Some wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for financial help.
Synthetic wigs:
last 6 to 9 months
are easier to look after than real-hair wigs
can be itchy and hot
cost less than real-hair wigs
Real-hair wigs:
last 3 to 4 years
are harder to look after than synthetic wigs
look more natural than synthetic wigs
cost more than synthetic wigs"
Emotional help,"Losing hair can be upsetting. For many people, their hair is an important part of who they are.
If your hair loss is causing you distress, your GP may be able to help you get some counselling.
You may also benefit from joining a support group, or speaking to other people in the same situation on online forums."
Types of hallucinations,"You may have hallucinations if you:
hear sounds or voices that nobody else hears
see things that are not there like objects, shapes, people or lights
feel touch or movement in your body that is not real like bugs are crawling on your skin or your internal organs are moving around.
smell things that do not exist
taste things that only you feel are not pleasant or is strange
think that your body is moving like flying or floating when it is not"
Causes of hallucinations,"Hallucinations can be caused by many different health conditions that affect the senses.
Common causes of hallucinations include:
mental health conditions like schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder
drugs and alcohol
Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease
a change or loss of vision, such as Charles Bonnet syndrome
anxiety, depression or bereavement
side effect from medicines
after surgery and anaesthesia
Sometimes hallucinations can be temporary. They can happen if you have migraines, a high temperature or just as you wake up or fall asleep.
They can also be caused by an infection, brain tumour or confusion (delirium), especially in older people."
Treatment for hallucinations,"Treatment for hallucinations will depend on what's causing it.
For example, if you have a mental health condition like schizophrenia, you may be given therapy or medicine to help reduce your hallucinations.
A GP may recommend lifestyle changes like drinking less alcohol, not taking drugs and getting more sleep to reduce your hallucinations."
The hamstrings,"The hamstrings are tendons (strong bands of tissue) at the back of the thighs that attach the large thigh muscle to the bone.
The term ""hamstring"" also refers to the group of 3 muscles that run along the back of your thigh, from your hip to just below your knee.
The hamstring muscles are not used much while standing or walking, but they're very active during activities that involve bending the knee, such as running, jumping and climbing."
What causes hamstring injuries?,"A hamstring injury often happens during sudden, powerful movements, such as sprinting, lunging or jumping that overstretch your tendons or muscles. The injury can also happen gradually during slower movements.
Recurring injury is common in athletes and sportsmen, as you're more likely to injure your hamstring if you've injured it before.
Regularly doing stretching and strengthening exercises, and warming up before exercise, may help reduce the risk of injuring your hamstring."
How do I know if I've injured my hamstring?,"Mild hamstring strains (grade 1) will usually cause sudden pain and tenderness at the back of your thigh. It may be painful to move your leg, but the strength of the muscle should not be affected.
Partial hamstring tears (grade 2) are usually more painful and tender. There may also be some swelling and bruising at the back of your thigh and you may have lost some strength in your leg.
Severe hamstring tears (grade 3) will usually be very painful, tender, swollen and bruised, making it difficult to walk and stand. There may have been a ""popping"" sensation at the time of the injury and you'll be unable to use the affected leg."
When to see a GP,"Most hamstring injuries can be cared for at home.
See a GP if you have any concerns about your injury, particularly if you think it's a severe injury, it's not healing, or your symptoms are getting worse.
The GP can also advise you about when you can return to your normal activities and what exercises you should do to aid your recovery in the meantime. They may also refer you for a scan or to a physiotherapist for specialist treatment in some cases."
Rest and recovery from a hamstring injury,"Recovering from a hamstring injury may take days, weeks or months, depending on how severe it is.
A completely torn hamstring may take several months to heal and you'll be unable to resume training or play sport during this time.
Initial treatment
During the first 2 or 3 days, you should care for your injury using RICE therapy:
Rest – rest your leg as much as possible.
Ice – apply cold packs (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to your hamstring for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours during the day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin.
Compression – compress or bandage the thigh to limit any swelling and movement that could cause further damage. You can use a simple elastic bandage or elasticated tubular bandage available from a pharmacy.
Elevation – keep your leg raised and supported on a pillow as much as possible, to help reduce any swelling.
Regular painkillers, such as paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) cream or gel, may also help relieve the pain.
Short-term use of oral NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen tablets, can also help reduce swelling and inflammation. However, these are not suitable for everyone. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if you can take it.
The GP may recommend you wear a knee splint for a brief time. This will help stop your leg moving to help it heal.
Gentle exercises and stretches
Returning to strenuous exercise too quickly could make your injury worse, but avoiding exercise for too long can cause your hamstring muscles to shrink and scar tissue to form around the tear.
To avoid this, you should start doing gentle hamstring stretches after a few days, when the pain has started to subside.
This should be followed by a programme of gentle exercise, such as walking and cycling, and hamstring strengthening exercises.
The GP can give you further advice and, if necessary, refer you to a physiotherapist for a suitable exercise programme.
To avoid injuring yourself again, you should only return to a full level of activity when your hamstring muscles are strong enough. Your physiotherapist or GP will be able to advise you about this.
Many people need to avoid sports for at least a few weeks, but the length of time you need off will depend on the severity of your injury."
What are tendons?,"Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.
When a group of muscles contract (tighten), the attached tendons will pull on certain bones, allowing you to make a wide range of movements.
There are 2 groups of tendons in the hand:
extensor tendons – which run from the forearm across the back of your hand to your fingers and thumb, allowing you to straighten your fingers and thumb
flexor tendons – which run from your forearm through your wrist and across the palm of your hand, allowing you to bend your fingers
Surgery can often be used to repair damage to both these groups of tendons."
When hand tendon repair is needed,"Hand tendon repair is needed when 1 or more tendons in your hand rupture (break or split) or are cut, leading to the loss of normal hand movements.
If your extensor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to straighten 1 or more fingers. If your flexor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to bend 1 or more fingers.
Tendon damage can also cause pain and swelling (inflammation) in your hand.
Sometimes, damage to the extensor tendons can be treated without the need for surgery, using a rigid support called a splint that's worn around the hand.
Common causes of tendon injuries include:
cuts – cuts across the back or palm of your hand can result in injury to your tendons
sports injuries – extensor and flexor tendons can be injured when playing sports like rugby, and the pulleys holding flexor tendons can rupture if you do a lot of strenuous gripping like in rock climbing
animal and human bites – these type of bites can cause tendon damage, and a person may damage their hand tendon after punching another person in the teeth
crushing injuries – jamming a finger in a door or crushing a hand in a car accident can divide or rupture a tendon
rheumatoid arthritis – rheumatoid arthritis can cause tendons to become inflamed which, if severe, can lead to them rupturing"
Tendon repair surgery,"Tendon repair may involve a surgeon making a cut (incision) in your wrist, hand or finger so they can locate the ends of the divided tendon and stitch them together.
Extensor tendons are easier to reach, so repairing them is relatively straightforward.
Read more about how hand tendon repair is performed."
Recovering from surgery,"Both types of tendon surgery require a lengthy period of recovery (rehabilitation) because the repaired tendons will be weak until the ends heal together.
Depending on the location of the injury, it can take up to 3 months for the repaired tendon to regain its previous strength.
Rehabilitation involves protecting your tendons from overuse using a hand splint. You'll usually need to wear a hand splint for several weeks after surgery.
You'll also need to perform hand exercises regularly during your recovery to stop the repaired tendons sticking to nearby tissue, which can prevent you being able to fully move your hand.
When you can return to work will depend on your job. Light activities can often be resumed after 6 to 8 weeks, and heavy activities and sport after 10 to 12 weeks.
Read more about recovering from hand tendon repair."
Results,"After an extensor tendon repair you should have a working finger or thumb, but you may not regain full movement.
The outcome is often better when the injury is a clean cut to the tendon, rather than one that involves crushing or damage to the bones and joints.
A flexor tendon injury is generally more serious because they're often put under more strain than extensor tendons.
After a flexor tendon repair, it's quite common for some fingers to not regain full movement. But the tendon repair will still give a better result than not having surgery.
Complications can sometimes develop after surgery, such as infection or the repaired tendon snapping or sticking to nearby tissue. In these circumstances, further treatment may be required."
"Check if it's hand, foot and mouth disease","The 1st signs of hand, foot and mouth disease can be:
a sore throat
a high temperature
not wanting to eat
The 2nd stage usually starts a few days later and can include:
mouth ulcers, which can be painful
a raised rash of spots on the hands and feet, and sometimes the thighs and bottom
The rash of spots can look pink, red, or darker than the surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone.
The spots can turn into blisters, which might be grey or lighter than surrounding skin and can be painful.
The symptoms are usually the same in adults and children, but can be worse in babies and children under 5.

"How to treat hand, foot and mouth disease yourself","You cannot take antibiotics or medicines to cure hand, foot and mouth disease. It usually gets better on its own in 7 to 10 days.
To help the symptoms:
drink fluids to prevent dehydration and avoid acidic drinks, such as fruit juice
eat soft foods like yoghurt and avoid hot and spicy foods
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease a sore mouth or throat"
"A pharmacist can help with hand, foot and mouth disease","Ask a pharmacist for advice about treatments, such as mouth ulcer gels, sprays and mouthwashes, to relieve pain.
They can tell you which ones are suitable for children."
"How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading","Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once.
You can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start.
To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:
wash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too
use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as quickly as possible
do not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery
wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash
Staying off school or nursery
Keep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling unwell.
But as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed.
Keeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading."
"Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy","Although there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease.
This is because:
having a high temperature during the first 3 months of pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, although this is very rare
getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it
Speak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease."
Check if you have hay fever,"Symptoms of hay fever include:
sneezing and coughing
a runny or blocked nose
itchy, red or watery eyes
itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears
loss of smell
pain around your temples and forehead
headache
earache
feeling tired
If you have asthma, you might also:
have a tight feeling in your chest
be short of breath
wheeze and cough
Hay fever will last for weeks or months, unlike a cold, which usually goes away after 1 to 2 weeks."
How to treat hay fever yourself,"There's currently no cure for hay fever and you cannot prevent it.
But you can do things to ease your symptoms when the pollen count is high.
Do
put Vaseline around your nostrils to trap pollen
wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes
shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash pollen off
stay indoors whenever possible
keep windows and doors shut as much as possible
vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth
buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car and a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter
try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
Don’t
do not cut grass or walk on grass
do not spend too much time outside
do not keep fresh flowers in the house
do not smoke or be around smoke – it makes your symptoms worse
do not dry clothes outside – they can catch pollen
do not let pets into the house if possible – they can carry pollen indoors"
A pharmacist can help with hay fever,"Speak to your pharmacist if you have hay fever.
They can give advice and suggest the best treatments, like antihistamine drops, tablets or nasal sprays to help with:
itchy and watery eyes and sneezing
a blocked nose
Call a pharmacy or contact them online before going in person. You can get medicines delivered or ask someone to collect them.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatments for hay fever from a GP,"Your GP might prescribe a steroid treatment, such as a steroid nasal spray.
If steroids and other hay fever treatments do not work, your GP may refer you for immunotherapy.
This means you'll be given small amounts of pollen as an injection or tablet to slowly build up your immunity to pollen.
This kind of treatment usually starts in the winter about 3 months before the hay fever season begins.
Immunotherapy is a specialist service that may not be available everywhere."
What causes hay fever,"Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen, typically when it comes into contact with your mouth, nose, eyes and throat. Pollen is a fine powder from plants."
Mouth cancer,"Mouth cancer is the most common type of head and neck cancer.
It can affect a number of areas in and around the mouth, including the:
lips
tongue
inside of the cheeks
floor or roof of the mouth
gums
Symptoms of mouth cancer can include mouth ulcers and unexplained, persistent lumps in your mouth, both of which may be painful. 
Read more about mouth cancer."
Laryngeal cancer,"Laryngeal cancer develops in the tissue of the larynx (voice box).
Symptoms of laryngeal cancer can include:
a change in the voice, such as persistent hoarseness
difficulty or pain when swallowing
noisy breathing
shortness of breath
a persistent cough
a lump or swelling in your neck
Read more about laryngeal cancer."
Throat cancers,"Doctors do not tend to use the term ""throat cancer"", as the throat (pharynx) includes many different parts that can be affected by cancer.
The main areas that can be affected are the:
oropharynx – the part of the throat at the back of the mouth
hypopharynx – the part of the throat connecting the oropharynx to the gullet and windpipe
nasopharynx – the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth
The most common symptoms of cancer in the oropharynx or hypopharynx include a lump in the neck, a persistent sore throat and difficulty swallowing.

Salivary gland cancer,"Salivary glands produce saliva, which keeps your mouth moist and helps with swallowing and digestion.
There are 3 main pairs of salivary glands. They are the:
parotid glands – located between your cheeks and your ears
sublingual glands – located under your tongue
submandibular glands – located under each side of your jawbone
Salivary gland cancer most commonly affects the parotid glands.
The main symptom of salivary gland cancer is a lump or swelling on or near your jaw, or in your mouth or neck. But most of these lumps are non-cancerous.
Other symptoms can include numbness in part of your face and drooping on one side of your face.

Nasal and sinus cancer,"Nasal and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (above the roof of your mouth) and the sinuses (the small, air-filled cavities inside the bones of the nose and within the cheekbones and forehead).
The symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are similar to viral or bacterial infections, such as the common cold or sinusitis, and include:
a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects 1 side
nosebleeds
a decreased sense of smell
mucus running from the nose or down the throat
Read more about nasal and sinus cancer."
Nasopharyngeal cancer,"Nasopharyngeal cancer affects the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It's one of the rarest types of head and neck cancer in the UK.
Symptoms can include:
a lump in the neck, due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes (small glands that are part of the immune system) in the neck
a blocked or stuffy nose
nosebleeds
hearing loss (usually only in 1 ear)

Check if it's head lice,"Head lice are small insects, up to 3mm long.
Credit:
They can be difficult to spot in your hair.
Credit:
Head lice eggs (nits) are brown or white (empty shells) and attached to the hair.
Credit:
Head lice can make your head feel:
itchy
like something is moving in your hair
The only way to be sure someone has head lice is by finding live lice.
You can do this by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb (detection comb). You can buy these online or at pharmacies."
How to get rid of head lice,"Treat head lice as soon as you spot them. You can treat head lice without seeing a GP.
You should check everyone in the house and start treating anyone who has head lice on the same day.
There's no need to keep your child off school if they have head lice.
Wet combing
Lice and nits can be removed by wet combing.
You can buy a special fine-toothed comb (detection comb) online or from pharmacies to remove head lice and nits.
There may be instructions on the pack, but usually you:
wash hair with ordinary shampoo
apply lots of conditioner (any conditioner will do)
comb the whole head of hair, from the roots to the ends
It usually takes about 10 minutes to comb short hair, and 20 to 30 minutes for long, frizzy or curly hair.
Do wet combing on days 1, 5, 9 and 13 to catch any newly hatched head lice. Check again that everyone's hair is free of lice on day 17.
Medicated lotions and sprays
If wet combing has not worked or is not suitable, you could try a medicated lotion or spray. These kill head lice in all types of hair, and you can buy them from pharmacies, supermarkets or online.
Head lice should die within a day. Some lotions and sprays come with a comb to remove dead lice and eggs.
Some treatments need to be repeated after a week to kill any newly hatched lice.
Check the pack to see if they're OK for you or your child and how to use them.
If lotions or sprays do not work, speak to a pharmacist about other treatments.
Some treatments are not recommended because they're unlikely to work.
For example:
products containing permethrin
head lice ""repellents""
electric combs for head lice
tree and plant oil treatments, such as tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil and lavender oil herbal remedies"
You cannot prevent head lice,"There's nothing you can do to prevent head lice.
You can help stop them spreading by wet or dry combing regularly to catch them early.
Do not use medicated lotions and sprays to prevent head lice. They can irritate the scalp.
There's no need for children to stay off school or to wash laundry on a hot wash."
How you can ease headaches yourself,"Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.
Do
drink plenty of water
get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu
try to relax – stress can make headaches worse
take paracetamol or ibuprofen
try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)
do not sleep more than you usually would – it can make the headache worse
do not strain your eyes for a long time – for example, by looking at a screen"
What can cause headaches,"The most common reasons are:
having a cold or flu
stress
drinking too much alcohol
bad posture
eyesight problems
not eating regular meals
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration)
taking too many painkillers
having your period or during menopause"
Signs of hormone headaches,"It's worth keeping a diary for at least 3 menstrual cycles to help you check whether your migraines are linked to your periods.
If they're linked, a diary can help to pinpoint at what stage in your cycle you get a migraine.
The Migraine Trust website has a downloadable headache diary, which may be a useful tool."
Self-help tips for hormone headaches,"If keeping a diary reveals that your headaches develop just before your period, you can try these tips to help prevent a migraine:
Eat small, frequent snacks to keep your blood sugar level up. Missing meals or going too long without food can trigger attacks. Have a small snack before going to bed, and always eat breakfast.
Have a regular sleep pattern, and avoid too much or too little sleep. Insomnia usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits.
Avoid stress. If this proves difficult, find ways to deal with stress, such as taking regular exercise and using relaxation strategies. Use these 10 stress busters"
Treatments for hormone headaches,"Migraine treatments
Your doctor can also prescribe migraine medicines for you to take around the time of your period.
These do not contain hormones, but they can help stop the headaches developing.
They include tablets called triptans and a type of painkiller called mefenamic acid.
Continuous contraceptive pills
Talk to your doctor if you think your contraceptive pills are making your migraines worse.
If you have headaches during the days you do not take the pills, you can avoid the sudden fall in oestrogen by taking several packs continuously without a break.
Find out more about the combined contraceptive pill
Hormone replacement therapy
The hormone changes that happen as women approach the menopause mean that all types of headache, including migraines, become more common.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be helpful to treat hot flushes and sweats.
But if you have migraines, it's best to use patches or a gel, as these types of HRT keep hormone levels more stable than tablets and are less likely to trigger migraines.
Oestrogen therapy
If you have regular periods, a doctor can prescribe an oestrogen gel or patch, which you use before your period is due and for a few days during your period.
But these are not commonly prescribed for hormone headaches."
Check if it's a tension headache,"Common symptoms of tension headaches include:
pain on both sides of your head, face or neck
feeling like something is pressing on your head or being tightened around it
the affected area may feel tender and your head may hurt more when touched
You should be able to continue doing daily activities without making the headache worse.
Tension headaches last at least 30 minutes but they can last much longer, sometimes for several days."
Causes of tension headaches,"Common causes of tension headaches include:
stress
sleep problems
caffeine
Taking painkillers for headaches too often or for a long time can also cause headaches. These are known as overuse or rebound headaches.
Tension headaches are not a sign of an underlying condition."
How to ease a tension headache,"There are some things you can do to treat a tension headache yourself.
Do
use painkillers like paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen – paracetamol is the first choice of painkiller if you're pregnant, and children under 16 should not take aspirin
try doing activities to help you relax like exercise, yoga and massage
try changing your sleeping habits if sleep problems like insomnia may be causing your headaches
try using a low, firm pillow and heat or cold packs if you have neck pain and headaches
try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
Don’t
do not have, or cut down on, drinks with caffeine in them like tea, coffee or cola
A pharmacist can help with headaches
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take, if you're not sure which is suitable for you
what to do if you're pregnant – some medicines (like ibuprofen) are not recommended in pregnancy
medicines for sleep problems like insomnia if you're having trouble sleeping and you think it may be causing your headaches
Find a pharmacy"
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have regular tension headaches, a GP may suggest you keep a headache diary to record details of your headaches like:
how often you get them and how long they last
how painful they are and any other symptoms you have
possible causes
any medicines you take to help
The GP may advise you about taking painkillers for tension headaches, such as when to take medicine and how often you should take it.
You may be referred to a specialist if painkillers and activities like exercise do not help reduce your headaches or if it's not clear what's causing them."
Preventing tension headaches,"If you get tension headaches regularly, you may be offered a course of acupuncture.
An antidepressant medicine called amitriptyline is also sometimes recommended to help prevent tension headaches.
You'll be prescribed a low-dose to start with, which may later be increased. The medicine usually needs to be taken for several months before it starts working."
Check if you have health anxiety,"You may have health anxiety if you:
constantly worry about your health
frequently check your body for signs of illness, such as lumps, tingling or pain
are always asking people for reassurance that you're not ill
worry that a doctor or medical tests may have missed something
obsessively look at health information on the internet or in the media
avoid anything to do with serious illness, such as medical TV programmes
act as if you were ill (for example, avoiding physical activities)
Anxiety itself can cause symptoms like headaches or a racing heartbeat, and you may mistake these for signs of illness."
Self-help for health anxiety,"Keep a diary
Note how often you check your body, ask people for reassurance, or look at health information.
Try to gradually reduce how often you do these things over a week.
Challenge your thoughts
Draw a table with 2 columns.
Write your health worries in the 1st column, then more balanced thoughts in the 2nd. For example, in the 1st column you may write, ""I'm worried about these headaches"" and in the 2nd, ""Headaches can often be a sign of stress"".
Keep busy with other things
When you get the urge to check your body, for example, distract yourself by going for a walk or calling a friend.
Get back to normal activities
Try to gradually start doing things you've been avoiding because of your health worries, such as sports or socialising.
Try to relax
Try breathing exercises for stress or visit the Mind website for some relaxation exercises."
Treatment for health anxiety,"If a GP diagnoses you with health anxiety, they may refer you for a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), or offer you a medicine for anxiety.
You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
Find an NHS talking therapies service
If you can afford it, you can choose to pay for your therapy privately. The cost of private therapy sessions varies, but it can cost from £35 upwards per session.

Benefits of hearing aids,"Hearing aids will not make your hearing perfect, but they make sounds louder and clearer, reducing the impact hearing loss has on your life.
Hearing aids can:
help you hear everyday sounds such as the doorbell and phone
improve your ability to hear speech
make you feel more confident when talking to people and make it easier for you to follow conversations in different environments
help you to enjoy listening to music and the TV, at a volume that's comfortable for those around you
But hearing aids only help if you still have some hearing left, so do not put off getting help if your hearing is getting worse."
How to get hearing aids,"See a GP if you're having problems with your hearing. They may refer you to a hearing specialist for an assessment if they think you might need a hearing aid.
If your specialist recommends hearing aids, talk to them about the different types available and which is best for you. You may be able to try a few types before choosing.
Some types may be available to use straight away. Others may need to be custom made after your ear has been measured or a cast of your ear has been taken. These will usually be ready in a few weeks.
When your hearing aid is ready, it will be programmed to suit your level of hearing loss. You'll be shown how to use it and how to look after it.
Another appointment will be arranged for a few weeks later to check how things are going."
Types of hearing aids,"A variety of hearing aids are available.
Behind the ear (BTE) hearing aids
Receiver in the ear (RITE) hearing aids
In the ear (ITE) hearing aids
In the canal (ITC) hearing aids
Completely in the canal (CIC) and invisible in the canal (IIC) hearing aids
CROS and BiCROS hearing aids
Body worn hearing aids"
Hearing aids on the NHS,"Hearing aids are available on the NHS.
Your GP can refer you to an NHS hearing aid provider if they think you might need a hearing aid.
The benefits of getting a hearing aid on the NHS include:
hearing aids are provided for free as a long-term loan
batteries and repairs are free (there may be a charge if you lose or break your hearing aid and it needs to be replaced)
you do not have to pay for any follow-up appointments or aftercare
But while several modern hearing aids are available on the NHS, these are usually the behind the ear (BTE) or, very occasionally, the receiver in the ear (RITE) type. You may need to pay for private treatment if you want one of the other types.
The waiting time for getting a hearing aid on the NHS can sometimes be longer than the wait for private treatment."
Paying for hearing aids,"If you do not mind paying for treatment, you can choose to go to a private hearing aid provider directly.
This may mean you can pick from a wider range of hearing aids, including the smaller, less visible models.
Not all hearing aids are suitable for everyone, but the hearing specialist (audiologist) will tell you which hearing aids are suitable within your budget.
If you choose to pay for private treatment:
make sure you research typical costs of hearing aids and any aftercare – you can pay anything from £500 to £3,500 or more for a single hearing aid
shop around to see what types of hearing aid are available from different providers
consider the cost of batteries and if you can change them easily"
"Batteries, repairs and replacements","If you have an NHS hearing aid, you can get free batteries and repairs from the NHS hearing aid service who fitted your hearing aids.
Ask your audiologist about how to obtain batteries and request servicing and repairs.
You may need to come in for an appointment, or you may be able to send off for batteries or a repair in the post.
Your local hearing aid service can also replace hearing aids that have been lost or damaged, although there may be a charge for this.
If you have a private hearing aid, contact your hearing aid provider if you need it repaired or replaced.
You may have to pay for this service if it's not already included in your payment plan."
Help and support if you wear hearing aids,"Adjusting to hearing aids can be difficult at first. It may take a few weeks or months to get used to them.
You'll have follow-up appointments after they're fitted to check how things are going, but get in touch with your audiologist at any point if you're having problems.
Several hearing loss organisations can also provide help and support if you're adapting to hearing loss or life with a hearing aid.
Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) has information about local support services
Other organisations that can provide information and advice include:
Hearing Link Services
National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS)"
Hearing implants,"For some people, hearing aids do not help and instead they need to have a special device fitted inside or to their skull during an operation. These are known as hearing implants.
Common types of implant include bone anchored hearing aids, cochlear implants, auditory brainstem implants and middle ear implants.
Bone anchored hearing aids
Cochlear implants
Auditory brainstem implants
Middle ear implants"
Assistive listening devices (ALDs),"There are many sorts of listening devices, other than hearing aids, to help boost your hearing in everyday situations in the home and out and about.
Assistive listening devices (ALDs), which can be used with a hearing aid or on their own, include:
personal hearing loops, like neckloops, that allow you to hear music or phone calls directly through your hearing aid
personal communicators (or conversation listeners): portable devices to help you hear over a long distance or in noisy places
TV amplifiers: devices that allow you to hear sound clearly through your hearing aid without needing to turn up the volume
smoke alarms appropriate for your level of hearing, such as vibrating devices
Your GP or hearing specialist will tell you about organisations that provide advice on obtaining ALDs, such as:
social services
fire service
Access to Work government programme – find out more on GOV.UK
Disabled Students' Allowance government programme – find out more on GOV.UK"
How to get an NHS hearing test,"You can get a free hearing test on the NHS. A GP may refer you to a hearing specialist (audiologist) who can do the test.
It could take a few weeks to see a specialist so it might be quicker to get tested somewhere else, like at a large pharmacy or opticians. This is often free.
Important
Always see a GP first if:
you also have other symptoms, like earache or discharge – this could be something easily treatable like an earwax build-up or ear infection
you have sudden hearing loss in one ear
you're worried about your child's hearing"
Other ways to get a hearing test,"Online hearing test
There are simple hearing tests online.
This can tell you if you need to have a face-to-face hearing test.
Check your hearing with the RNID's free online hearing test
Pharmacies and opticians
Lots of large pharmacies and opticians can do hearing tests.
The test is often free, but you'll normally have to pay for any treatment you might need (such as hearing aids).
What happens during a hearing test"
Why hearing tests are important,"Hearing tests carried out soon after birth can help identify most babies with significant hearing loss, and testing later in childhood can pick up any problems that have been missed or have been slowly getting worse.
Without routine hearing tests, there's a chance that a hearing problem could go undiagnosed for many months or even years.
It's important to identify hearing problems as early as possible because they can affect your child's speech and language development, social skills and education.
Treatment is more effective if any problems are detected and managed accordingly early on. An early diagnosis will also help ensure you and your child have access to any special support services you may need."
When will my child's hearing be checked?,"Your child's hearing may be checked:
Within a few weeks of birth – this is known as newborn hearing screening and it's often carried out before you leave hospital after giving birth. This is routine for all children and even those having a home birth will be invited to come to hospital to have this.
From 9 months to 2.5 years of age – you may be asked whether you have any concerns about your child's hearing as part of your baby's health and development reviews, and hearing tests can be arranged if necessary.
At around 4 or 5 years old – some children will have a hearing test when they start school, this may be conducted at school or an audiology department depending upon where you live.
Your child's hearing can also be checked at any other time if you have any concerns. Speak to a GP or health visitor if you're worried about your child's hearing."
Newborn hearing screening,"Newborn babies can be screened for any potential hearing problems using 2 quick and painless tests. The tests are normally conducted on the ward before you leave hospital.
Read more about newborn hearing screening"
Hearing tests for older babies and children,"A number of different hearing tests may be used to check for hearing problems in older babies and young children. These are usually undertaken at an audiology department.
Some of the main tests that may be carried out are described on this page.
Visual reinforcement audiometry
Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is usually used to test hearing in children from approximately 6 months of age up to 2.5 years old.
During the test, your child will sit on your lap or a chair while sounds are presented. Your baby will be taught to link the sound to a visual reward such as a toy or computer screen lighting up.
Once your child is able to associate the sound and the visual reward the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.
Play audiometry
Young children between 1.5 and 5 years old may have a play audiometry test.
During the test, sounds will be played through headphones or speakers and your child will be asked to perform a simple task when they hear the sound. This may vary from putting a ball in a bucket to completing a puzzle.
As with VRA, the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.
Pure tone audiometry
Older children may have a test called pure tone audiometry. This is the test often used to screen a child's hearing before they start school, when it is sometimes referred to as the ""sweep test"". It's similar to a hearing test an adult might have.
During pure tone audiometry, a machine generates sounds at different volumes and frequencies. The sounds are played through headphones and your child is asked to respond when they hear them by pressing a button.
By changing the level of the sound, the tester can work out the quietest sounds your child can hear.
Bone conduction test
In addition to using speakers or headphones, most of the tests above can also be carried out using a small vibrating device placed behind the ear.
This device passes sound directly to the inner ear through the bones in the head, which can help identify which part of the ear is not working properly if your child is having hearing problems.
Tympanometry
Tympanometry is a test to assess how flexible the eardrum is.
For good hearing, your eardrum needs to be flexible to allow sound to pass through it. If the eardrum is too rigid – for example, because there is fluid behind it (glue ear) – sounds will bounce back off the eardrum instead of passing through it.
During the test, a soft rubber tube will be placed at the entrance of your child's ear. Air is gently blown down the tube and a sound is played through a small speaker inside it. The tube then measures the sound that's bounced back from the ear."
Causes of hearing problems in babies and children,"There are a number of reasons why a child may have a hearing problem, including temporary hearing loss from a common illness such as a common cold.
Some possible causes of hearing loss that may be detected during routine tests include:
glue ear – a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which is common in young children
infections that develop in the womb or at birth, such as rubella (german measles) or cytomegalovirus, which can cause progressive hearing loss
inherited conditions which stop the ears or nerves from working properly
damage to the cochlear or auditory nerves (which transmit hearing signals to the brain); this could be caused by a severe head injury, exposure to loud noise or head surgery, for example
being starved of oxygen at birth (birth asphyxia)
illnesses such as meningitis and encephalitis (which both involve swelling in the brain)"
Spotting signs of a hearing problem,"Although your child will be offered routine hearing tests as they grow up, it's still important for you to look out for signs of any problems and seek advice if you have any concerns.
For babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check your child's hearing as they grow up.
In older children, signs of a possible hearing problem can include:
inattentiveness or poor concentration
not responding when their name is called
talking loudly and listening to the television at a high volume
difficulty pinpointing where a sound is coming from
mispronouncing words
a change in their progress at school
Speak to a GP or health visitor if you're concerned about your child's hearing. Your child can have a hearing test at any age."
Symptoms of a heart attack,"Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances."
Treating heart attacks,"While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on the type of heart attack, and how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart"
Causes of a heart attack,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels (coronary arteries) that supply the heart muscle become clogged by a build-up of deposits of fatty substances, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack."
Recovering from a heart attack,"The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack"
Complications of a heart attack,"Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. Some types can stop the heart beating
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Some people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack. But with treatment many people survive a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
general health
Find out more about complications of a heart attack"
Preventing a heart attack,"There are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption"
Symptoms of heart block,"1st-degree heart block
1st-degree heart block does not usually cause any symptoms. Most people only find out they have it when they're tested for an unrelated medical condition.
2nd-degree heart block
Most people with the less serious type of 2nd-degree heart block, known as Mobitz type 1, do not have any symptoms. But some people may feel:
lightheaded or dizzy
faint
People with the more serious type of 2nd-degree heart block, known as Mobitz type 2 heart block, are more likely to have Mobitz type 1 symptoms as well as:
chest pain
shortness of breath
feeling very dizzy suddenly when standing up from a lying or sitting position – this is caused by having low blood pressure (hypotension)
3rd-degree heart block
Symptoms of 3rd-degree or complete heart block include:
feeling faint
being short of breath
extreme tiredness, sometimes with confusion
chest pain
Call 999 if your symptoms are severe or come on very quickly. These symptoms can be life threatening."
Causes of heart block,"Some people are born with heart block – known as congenital heart block.
But more commonly, heart block develops later in life. This is known as acquired heart block and can be caused by:
other heart conditions, such as a heart attack
some prescription medicines
other conditions, such as Lyme disease
having heart surgery
Babies are more likely to have congenital heart block if they're born with a heart defect, or if their mother has an autoimmune condition, such as lupus."
Treatment of heart block,"Heart block normally only needs to be treated if it's causing symptoms.
Depending on the cause of heart block and your symptoms, you may need to have a small device called a pacemaker fitted in your chest. A pacemaker is a small battery-operated device inserted under the skin of your chest. It sends frequent electrical pulses to keep your heart beating regularly.
Read more about how a pacemaker is fitted
Treatment for heart block usually works well. Most people live a normal active life with a pacemaker."
Diagnosing heart block,"Unless you're experiencing symptoms, heart block is often diagnosed during routine tests for other conditions.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main test used to diagnose heart block. It measures the electrical activity of your heart.
An ECG can be carried out at rest or while you're exercising. Your doctor may ask you to wear a portable ECG monitor to get a reading over time. It provides a useful overall assessment of how well your heart is working.
The results of an ECG can also sometimes indicate the type of heart block you have."
Symptoms of heart failure,"The main symptoms of heart failure are:
breathlessness after activity or at rest
feeling tired most of the time and finding exercise exhausting
feeling lightheaded or fainting
swollen ankles and legs
Some people also experience other symptoms, such as a persistent cough, a fast heart rate and dizziness.
Symptoms can develop quickly (acute heart failure) or gradually over weeks or months (chronic heart failure)."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you experience persistent or gradually worsening symptoms of heart failure.
Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E department as soon as possible if you have sudden or very severe symptoms.
A number of tests can be used to help check how well your heart is working, including blood tests, an ECG and an echocardiogram.
Find out more about how heart failure is diagnosed"
Causes of heart failure,"Heart failure is often the result of a number of problems affecting the heart at the same time.
Conditions that can lead to heart failure include:
coronary heart disease – where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up with fatty substances (atherosclerosis), which may cause angina or a heart attack
high blood pressure – this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure
conditions affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation
damage or other problems with the heart valves
congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart
Sometimes obesity, anaemia, drinking too much alcohol, an overactive thyroid or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure."
Treatments for heart failure,"Treatment for heart failure usually aims to control the symptoms for as long as possible and slow down the progression of the condition.
How you're treated will depend on what is causing your heart failure.
Common treatments include:
lifestyle changes – including eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking
medicine – a range of medicines can help; many people need to take 2 or 3 different types
devices implanted in your chest – these can help control your heart rhythm
surgery – such as a bypass operation or a heart transplant
Treatment will usually be needed for life.
A cure may be possible when heart failure has a treatable cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, replacing or repairing them may cure the condition."
Outlook for heart failure,"Heart failure is a serious long-term condition that will usually continue to get slowly worse over time.
It can severely limit the activities you're able to do and is often eventually fatal.
But it's very difficult to tell how the condition will progress on an individual basis.
It's very unpredictable. Lots of people remain stable for many years, while in some cases it may get worse quickly."
Why heart transplants are carried out,"A heart transplant may be considered if you have severe heart failure and medical treatments are not helping.
Conditions that may eventually require a heart transplant include:
coronary heart disease – a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries supplying the heart, which block or interrupt blood flow to the heart
cardiomyopathy – where the walls of the heart have become stretched, thickened or stiff
congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart
If your doctor thinks you might benefit from a heart transplant, you'll need to have an in-depth assessment to check whether you're healthy enough to have one before being placed on a waiting list.
Read more about who can have a heart transplant and being on the heart transplant waiting list."
What happens during a heart transplant,"A heart transplant needs to be carried out as soon as possible after a donor heart becomes available.
The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep.
While it's carried out, a heart-lung bypass machine will be used to keep your blood circulating with oxygen-rich blood.
A cut is made in the middle of the chest. Your own heart is then removed, and the donor heart is connected to the main arteries and veins. The new heart should then begin beating normally.
Find out more about what happens during a heart transplant"
Recovering from a heart transplant,"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for 2 to 4 weeks after a heart transplant.
Most people are able to start returning to many of their normal activities within a few months.
Your transplant team can give you advice about how long you may need to avoid certain activities during your recovery.
You'll need to have regular check-ups with your transplant team after the transplant.
You'll also need to take medicines called immunosuppressants for the rest of your life. 
Without these medicines, your body may recognise your new heart as foreign and attack it (rejection).
Find out more about living with a heart transplant"
Risks of a heart transplant,"A heart transplant is a complex and risky procedure.
Possible complications include:
the immune system recognising the transplanted heart as foreign and attacking it (rejection)
the donated heart failing to work properly (such as primary graft dysfunction)
narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart (cardiac allograft vasculopathy)
side effects from the immunosuppressant medication, such as an increased vulnerability to infections, weight gain and kidney problems
Many of these problems are treatable, although sometimes another heart transplant may need to be carried out if possible.
Find out more about the risks associated with a heart transplant"
Outlook for heart transplants,"Most people can eventually return to their normal activities after a heart transplant and experience a significant improvement in their symptoms for many years.
But it's a major operation and some of the complications can be life threatening.
Overall:
80 to 90 in every 100 people will live at least a year
70 to 75 in every 100 people will live at least 5 years
In the UK, people who have had a heart transplant live for an average of 14 years, but this depends on things like age and general health."

Mitral valve prolapse,"Mitral valve prolapse is where the mitral valve is too floppy and does not close tightly.
Symptoms
Many people with a mitral valve prolapse do not have symptoms and it may only be spotted during a heart scan (echocardiogram) carried out for another reason.
Mitral valve prolapse can sometimes cause:
dizziness
breathlessness
tiredness
an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)
mitral regurgitation
Treatment
You probably will not need treatment if you do not have any symptoms.
Your doctor may suggest:
making lifestyle changes, such as giving up smoking, caffeine and alcohol – these things can make your heart work too hard
having regular check-ups to monitor your condition
If you have symptoms or your mitral valve is very floppy, your doctor may recommend:
medicine to relieve your symptoms, such as beta blockers for an irregular heartbeat
mitral valve surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve
Causes
Mitral valve prolapse is usually caused by problems with the tissues that join the mitral valve to the heart muscles.
Some people with the condition are born with it, and it's more common in people with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome.
Rarely, it can be caused by damage to the heart muscles themselves – for example, as the result of a heart attack."
Mitral regurgitation,"Mitral regurgitation is where some blood flows the wrong way in the heart because the mitral valve does not close properly.
Symptoms
Mitral valve regurgitation does not always have symptoms.
Sometimes it can cause:
dizziness
breathlessness
tiredness
chest pain
If not treated, it can lead to:
atrial fibrillation – an irregular and fast heartbeat
pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs
heart failure – where the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body
Treatment
You might not need treatment if you do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may just suggest having regular check-ups to monitor your condition.
If you have symptoms or the problem with your valve is serious, your doctor may recommend:
medicines to relieve your symptoms – such as diuretics to reduce breathlessness and medicines for atrial fibrillation
open heart surgery – to repair or replace the mitral valve
keyhole surgery – a small clip is attached to the mitral valve to help it close; the clip is guided into the heart through a thin tube inserted into a vein in the groin
Causes
Mitral regurgitation happens if the mitral valve cannot close properly.
This is usually caused by either:
the mitral valve becoming too floppy (mitral valve prolapse)
the ring of muscle around the valve becoming too wide
These problems often develop with age – for example, because of ""wear and tear"" over time or damage caused by untreated high blood pressure.
Mitral regurgitation can sometimes be caused by a problem such as:
cardiomyopathy – where the walls of the heart become stretched, thickened or stiff
endocarditis – infection of the inner lining of the heart
congenital heart disease – birth defects affecting the heart"
Mitral stenosis,"Mitral valve stenosis is where the mitral valve does not open as wide as it should, restricting the flow of blood through the heart.
Symptoms
Mitral valve stenosis may not have any symptoms.
Sometimes it can cause:
dizziness
breathlessness
tiredness
noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)
chest pain
If not treated, it can lead to:
atrial fibrillation – an irregular and fast heartbeat
pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs
heart failure – where the heart cannot pump blood around the body properly
Treatment
You might not need treatment if you do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may just suggest having regular check-ups to monitor your condition.
If you have symptoms or the problem with your valve is serious, your doctor may recommend:
medicine to relieve your symptoms – such as medicines called diuretics to reduce breathlessness and medicines for atrial fibrillation
mitral valve surgery – to replace the valve or a procedure to stretch it with a small balloon (balloon valvuloplasty)
Causes
One of the main causes of mitral valve stenosis is rheumatic heart disease.
This is where an infection causes the heart to become inflamed. Over time, it can cause the flaps of the mitral valve to become hard and thick.
Other causes include hard deposits that form around the valve with age, or a problem with the heart from birth (congenital heart disease)."
Mitral valve surgery,"Mitral valve surgery may be recommended if you have symptoms caused by a problem with your mitral valve or if the problem is quite serious.
The most common mitral valve procedures are:
mitral valve repair
mitral valve replacement
balloon valvuloplasty – where the mitral valve is stretched with a small balloon
Mitral valve repair
Mitral valve repair is an operation to make the flaps of the mitral valve stay closer together. This will help stop blood flowing the wrong way through the valve.
It's mainly used to treat mitral valve prolapse or regurgitation, if the problem is serious and causing symptoms.
The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. 
Your surgeon will usually get to your heart through a single cut along the middle of your chest, but smaller cuts between your ribs are sometimes used.
The flaps of the mitral valve are then partially sewn together.
The operation may be done as keyhole surgery, where a small clip is attached to the mitral valve to help it close.
Most people experience a significant improvement in their symptoms after surgery, but speak to your surgeon about the possible complications.
Mitral valve replacement
Mitral valve replacement is an operation to replace your mitral valve with a mechanical valve or a valve made from animal tissue (a bioprosthetic valve).
This is usually only done if you have mitral stenosis or mitral prolapse or regurgitation and are unable to have a valve repair.
The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. Your surgeon will usually replace the valve through a single cut along the middle of your chest.
Most people experience a significant improvement in their symptoms after surgery, but speak to your surgeon about the possible complications. The risk of serious problems is generally higher than with mitral valve repair.
You'll also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots for a long time after this operation. If you have a mechanical valve, you'll need to take this medicine for life.
Balloon valvuloplasty
Balloon valvuloplasty, also called percutaneous mitral commissurotomy, is a procedure that can be used to widen the mitral valve if you have mitral stenosis.
It's usually done using local anaesthetic, where you remain awake but your skin is numbed.
A small cut is made in your groin or neck and a thin tube is passed along a blood vessel to your heart.
The end of the catheter has a small balloon attached to it. This is inflated inside the narrowed valve to stretch it wider. The balloon is then deflated and removed along with the catheter.
This procedure is generally less effective than replacing the mitral valve, but recovery tends to be quicker and it may be a better option if your valve is not too narrow or you're at an increased risk of surgery complications (for example, if you're pregnant or frail)."
Check for signs of heat exhaustion,"The signs of heat exhaustion include:
tiredness
dizziness
headache
feeling sick or being sick
excessive sweating and skin becoming pale and clammy or getting a heat rash, but a change in skin colour can be harder to see on brown and black skin
cramps in the arms, legs and stomach
fast breathing or heartbeat
a high temperature
being very thirsty
weakness
The symptoms of heat exhaustion are often the same in adults and children, although children may become irritable too.
If someone is showing signs of heat exhaustion they need to be cooled down and given fluids."
Things you can do to cool someone down,"If someone has heat exhaustion, follow these 4 steps:
Move them to a cool place.
Remove all unnecessary clothing like a jacket or socks.
Get them to drink a sports or rehydration drink, or cool water.
Cool their skin – spray or sponge them with cool water and fan them. Cold packs, wrapped in a cloth and put under the armpits or on the neck are good too.
Stay with them until they're better.
They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes."
Preventing heat exhaustion and heatstroke,"There's a high risk of heat exhaustion or heatstroke during hot weather or exercise.
To help prevent heat exhaustion or heatstroke:
drink more cold drinks, especially if you're active or exercising
wear light-coloured, loose clothing
avoid the sun between 11am and 3pm
avoid excess alcohol
avoid extreme exercise
if you're inside on a very hot day, close curtains, close windows if it's hotter outside than in your home and turn off electrical equipment and lights that get hot
This will also prevent dehydration and help your body keep itself cool.
Children, older people and people with long-term health conditions (such as diabetes or heart problems) are more at risk of heat exhaustion or heatstroke.
Read more about what do to and how to cope in hot weather."
Check if you have heat rash,"The symptoms of heat rash are:
small, raised spots
an itchy, prickly feeling
mild swelling
The rash often looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin.
The symptoms of heat rash are often the same in adults and children.
It can appear anywhere on the body and spread, but it cannot be passed on to other people.
Heat rash appears as raised spots that are 2mm to 4mm across. Some spots may be filled with fluid.
Credit:"
How you can treat or prevent heat rash yourself,"The main thing to do is keep your skin cool so you do not sweat and irritate the rash.
To keep your skin cool
wear loose cotton clothing
use lightweight bedding
take cool baths or showers
drink plenty of fluid to avoid dehydration
To calm the itching or prickly feeling
apply something cold, such as a damp cloth or ice pack (wrapped in a tea towel) for up to 20 minutes
tap or pat the rash instead of scratching it
do not use perfumed shower gels or creams"
A pharmacist can help with heat rash,"Speak to a pharmacist about heat rash. They can give advice and suggest the best treatment to use.
A pharmacist might recommend:
calamine lotion
antihistamine tablets
hydrocortisone cream – though not for children under 10 or pregnant women as they need to get advice from a doctor before using this treatment"
Causes of heat rash,"Heat rash is usually caused by excessive sweating.
Sweat glands get blocked and the trapped sweat leads to a rash developing a few days later.
Babies often get heat rash because they cannot control their temperature as well as adults and children can."
Check if you have heavy periods,"You may have heavy periods if you:
need to change your pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours, or empty your menstrual cup more often than is recommended
need to use 2 types of sanitary product together, such as a pad and a tampon
have periods lasting more than 7 days
pass blood clots larger than about 2.5cm (the size of a 10p coin)
bleed through to your clothes or bedding
avoid daily activities, like exercise, or take time off work because of your periods
feel tired or short of breath a lot"
Causes of heavy periods,"It can be normal to have heavy periods.
They can sometimes be heavy at different times, like when you first start your periods, after pregnancy or during menopause.
Sometimes, they can be caused by:
conditions affecting your womb, ovaries or hormones, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis and pelvic inflammatory disease
some medicines and treatments, including some anticoagulant medicines and chemotherapy medicines
stress and depression
Rarely, heavy periods can be a sign of womb cancer."
Treatment for heavy periods,"Heavy periods do not always need to be treated. But there are treatments that can help if they’re affecting your daily life.
Treatments from a GP include:
some types of contraception, such as an intrauterine system (IUS) or the combined contraceptive pill
medicine to help reduce the bleeding, such as tranexamic acid
prescription-only anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as mefenamic acid or naproxen
You should have a blood test to check if you have iron deficiency anaemia.
If these treatments do not work or a GP thinks a condition may be causing your heavy periods, they’ll usually refer you for tests or to see a specialist."
How to ease heel pain yourself,"If you see a GP, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest and raise your heel when you can
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on your heel for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
wear wide comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
use soft insoles or heel pads in your shoes
wrap a bandage around your heel and ankle to support it
try regular gentle stretching exercises
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
Don’t
do not walk or stand for long periods, especially barefoot
do not wear high heels or tight pointy shoes
A pharmacist can help with heel pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take for your heel pain
insoles and pads for your shoes
treatments for common skin problems that can affect the heel
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Common causes of heel pain,"Heel pain is often caused by exercising too much or wearing shoes that are too tight.
Your symptoms might also give you an idea of what's causing your heel pain.
Possible causes of heel pain.

Check if it's Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP),"The main symptom of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rash with raised red or purple spots. The spots look like small bruises or blood spots.
The rash usually appears on the legs, bottom, tummy, chest or back.
Credit:
There may be lots of spots or just a few.
Credit:
You may also have pain or swelling in your joints, such as your knees and ankles. You may also have tummy pain.
Credit:"
Treatments for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP),"There's no treatment for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). It usually gets better in a few weeks and you can usually just rest at home until you feel better.
HSP cannot spread to others, so:
your child can return to school or nursery when they feel well enough
you can go back to work as soon as you feel up to it
Treatment to relieve your symptoms
Paracetamol can help ease any pain.
Do not take ibuprofen without speaking to your doctor because it could harm your kidneys.
Regular check-ups for kidney problems
You'll have regular check-ups for 6 to 12 months to check how well your kidneys are working.
You'll usually be asked to provide a sample of pee and have your blood pressure checked at each appointment. This may be done at home, at your GP surgery, or in hospital.
Treatment in hospital
You may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys.
In hospital, you may be given strong medicines like steroids to help ease your symptoms."
Risks of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP),"Most people with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment.
But sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months.
There's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged (chronic kidney disease). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups.
Important:
Getting HSP again
You can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back."
Symptoms of hepatitis,"Short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it.
If symptoms do develop, they can include:
muscle and joint pain
a high temperature
feeling and being sick
feeling unusually tired all the time
a general sense of feeling unwell
loss of appetite
tummy pain
dark urine
pale, grey-coloured poo
itchy skin
yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)
See your GP if you have any persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by hepatitis.
Long-term (chronic) hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly (liver failure) and may only be picked up during blood tests.
In the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion, and blood in your stools or vomit."
Hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person, and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor.
Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life threatening.
There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms like pain, nausea and itching.
Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if:
you're at high risk of infection or severe consequences of infection
you're travelling to an area where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and eastern Europe.

Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person.
It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact.
It can also be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs.
Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK. It most commonly affects people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months.
But most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B, and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medicine can be used to treat it.
In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as:
healthcare workers
people who inject drugs
men who have sex with men
children born to mothers with hepatitis B
people travelling to parts of the world where the infection is more common
Hepatitis B vaccination is also part of the routine immunisation programme so all children can benefit from protection from this virus.

Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus.
It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.
In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs.
Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it's spread outside the UK.
Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected.
Some people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In other cases, it'll stay in the body for many years.
This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure.
Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medicines, but there's currently no vaccine available.
Find out more about hepatitis C"
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body.
Hepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact. It's uncommon in the UK, but is more widespread in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America.
Long-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.
There's no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine can help protect you from it."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. The number of cases in Europe has increased in recent years and it's now the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK.
The virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal, but also with wild boar meat, venison and shellfish. 
Hepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that does not require any treatment, but it can be serious in some people, such as those who have a weakened immune system.
There's no vaccine for hepatitis E. When travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, where epidemic hepatitis E may be common, you can reduce your risk by practising good food and water hygiene measures.
The British Liver Trust has more information about hepatitis E"
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is a type of hepatitis caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years.
The condition is common in the UK and many people do not realise they have it.
This is because it does not usually cause any symptoms, although it can cause sudden jaundice and liver failure in some people.
Stopping drinking will usually allow your liver to recover, but there's a risk you could eventually develop cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer if you continue to drink alcohol excessively.
You can reduce your risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis by controlling how much you drink.
It's recommended that you do not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week.
Read more about alcohol-related liver disease and the health risks associated with alcohol."
Autoimmune hepatitis,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of long-term hepatitis where the immune system attacks and damages the liver.
Eventually, the liver can become so damaged that it stops working properly.
Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves very effective medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.
It's not clear what causes autoimmune hepatitis and it's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it.
The British Liver Trust has more information about autoimmune hepatitis"
How you can get hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that spreads in poo.
The infection is more common in parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Central and South America.
You can get hepatitis A from:
drinking unclean water
eating food that's been washed or grown in unclean water
eating food that's been handled by an infected person
close physical contact with an infected person, including having sex and sharing needles to take drugs"
How to prevent hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A vaccination
Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A.
Hepatitis A vaccines are not routinely offered in the UK because the risk of getting infected is low.
You only need to get a vaccine if you are at high risk of catching or getting seriously ill from hepatitis A. For example:
you are travelling to a country where hepatitis A is common – you may need to pay for a hepatitis A vaccine for travel
you have recently been in close physical contact with someone with hepatitis A
you have long-term liver disease
you have a blood clotting disorder, such some people with haemophilia
you are a man who has sex with men
your job puts you at risk of infection – for example, you’re a healthcare worker or a sewage worker
Speak to your GP if you think you need a hepatitis A vaccine. If your job puts you at risk, your employer should organise your vaccination.
Information:
If you are travelling abroad, get advice from a travel clinic, GP, nurse, or pharmacist before you go.
Other ways to reduce your risk
You can also help prevent hepatitis A when travelling by:
washing your hands thoroughly before preparing and eating food
drinking bottled water
avoiding eating shellfish and uncooked fruit and vegetables
using a condom or dam when having sex"
Check if you have hepatitis A,"Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include:
a high temperature
flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, headache, and muscle pains
feeling sick or being sick
pain in your upper tummy
diarrhoea or constipation
pale yellow or pale grey poo
dark brown pee
itchy skin – you may also have a raised rash (hives)
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
Most children, and some adults, may have mild symptoms or no symptoms."
Treatment for hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A usually clears up on its own within 3 to 6 months.
Your doctor may offer you medicines to help with the symptoms, such as painkillers or medicines to stop you feeling sick or itchy.
A small number of people with hepatitis A may get liver problems. You may need blood tests to check your liver is working properly."
Things you can do if you have hepatitis A,"There are some things you can do when you have hepatitis A to help ease the symptoms, and to stop infecting others.
Important:
How long you're infectious
You're usually infectious for either:
7 days after yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) started
7 days after your symptoms started, if you've not had jaundice
Do
limit contact with other people for 7 days after your symptoms started or 7 days after jaundice started (adults should stay off work and children should stay off from school or nursery)
rest and drink plenty of fluids
take painkillers like ibuprofen and paracetamol - ask your doctor for advice on how much paracetamol you should take because you may not be able to take a normal dose
keep your room well ventilated, wear loose-fitting clothing, and avoid hot baths and showers if you feel itchy
wash your hands thoroughly after going to the toilet
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not prepare food or drink for others
do not have sex without a condom or dam until you're no longer infectious
do not share needles with others"
How you can get hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is caused by a virus that is spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids.
You can get hepatitis B from:
having vaginal, anal or oral sex without using a condom or dam
injecting drugs using shared needles
being injured by a used needle
having a tattoo or piercing with unsterilised equipment
having a blood transfusion in a country that does not check blood for hepatitis B. Blood transfusions in the UK are checked for hepatitis B.
If you're pregnant and have hepatitis B, you can also pass it onto your baby during pregnancy or birth.
Higher risk areas
The risk of getting hepatitis B is higher in some parts of the world, including:
Africa
Asia
the Middle East
parts of South America and eastern Europe"
How to prevent hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B vaccination
Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis B. In the UK, the hepatitis B vaccine is given to babies as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine.
Babies born to mothers with hepatitis B are given additional vaccinations at birth, 4, weeks and 1 year, to reduce the risk of them getting the infection.
Adults only need to get the vaccine if they're at high risk, for example:
you are travelling to a high-risk country – you may have to pay for a hepatitis B vaccine for travel
you have liver or kidney disease
you have HIV
your job puts you at risk of infection – for example, you're a healthcare worker or work in a prison
Your employer should organise your vaccination if your job puts you at risk.
If you're travelling abroad, get advice from a travel clinic, GP, nurse or pharmacist before you go.
Other ways to reduce your risk
To help protect yourself from hepatitis B you should also:
use a condom or dam when having vaginal, anal, or oral sex
avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, and needles with others"
Check if you have hepatitis B,"Symptoms of hepatitis B infection include:
a high temperature
tiredness
pain in your upper tummy
feeling sick or being sick
patches of raised skin that may be itchy (hives)
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
The infection usually lasts for 1 to 3 months and most people either have no symptoms or mild symptoms. If the infection lasts longer than 6 months it is called chronic hepatitis B."
Treatments for hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B usually clears up on its own without treatment. You may be offered medicine to help with the symptoms, such as painkillers or medicines to stop you feeling sick.
Your GP will refer you to see a liver specialist who will check how well your liver is working.
If hepatitis B lasts for over 6 months it is called long-term (chronic) hepatitis B.
It is usually treated with antivirals and medicine to help relieve symptoms such as itchiness, pain, and sickness. You will also need to see a liver specialist for regular check-ups."
Living with hepatitis B,"As well as medical treatments, there are some things you can when you have hepatitis B to help ease the symptoms and stop the infection spreading to others.
Do
rest and stay hydrated
take painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen – ask your doctor for advice about how much paracetamol you should take as you may not be able to take a normal dose
keep your room well ventilated, wear loose clothing and avoid hot showers and baths if you feel itchy
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not have sex without a condom or dam
do not share razors, toothbrushes or needles with others"
Complications of hepatitis B,"Most people do not have any lasting problems after having a hepatitis B infection.
If left untreated, chronic hepatitis B can cause liver damage (cirrhosis) and increase your risk of getting liver cancer.
It is important to take any medicine you have been prescribed and go for regular check-ups to make sure your liver is working properly."
Symptoms of hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C often does not have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged.
This means many people have the infection without realising it.
When symptoms do occur, they can be mistaken for another condition.
Symptoms can include:
flu-like symptoms, such as muscle aches and a high temperature (fever)
feeling tired all the time
loss of appetite
stomach ache
feeling and being sick
The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested."
How do you get hepatitis C?,"The hepatitis C virus is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact.
Some ways the infection can be spread include:
sharing unsterilised needles – particularly needles used to inject recreational drugs
sharing razors or toothbrushes
from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby
through unprotected sex – although this is very rare
In the UK, most hepatitis C infections happen in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past.
It's estimated around half of those who inject drugs have been infected with the virus.
Blood donations before September 1991
Since September 1991, all blood donated in the UK is checked for the hepatitis C virus.
There's a small chance you may have been infected with hepatitis C if:
you received a blood transfusion or blood products before September 1991
you received an organ transplant before 1992
Before 1992 donated organs were not routinely screened for hepatitis C and there is a very small risk a donated organ from someone with hepatitis C could spread the infection.
There are blood tests to check for hepatitis C infection.
If you contracted hepatitis C via an NHS blood transfusion or blood products before September 1991, you may be able to get financial support.
There are 4 schemes. Select the scheme where the infection happened for more information:
England
Northern Ireland
Scotland
Wales"
Getting tested for hepatitis C,"Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C or there's a risk you're infected, even if you do not have any symptoms.
A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection.
You can do a finger-prick test at home to find out if you have hepatitis C.
GPs, sexual health clinics, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics or drug treatment services also offer testing for hepatitis C.
Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver, as well as help ensure the infection is not passed on to other people.
Find out how to get a free home test for hepatitis C
Find out more about testing for hepatitis C"
Treatments for hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C can be treated with medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several weeks.
Until recently, most people would have taken 2 main medicines called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet).
Tablet-only treatments are now available.
These new hepatitis C medicines have been found to make treatment more effective, are easier to tolerate, and have shorter treatment courses.
They include sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.
Using the latest medications, more than 90% of people with hepatitis C may be cured.
But it's important to be aware that you will not be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again."
Complications of hepatitis C,"If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). 
Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly.
In severe cases, life-threatening problems, such as liver failure, where the liver loses most or all of its functions, or liver cancer, can eventually develop.
Treating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems happening.
Find out more about the complications of hepatitis C"
Preventing hepatitis C,"There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected.
These include:
not sharing any drug-injecting equipment with other people – including needles and other equipment, such as syringes, spoons and filters
not sharing razors or toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood
The risk of getting hepatitis C through sex is very low. But it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex.
Condoms are not usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner."
Potential issues with herbal medicines,"If you're taking, or plan to take, any herbal medicines, be aware of the following:
They may cause problems if you're taking other medicines. They could make the other medicine less effective or cause the other medicine to trigger unexpected side effects.
You may experience a bad reaction or side effects after taking a herbal medicine.
Not all herbal medicines are regulated. Remedies specially prepared for individuals don't need a licence, and those manufactured outside the UK may not be subject to regulation.
Evidence for the effectiveness of herbal medicines is generally very limited. Although some people find them helpful, in many cases their use tends to be based on traditional use rather than scientific research.
Certain groups of people should be particularly wary of taking herbal medicines."
Who should avoid herbal medicines?,"Taking a herbal medicine may not be suitable for:
people taking other medicines, including hormonal contraceptives, such as the combined pill
people with serious health conditions, such as liver or kidney disease
people who are going to have surgery
pregnant or breastfeeding women
the elderly
children – as with all medicines, herbal medicines should be kept out of the sight and reach of children
Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice before trying a herbal medicine if you fall into one of these groups."
Herbal medicines and surgery,"It's important to tell your doctor if you take any herbal medicines before undergoing surgery.
This is because:
some herbal medicines might interfere with anaesthesia and other medicines used before, during or after procedures
some herbal medicines may interfere with blood clotting and blood pressure, which may increase the risk of bleeding during or after surgery
Your doctor may therefore advise you to stop taking any herbal medicines during the weeks leading up to your operation."
What to look for when buying a herbal medicine,"If you want to try a herbal medicine, look out for a traditional herbal registration (THR) marking on the product packaging.
This means the medicine complies with quality standards relating to safety and manufacturing, and it provides information about how and when to use it.
But you should be aware that:
THR products are intended for conditions that can be self-medicated and don't require medical supervision, such as coughs, colds or general aches and pains
using THR products for more serious conditions could be harmful, especially if you delay seeking medical advice
claims made for THR products are based on traditional usage and not on evidence of the product's effectiveness
a THR mark doesn't mean the product is completely safe for everyone to take
You can find THR-registered products in your local health shop, pharmacy or supermarket."
Risks of buying herbal medicines online or by mail order,"The risks of obtaining fake, substandard, unlicensed or contaminated medicines are increased by buying medicines online or by mail order.
Unlicensed herbal medicines manufactured outside the UK may not be subject to regulation.
They may be copies of licensed medicines, but made in unlicensed factories with no quality control.
Some websites may appear to be legitimate, but are fronted by people pretending to be doctors or pharmacists. 
Herbal products sold online may also contain banned ingredients and toxic substances.
You can find a list of banned and restricted herbal ingredients on the GOV.UK website.
Herbal slimming products and products that claim to improve sexual performance, for example, are best avoided.
This is because they have been found to contain dangerous ingredients, including pharmaceutical ingredients, that aren't stated on the label."
Reporting side effects,"You can report any side effect or adverse reaction to a herbal medicine using the Yellow Card Scheme run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
This can help the MHRA identify new side effects or risks associated with medicines, including herbal remedies.
You should report adverse reactions or side effects if:
you suspect the side effect or adverse reaction was caused by a conventional medicine or herbal medicine you were taking
the side effect occurs when you're taking more than one medicine or herbal medicine
It's important to include as much detail as possible, particularly any brand name or manufacturer's details relating to the herbal medicine.
In the past, Yellow Card reports have been used to identify interactions between St John's wort and other medicines, and to highlight the use of dangerous substances like mercury, lead and arsenic in unlicensed Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines."
Symptoms of HHT,"The typical symptoms of HHT include:
regular nosebleeds
visible red spots in certain places on the body
Symptoms usually start in childhood or in the teenage years, but can start at any age.
See a GP if you have these symptoms so they can investigate the cause.
Nosebleeds
Nosebleeds are often the first sign of HHT. They may be frequent and persistent.
They happen because of the abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the nose.
The loss of blood can lead to iron-deficiency anaemia, if the iron is not replaced through the diet and with iron supplements.
Red or purple spots under the skin (telangiectasia)
Abnormal blood vessels (telangiectasia) may appear just underneath the skin, which show as red or purple spots.
These often start to appear in adolescence.
Red or purple spots usually form on the fingertip pads, the lips, and the lining of the nose or the gut. Sometimes, they can form on the ears and face.
Abnormal blood vessels (AVMs) inside the body 
AVMs can form inside the body organs and tissues. Many people with AVMs inside the body will not have any symptoms.
However, AVMs in the lungs can lead to low blood oxygen levels and AVMs in the brain can cause seizures or headaches.
If AVMs in the body bleed, this can increase the risk of a stroke."
Causes of HHT,"People with HHT have a faulty gene, which is usually inherited from one of their parents.
This gene normally provides instructions for making certain proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels. In HHT, the gene cannot produce this protein, or the protein it produces is abnormal.
You only need to have 1 copy of the faulty gene to develop HHT."
Treatment for HHT,"There's no cure for HHT, but there are effective treatments.
Some people can be treated by a GP and others need to be under the care of a specialist.
There are increased risks during pregnancy for women with HHT, such as a slight increased risk of a major bleed or a stroke. Tell a midwife or GP if you have HHT in your family and you become pregnant.
Iron supplements
If you have regular nosebleeds you will probably lose a lot of iron through this loss of blood, especially if you also bleed from telangiectasia in the gut.
It may be necessary to replace the lost iron with iron supplements. Dietary changes alone may not be enough.
Read about:
the importance of iron
iron deficiency anaemia
Treatment of nosebleeds
People with severe nosebleeds may need emergency nasal packing, where the nose is packed with ribbon gauze or a special nasal sponge. 
Read about nosebleeds.
Some people may need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for treatment. Laser therapy may help.
More severe cases may be treated with skin grafting or other surgery.
Blood transfusion after loss of blood
If a lot of blood has been lost from bleeding inside the body or after nosebleeds, a blood transfusion may be needed.
Read about blood transfusions.
Laser treatment for telangiectasia
Telangiectasia on the skin or in the lining of the nose can sometimes be improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment:
for the skin, you'll usually need a referral to a dermatologist – this may be expensive if treatment is not available on the NHS as 2 to 4 treatments a year may be needed
for the nose, you'll need a referral to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist – these treatments are usually available on the NHS
Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers makes the veins shrink so they're no longer visible. This should leave minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area.
Laser treatment can be uncomfortable, but most people do not need a local anaesthetic."
Treating AVMs inside the body,"AVMs in the body may require specialist treatment. Your HHT specialist will explain any procedures to you in more detail.
For example, AVMs in the lung are usually treated, even if they're not causing any apparent problems. They're treated by embolisation, a procedure that blocks the blood supply to the AVM. A tiny plug is inserted inside the artery supplying the abnormal blood vessel.
Embolisation is preferred to open surgery and is normally carried out under sedation (which helps relax you during the procedure).
For brain AVMs, embolisation, surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivering radiation to the blood vessel) are possible treatment options. Liver AVMs may require different types of specialist treatments.
However, these treatments are not always appropriate. Your specialist will explain why many AVMs, such as those in the liver and in the brain, may be better left alone. The risks of treatments may outweigh the potential benefits."
Information about you,"If you have HHT, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of HNPP,"HNPP most commonly affects your legs, feet, elbows, wrists or hands.
Symptoms can include:
numbness, tingling, muscle weakness
pain in the limbs
loss of sensation in the hand (similar to carpal tunnel syndrome)
muscle weakness, making it difficult to lift the front part of the foot (foot drop) or the wrist (wrist drop)
Symptoms vary in severity, and an episode can last from several minutes to months.
HNPP is not life threatening and most people have mild symptoms. Many people fully recover after an episode and do not have further symptoms.
Sometimes the affected nerve only partially heals, causing long-term nerve symptoms and muscle problems. But even if this happens, symptoms are usually mild and unlikely to lead to a severe disability."
Getting medical advice,"See a GP if you have any symptoms of HNPP. The GP will ask about your symptoms, family history, and may carry out a physical examination.
If HNPP is suspected, you may be referred to a neurologist for further tests. You may also be offered a genetic test to confirm the diagnosis."
Treatment of HNPP,"There's no cure for HNPP, but there are things you can do to help manage your condition.
If you start to experience symptoms, try to avoid:
prolonged sitting with your legs crossed
leaning on your elbows, resting the backs of your arms on a chair, or having someone rest on your arm
repetitive movements of your wrists or elbows
It can also help to:
make a note of what triggers your symptoms so you can change the way you do certain activities
see an occupational therapist for advice on how to carry out day-to-day activities
lose weight if you're overweight
wear ankle or wrist supports, and protective elbow and knee pads, to prevent the nerves getting worse
add a foam mattress topper to your bed to lessen pressure on your affected nerves
If you're suffering from nerve pain, there are medicines you can take."
Causes of HNPP,"HNPP is 1 of many inherited conditions that damage the peripheral nerves, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
It's caused by mutations in the PMP22 gene, which affect the development of myelin, a substance that protects nerve cells.
As the myelin is weak, just the slightest pressure, stretch or repetitive movement on the nerve causes sections of the myelin to be lost, leading to muscle weakness (pressure palsies)."
Support for people living with HNNP,"If you have HNPP, support is available to help you have the best possible quality of life.
It might help to speak with others who have the same condition, or connect with a charity.

Symptoms of hereditary spastic paraplegia,"The severity and progression of symptoms will vary from person to person.
About 90% of people with hereditary spastic paraplegia have what's known as a ""pure form"" of the condition.
This means their symptoms are mainly confined to lower limb weakness and involuntary spasms and muscle stiffness (spasticity).
The remaining 10% have a complicated or complex form of the condition.
This means they have other symptoms in addition to the muscle weakness and spasticity.
They may have a wide range of symptoms.
Pure hereditary spastic paraplegia
The main symptoms of pure hereditary spastic paraplegia are:
a gradual weakness in the legs
increased muscle tone and stiffness (spasticity)
problems peeing – such as an urgent need to pee, even when the bladder is not full
a lack of sensation in the feet (sometimes)
People with the condition may develop leg stiffness and problems walking, such as stumbling and tripping, particularly on uneven ground.
These problems are caused by weak hip muscles and difficulty bending the foot upwards.
Some people may eventually need to use a walking aid or a wheelchair to help them get around.
Others may not need to use any type of mobility equipment.
Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia
In complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, additional symptoms may include:
nerve damage in the feet or other extremities (peripheral neuropathy)
epilepsy
problems with balance, co-ordination and speech (ataxia)
eye problems – such as damage to the retina (retinopathy) and damage to the optic nerve (optic neuropathy)
dementia
ichthyosis – a condition that causes widespread and persistent thick, dry ""fish-scale"" skin
learning and developmental problems
hearing loss
speech, breathing or swallowing problems"
What causes hereditary spastic paraplegia?,"Most people with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia will have inherited a faulty gene from 1 of their parents.
People with the complicated form of the condition will have usually inherited a faulty gene from both parents.
The gene abnormality causes the long nerves in the spine to deteriorate.
These nerves normally control muscle tone and movement in the lower body."
Diagnosing hereditary spastic paraplegia,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia is diagnosed after a thorough clinical examination and the identification of typical symptoms.
Other conditions that cause mobility problems and muscle stiffness and weakness, such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy, need to be ruled out first.
A number of specialised tests may be used during diagnosis, including MRI scans of the brain and spine and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. 
In some cases, genetic testing may also be needed."
Treating hereditary spastic paraplegia,"It's not possible to prevent, slow or reverse hereditary spastic paraplegia, but some of the symptoms can be managed so day-to-day activities become easier.
For example:
muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, tizandine and botulinum (Botox) injections, can be used to help relieve spasticity
regular physiotherapy is important for helping improve and maintain muscle strength and range of movement
occupational therapy can help the person carry out their daily activities more easily and regain as much independence as possible
braces, splints or shoe inserts can help hold the foot in position and improve walking
surgery may occasionally be needed to release tendons or shortened muscles"
Complications of hereditary spastic paraplegia,"Possible complications of hereditary spastic paraplegia include:
shortening and hardening of the calf muscles – regular physiotherapy may help prevent this
cold feet – this is fairly common and occurs as a result of the deterioration of the nerves in the spine 
extreme tiredness (fatigue) – this may be because of the extra effort needed for walking, and symptoms interrupting sleep
back and knee pain – caused by the muscle weakness and walking problems
stress and depression"
Outlook,"The outlook for people with hereditary spastic paraplegia varies.
Some people are severely affected and need a wheelchair, while others have mild symptoms and do not need to use a mobility aid.
Pure hereditary spastic paraplegia does not usually affect life expectancy, and most people are able to lead relatively independent and active lives.
The outlook for complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia varies between people, depending on the symptoms."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you or your child have hereditary spastic paraplegia, your clinical team may pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists identify more effective ways of treating or preventing rare conditions.
You can opt out of the register at any time."
Types of hernia,"Inguinal hernias
Inguinal hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.
This is the most common type of hernia and it mainly affects men. It's often associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.
Femoral hernias
Femoral hernias also happen when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.
They're much less common than inguinal hernias and tend to affect more women than men.
Like inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are also associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.
Umbilical hernias
Umbilical hernias occur when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through your tummy near your belly button.
This type of hernia can occur in babies if the opening in the tummy that the umbilical cord passes through does not seal properly after birth.
Adults can also be affected, possibly as a result of repeated strain on the tummy.
Hiatus hernias
Hiatus hernias occur when part of the stomach pushes up into your chest by squeezing through an opening in the diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the tummy.
This type of hernia may not have any noticeable symptoms, although it can cause heartburn in some people.
It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernias, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age or pressure on the tummy.
Other types of hernia
Other types of hernia that can affect the tummy include:
incisional hernias – where tissue pokes through a surgical wound in your tummy that has not fully healed
epigastric hernias – where fatty tissue pokes through your tummy, between your belly button and the lower part of your breastbone
spigelian hernias – where part of your bowel pokes through your tummy at the side of your abdominal muscle, usually below your belly button
diaphragmatic hernias – where organs in your tummy move into your chest through an opening in the diaphragm; this can also affect babies if their diaphragm does not develop properly in the womb
muscle hernias – where part of the muscle pokes through the tissue; they commonly occur in leg muscles as a result of a sports injury"
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP if you think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary.
You should go to your nearest A&E straight away if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms:
sudden, severe pain
being sick
difficulty pooing or passing wind
the hernia becomes firm or tender, or cannot be pushed back in
These symptoms could mean that either: 
the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation)
a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction)
A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible."
Assessing a hernia,"A GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area.
In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem.
This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body.
Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, a GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary.
A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including:
the type of hernia – some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated or cause a bowel obstruction than others
the content of your hernia – if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction
your symptoms and the impact on your daily life – surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities
your general health – surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor
Although most hernias will not get better without surgery, they will not necessarily get worse.
In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits."
Surgery for a hernia,"There are 2 main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out:
open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the tummy
laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) – this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia
Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks.
If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia coming back.
Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.

Check if you have a hiatus hernia,"You can have a hiatus hernia without knowing and without it being a problem.
With a hiatus hernia you may:
have a painful burning feeling in your chest, often after eating (heartburn)
bring up small amounts of food or bitter-tasting fluids (acid reflux)
have bad breath
burp and feel bloated
feel or be sick
have difficulty or pain when swallowing
These are the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)."
Treatment for a hiatus hernia,"Broadly, treatment follows these steps:
Change your eating habits, for example, eat smaller, more frequent meals and do other things to help with the symptoms of GORD.
If you smoke, try to give up, as it can irritate your digestive system and make your symptoms worse.
Buy medicines from the pharmacy (ask the pharmacist what you should take to help with the symptoms of GORD).
If medicines from the pharmacy and changing your eating habits do not help, see a GP, who can prescribe stronger medicines.
If stronger medicines do not work, a GP can send you for further tests to find out if your symptoms are caused by a hiatus hernia. They might also prescribe medicines for long-term GORD.
A GP might refer you to a specialist to check if you need surgery. This usually only happens if other treatments have not worked and you keep having very bad symptoms."
What causes a hiatus hernia,"It's not clear what causes a hiatus hernia. Anyone can have one, but it's more common if you're over 50, pregnant or overweight."
What is an inguinal hernia?,"An inguinal (pronounced ""ingwinal"") hernia is the most common type of hernia.
It can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum (the pouch containing the testicles). The swelling may be painful.
The lump often appears when you're lifting something and disappears when you lie down.
For information on other types of hernia, see:
femoral hernia
hiatus hernia
umbilical hernia"
What causes an inguinal hernia?,"An inguinal hernia usually happens when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.
It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into an area called the inguinal canal.
Inguinal hernias mainly affect men. Most are thought to be caused by ageing, although they can happen at any age.
This is because as you get older, the muscles surrounding your abdomen (tummy) can become weaker.
Inguinal hernias can sometimes appear suddenly after putting pressure on the abdomen, such as straining on the toilet if you have constipation or carrying and pushing heavy loads.
They have also been linked to having a persistent, heavy cough."
When is surgery needed?,"Inguinal hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall.
The operation is usually recommended if you have a hernia that causes pain, severe or persistent symptoms, or if any serious complications develop.
Complications that can happen as a result of an inguinal hernia include:
obstruction – where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the inguinal canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin
strangulation – where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply so it does not die
Surgery gets rid of the hernia to prevent any serious complications, but there's a chance it could return after the operation."
What happens during surgery?,"There are 2 ways an inguinal hernia repair can be performed:
open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen
laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery – a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use instruments to repair the hernia
There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you, and your surgeon's experience.
You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the instructions you're given while in hospital about how to look after yourself.
This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound, and avoiding strenuous activities.
Most people make a full recovery from inguinal hernia repair within 6 weeks, with many being able to return to work and light activities within 2 weeks.
Ask your surgeon or GP for advice on when it's safe for you to drive again. You should also speak to your insurer before driving again after having surgery.

Are there any risks from the operation?,"An inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. But a small number of hernias can come back at some point after surgery.
Other potential complications of an inguinal hernia repair include:
blood or fluid building up in the space left by the hernia (this usually gets better without treatment)
painful swelling and bruising of the testicles or the base of the penis
pain and numbness in the groin area caused by a nerve being damaged or trapped during surgery
damage to the blood supply to the testicles
damage to the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm to the testicles)
Complications are more likely if you're aged over 50, smoke or have another illness, such as heart disease or breathing problems."
Umbilical hernias,"Umbilical hernias are very common in infants and young children, particularly in babies born prematurely.
An umbilical hernia appears as a painless lump in or near the belly button (navel). 
It may get bigger when laughing, coughing, crying or going to the toilet and may shrink when relaxing or lying down.
Credit:
In many cases, the umbilical hernia goes back in and the muscles reseal by the time a child is 4 or 5 years old.
Umbilical hernias can also develop in adults. Without treatment, the hernia will probably get worse over time.
For information on other types of hernia, see:
inguinal hernia
femoral hernia
hiatus hernia"
What causes an umbilical hernia?,"During pregnancy, the umbilical cord passes through an opening in the baby's abdomen (tummy). This opening should close shortly after birth, but in some cases the muscles don't seal completely.
This leaves a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall). An umbilical hernia can develop when fatty tissue or a part of the bowel pokes through into an area near the navel.
In adults, factors that can contribute to developing an umbilical hernia include:
being overweight or obese
straining while you are lifting or moving heavy objects
having a persistent heavy cough
having a multiple pregnancy such as twins or triplets"
When surgery is needed,"If necessary, umbilical hernias can be treated with surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall.
This operation may be recommended for your child if the hernia is large or hasn't disappeared by the time they reach 4 or 5 years old.
You'll usually be advised to wait for your child to reach this age because the operation isn't essential unless there are complications. The risk of your child developing complications is very low.
Surgery is recommended for most adults with an umbilical hernia because the hernia is unlikely to get better by itself when you're older and the risk of complications is higher.
Complications that can develop as a result of an umbilical hernia include:
obstruction – where a section of the bowel becomes stuck outside the abdomen, causing nausea, vomiting and pain
strangulation – where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply so it doesn't die
Surgery will get rid of the hernia and prevent any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation."
Repairing an umbilical hernia,"An umbilical hernia repair is a relatively simple procedure that normally takes about 20 to 30 minutes. General anaesthetic is usually used so there's no pain while the operation is carried out.
In children, the weak spot in the abdominal wall is usually closed with stitches. If the hernia is large or in adults, a special mesh may be used to strengthen the area instead.
You or your child should be able to go home on the same day as the operation. You may feel a bit sore and uncomfortable while you recover. 
Yo may need to limit strenuous activities for a few weeks after the operation, and taking some time off school or work is often recommended. Most people are able to return to all their normal activities within 2 weeks of surgery.

Complications of umbilical hernia surgery,"Complications from an umbilical hernia repair are uncommon, but can include:
infection of the wound – it may appear red, have a yellow discharge and be painful or swollen
bleeding
rupture of the wound
the hernia returning"
How does a newborn baby catch herpes?,"During pregnancy and labour
If you had genital herpes for the first time within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy, your newborn baby is at risk of catching herpes.
There's a risk you will have passed the infection on to your baby if you had a vaginal delivery.
This risk is much lower if you have had genital herpes before.
After birth
The herpes simplex virus can be passed to a baby through a cold sore if a person has a cold sore and kisses the baby.
The herpes virus can also be spread to your baby if you have a blister caused by herpes on your breast and you feed your baby with the affected breast or expressed breast milk from the affected breast.
A baby is most at risk of getting a herpes infection in the first 4 weeks after birth.
You should not kiss a baby if you have a cold sore to reduce the risk of spreading infection.
Cold sores and other blisters caused by the herpes virus are at their most contagious when they burst. They remain contagious until completely healed."
What are the warning signs in babies?,"Because newborn babies have underdeveloped immune systems, they can quickly become seriously ill after catching the virus.
Call a GP or contact 111 straight away if your baby:
is lethargic or irritable
is not feeding
has a high temperature (fever) – find out how to take your baby's temperature
has a rash or sores on the skin, eyes and inside the mouth
These are early warning signs that your baby may be unwell.
Call 999 immediately if your baby:
is lacking in energy (listless)
is becoming floppy and unresponsive
is difficult to wake up from sleep
has breathing difficulties or starts grunting
breathes rapidly
has a blue tongue and skin (cyanosis) – if they have brown or black skin this may be easier to see on their lips, tongue and gums, under their nails and around their eyes
Very often the baby will not have any specific herpes symptoms, such as a rash.
But they can become unwell very quickly, so you need to act fast."
How is neonatal herpes treated?,"Neonatal herpes is usually treated with antiviral medicines given directly into the baby's vein (intravenously). 
This treatment may be needed for several weeks.
Any related complications, such as fits (seizures), will also need to be treated.
You can breastfeed your baby while they're receiving treatment, unless you have herpes sores around your nipples.
If you are taking antiviral treatment too, this can be excreted in your breast milk, but is not thought to cause any harm to your baby."
How serious is herpes for a baby?,"Sometimes neonatal herpes will only affect the baby's eyes, mouth or skin.
In these cases, most babies will make a complete recovery with antiviral treatment.
But the condition is much more serious if it has spread to the baby's organs.
Many infants with this type of neonatal herpes will die, even after they have been treated. 
If widespread herpes is not treated immediately, there's a high chance the baby will die."
How can neonatal herpes be prevented?,"If you're pregnant and have a history of genital herpes, tell your doctor or midwife. 
You may need to take medicine during the last month of pregnancy to prevent an outbreak of vaginal sores during labour.
Delivery by caesarean section is recommended if the genital herpes has occurred for the first time in the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy.
If you develop a cold sore or have any signs of a herpes infection, take these precautions:
do not kiss any babies
wash your hands before contact with a baby
wash your hands before breastfeeding
cover up any cold sores, lesions or signs of a herpes infection anywhere on your body to avoid passing on the virus"

Check if you have herpetic whitlow,"Herpetic whitlow can appear anywhere on your finger or thumb, but it usually affects the top of your finger (fingertip).
Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include:
swelling and pain in your finger
blisters or sores on your finger
skin becoming red or darker than your usual skin tone
feeling generally unwell and having a high temperature

Treatment from a GP,"You may be prescribed antiviral tablets if you see a GP within 48 hours of your symptoms showing.
Antiviral tablets can help your finger to heal more quickly.
If you cannot see a GP within 48 hours, the infection will usually go away without treatment within 2 to 3 weeks."
Things you can do if you have herpetic whitlow,"You can ease the symptoms of herpetic whitlow yourself by taking painkillers and avoiding touching the infected finger.
Do
keep the affected finger clean and covered with a dressing
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to ease the pain
try to discourage children with a whitlow from sucking their thumb
Don’t
do not touch the infected finger
do not touch other people with your infected finger to avoid spreading the infection
do not try to drain the fluid by squeezing the affected area
do not touch other areas of your body with the infected finger, particularly your eyes – if you wear contact lenses, use the hand that's not affected to put them in and take them out, or wear glasses until the infection has healed"
Causes of herpetic whitlow,"Herpetic whitlow is caused by a virus called herpes simplex. You can get it if you touch a cold sore or blister of another infected person.
You're more likely to get herpetic whitlow if you've had cold sores or genital herpes.
You may also get it if you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you have diabetes or you're having chemotherapy.
The first time you have herpetic whitlow will usually be the most severe."
Herpetic whitlow can come back,"Once you have the herpes virus, it stays in your body for the rest of your life, so if you get herpetic whitlow once you can get it again.
For example, it might come back if you have a cut or sore on your finger, or if you're feeling stressed or unwell.
There's not much you can do to prevent herpetic whitlow but it can be treated in the same way if it comes back."
Things you can do yourself to stop or prevent hiccups,"Although many people find these things helpful for stopping hiccups, there's no evidence that they work for everyone.
Do
breathe into a paper bag (do not put it over your head)
pull your knees up to your chest and lean forward
sip ice-cold water
swallow some granulated sugar
bite on a lemon or taste vinegar
hold your breath for a short time
Don’t
do not drink alcoholic, fizzy or hot drinks
do not chew gum or smoke – these can cause you to swallow air
do not eat spicy food
do not eat food very quickly
do not eat or drink something very cold immediately after something hot"
Why we get hiccups,"There's often no obvious reason why you get hiccups, but some people find certain things trigger their hiccups, such as:
stress
strong emotions, like excitement
eating and drinking
In rare cases, hiccups that last longer than 48 hours can be due to a medical condition or a medicine you're taking."
Treatment for hiccups from a GP,"A GP will want to find out if your hiccups are caused by a health condition or medicine you're taking.
Treating the condition or changing your medicine should stop your hiccups.
If there's no obvious cause, they might be able to prescribe a medicine called chlorpromazine to treat your hiccups. This does not work for everyone."
Symptoms,"The symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa range from mild to severe.
It causes a mixture of boil-like lumps, blackheads, cysts, scarring and channels in the skin that leak pus.
Hidradenitis suppurativa can cause fleshy lumps to grow on the surface of the skin
Credit:
Sometimes, narrow channels (sinus tracts) form under the skin, which can break out on the surface and leak pus
Credit:
The condition tends to start with blackheads, spots filled with pus and firm pea-sized lumps that develop in one place. The lumps will either disappear or rupture and leak pus after a few hours or days.
New lumps will then often develop in an area nearby. If these are not controlled with medicine, larger lumps may develop and spread. Narrow channels called sinus tracts also form under the skin that break out on the surface and leak pus.
Hidradenitis suppurativa can be very painful. The lumps develop on the skin in the following areas:
around the groin and genitals
in the armpits
on the bottom and around the anus
below the breasts
The lumps may also appear on the nape of the neck, waistband and inner thighs.
Some of the lumps may become infected with bacteria, causing a secondary infection that will need to be treated with antibiotics.
Many people with hidradenitis suppurativa also develop a pilonidal sinus, which is a small hole or ""tunnel"" in the skin at the top of the buttocks, where they divide (the cleft)."
What causes hidradenitis suppurativa?,"The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unknown, but the lumps develop as a result of blocked hair follicles.
Smoking and obesity are both strongly associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, and if you're obese and/or smoke it will make your symptoms worse.
Hidradenitis suppurativa usually starts around puberty, but it can occur at any age after puberty. This may suggest that sex hormones play a part. Many people with the condition also have acne and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).
In rare cases, hidradenitis suppurativa may be linked to Crohn's disease, particularly if it develops around the groin area and the skin near the anus. Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed.
Hidradenitis suppurativa runs in families in about 1 in 3 cases. It's not infectious and isn't linked to poor hygiene."
Diagnosing hidradenitis suppurativa,"There's no definitive test to help diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa.
A GP will examine the affected areas of skin, and they may take a swab of an infected area. This can be helpful in making a diagnosis because the condition is not usually associated with the presence of bacteria that cause skin infections.
Hidradenitis suppurativa could be mistaken for acne or ingrown hairs."
Treating hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa is a lifelong, recurring condition that is often difficult to manage, although the symptoms may improve or eventually stop with treatment.
It's important to recognise and diagnose the condition in its early stages to prevent it getting worse.
In the early stages, it may be controlled with medicine. Surgery may be required in severe or persistent cases.
Antibiotics
If you have lumps that are particularly painful, inflamed and oozing pus, you may be prescribed a 1- or 2-week course of antibiotics, if test show that you have a bacterial infection.
If bacterial infection is not present, low doses of antibiotics may be used to prevent inflammation. This longer course of antibiotics will last at least 3 months, to reduce the number of lumps that develop.
You may be given antibiotics as a cream (topical) or as a tablet, capsule or liquid. Antibiotic types can include lymecycline, doxycycline, erythromycin or clarithromycin.
In severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, a combination of clindamycin and rifampicin can be effective.
Antiseptics
Antiseptic washes, such as 4% chlorhexidine, applied daily to affected areas are often prescribed alongside other treatments.
Retinoids
Retinoids, such as acitretin, are vitamin-A based medicines that help some people with hidradenitis suppurativa.
Retinoids are always prescribed by dermatologists. They must be used with caution and cannot be taken during pregnancy. It's also important to avoid getting pregnant for 3 years after stopping treatment, so they're not usually prescribed if there's a chance you could get pregnant.
Contraceptives
If hidradenitis suppurativa flares up before a period you may benefit from taking oral contraceptives.
Immunosuppressive treatments (infliximab and adalimumab)
In severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, treatments that suppress the immune system, such as adalimumab or infliximab, can be useful.
However, there are risks associated with suppressing the immune system, so they are usually only prescribed by a dermatologist if other treatments do not work.
Infliximab and adalimumab are immunosuppressive treatments that are given by injection at regular intervals either at home or in hospital.
Steroids
Rarely, you may be prescribed steroids, such as prednisolone, to reduce severely inflamed skin. Steroids can be taken as skin creams or tablets, or you may have an injection directly into affected skin.
Possible side effects of steroids include weight gain, poor sleep and mood swings.
Read more about steroid creams (topical corticosteroids), steroid tablets and steroid injections.
Surgery
Surgery may be considered in cases where hidradenitis suppurativa cannot be controlled with medicine."
Lifestyle advice,"If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you should:
lose weight if you are overweight
stop smoking if you smoke
use an antiseptic skin wash or antiseptic soap – this may be prescribed alongside other treatment
hold a warm flannel on the lumps to encourage the pus to drain
wear loose-fitting clothes
avoid shaving affected skin"
Outlook,"Although hidradenitis suppurativa can persist for many years, if it's diagnosed early the symptoms can be improved with treatment.
However, the condition can have a significant impact on a person's everyday life. Having to regularly change dressings and constantly live with the pain and discomfort of the symptoms can affect your quality of life and lead to depression.
Speak to a GP if you're finding it difficult to cope."
High blood sugar levels,"If you have diabetes, you can find out if your blood sugar level is high by having a blood sugar (blood glucose) test.
You may have regular tests by your care team or GP surgery, or you may have tests you can do at home.
Types of diabetes test and high blood sugar levels.
Type of test High level
Test done by a health professional to check your blood sugar level over the last 2 or 3 months (HbA1c test) 48 mmol/mol or over (6.5% if you're given a percentage)
Test done by a health professional after not eating for a few hours (fasting glucose test) Over 7 mmol/L
Home test done after waking up or before eating Over 7 mmol/L
Home test done at any other time Over 11 mmol/L
Important
These blood sugar levels are a guide. Your levels may be different depending on your age and the type of diabetes you have. Check with your doctor or care team."
Symptoms of high blood sugar,"Symptoms of high blood sugar usually come on gradually and may only start when your blood sugar level gets very high.
Common symptoms include:
feeling very thirsty
peeing a lot
feeling weak or tired
blurred vision
losing weight"
Causes of high blood sugar,"Common causes of high blood sugar in people with diabetes include:
being unwell
feeling stressed
eating too much sugary or starchy food
being less active than usual
missing doses of diabetes medicine
You can also get high blood sugar if your diabetes medicine is not working well, you're taking certain medicines (such as steroids) or you recently had an operation."
How to lower your blood sugar,"If you have diabetes, it's important to try to stop your blood sugar level getting too high.
Do
take any diabetes medicine you've been prescribed, as advised by your doctor or care team
avoid eating too much sugary or starchy food
try to find ways to manage stress
exercise regularly
lose weight if you're overweight
follow advice from your doctor or care team about what to do while you're ill (sometimes called ""sick day rules"")
Don’t
do not skip or change doses of your diabetes medicine unless advised by your doctor or care team"
Problems caused by high blood sugar,"It's not usually a serious problem if your blood sugar is sometimes slightly high for a short time.
But high blood sugar can cause serious problems if it stays high for a long time or gets to a very high level.
It can lead to:
permanent damage to the nerves in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)
permanent damage to your eyes and problems with your sight (diabetic retinopathy)
life-threatening conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis
If you have high blood sugar, your doctor or care team may ask you to test your blood or pee to check for ketones. A high level of ketones is a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis."
Causes of hip pain,"There are lots of possible causes of hip pain. It might be caused by a sudden injury or a longer-lasting problem such as arthritis.
Your symptoms might give you an idea what could be causing the pain. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP if you're worried.
Common causes of hip pain and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain, swelling or bruising after intense or repetitive exercise Sprain or strain
Over 45 years of age, pain worse when walking and stiffness after moving Osteoarthritis
Pain and stiffness worse after not moving (for example, when you wake up) Rheumatoid arthritis
Hot, swollen hip and a high temperature or feeling hot and shivery Joint infection (septic arthritis)
Severe pain and unable to walk after a fall or injury Hip fracture"
How you can ease hip pain,"There are things you can do to help ease hip pain.
Do
try to avoid putting too much strain on your hip – it's best to keep moving if you can, but try not to overdo things
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
wear comfortable, shock-absorbing shoes with a soft sole
try to lose weight if you're overweight
try gentle hip stretching exercises
Don’t
do not carry anything heavy
do not sit in low chairs – this can put extra pressure on your hips"
Treatments for hip pain,"Treatment for hip pain depends on what's causing it.
A GP might:
prescribe stronger painkillers
give you some simple exercises to try
refer you for physiotherapy for more help with exercises and stretches to ease the pain
refer you for occupational therapy – an occupational therapist can help with things to make your life easier, such as walking sticks or walking aids
refer you to a specialist – the specialist may do a scan and discuss treatments such as steroid injections or surgery
Some people with pain caused by a damaged hip joint may eventually need a hip replacement if other treatments do not help.
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have hip pain, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for hip pain near you"
Causes of hip pain in children,"A condition called irritable hip is the most common cause of hip pain in children. This is where the hip joint becomes sore and inflamed.
Irritable hip can be painful, but it's not usually serious and often gets better by itself.
Other possible causes of hip pain in children include:
an infected hip joint (septic arthritis)
an injury like a broken bone
a problem with the hip bones and blood supply to the hip joint (Perthes' disease)
These other causes are less common but more serious."
What happens at your appointment,"To find out what's causing your child's pain, a doctor or nurse may:
look at and feel your child's hip, leg or knee
try gently moving the leg in different directions
ask about any recent injuries or illnesses
arrange an X-ray
Sometimes a blood test or other scans may also be done to confirm it's nothing serious."
Treatment for irritable hip,"Irritable hip usually gets better in 1 or 2 weeks and does not cause lasting problems.
If your child has irritable hip, you can usually look after them at home. Sometimes they may need to stay in hospital for a few days if they're in a lot of pain.
Do
make sure they rest their leg until they're feeling better – keep them off nursery or school until they're recovered
give them children's ibuprofen or children's paracetamol for their pain
attend any follow-up appointments recommended by your doctor or nurse
Don’t
do not let them do any activities that could put a lot of strain on their hip for at least 2 weeks – they can gradually return to their normal activities once they're feeling better (swimming is a good way to get the joint moving again)
Urgent advice:
Take your child back to the GP or hospital if:
their pain is getting worse or has not improved
they get a high temperature or feel hot and shivery
they're still in pain after 2 weeks
their pain went away but has come back
This might mean they have a more serious problem."
When a hip replacement is needed,"Hip replacement surgery is usually necessary when the hip joint is worn or damaged so that your mobility is reduced and you are in pain even while resting.
The most common reason for hip replacement surgery is osteoarthritis. Other conditions that can cause hip joint damage include:
rheumatoid arthritis
hip fracture
septic arthritis
disorders that cause unusual bone growth (bone dysplasias)"
Who is offered hip replacement surgery,"A hip replacement is major surgery, so it is usually only recommended if other treatments, such as physiotherapy or steroid injections, have not helped reduce pain or improve mobility.
You may be offered hip replacement surgery if:
you have severe pain, swelling and stiffness in your hip joint and your mobility is reduced
your hip pain is so severe that it interferes with your quality of life and sleep
everyday tasks, such as shopping or getting out of the bath, are difficult or impossible
you're feeling depressed because of the pain and lack of mobility
you cannot work or have a social life
You'll also need to be well enough to cope with both a major operation and the rehabilitation afterwards."
How hip replacement surgery is performed,"A hip replacement can be done under a general anaesthetic (where you're asleep during the operation) or under a spinal anaesthetic (where you're awake but have no feeling from the waist down).
Sometimes you may have an epidural, which is similar to a spinal anaesthetic.
The surgeon makes a cut (incision) into the hip, removes the damaged hip joint and replaces it with an artificial joint or implant.
The surgery usually takes around 1 to 2 hours to complete.
Find out more about how a hip replacement is done.
Hip resurfacing
Hip resurfacing is an alternative type of operation. This involves removing the damaged surfaces of the bones inside the hip joint and replacing them with a metal surface.
This type of operation removes less bone. However, it is usually only done on men who are very active and have larger hips.
Resurfacing is much less popular now due to concerns about the metal surface causing damage to soft tissues around the hip."
Preparing for hip replacement surgery,"Before you go into hospital, find out as much as you can about what's involved in your operation. Your hospital should provide written information or videos.
Stay as active as you can. Strengthening the muscles around your hip will help your recovery. If you can, continue to do gentle exercise, such as walking and swimming, in the weeks and months before your operation.
You may be referred to a physiotherapist, who will give you helpful exercises.
Your hospital may offer an enhanced recovery programme. This rehabilitation programme aims to get you back to full health quickly after major surgery.
Find out more about preparing for surgery, including information on travel arrangements, what to bring with you and attending a pre-operative assessment."
Recovering from hip replacement surgery,"You'll usually be in hospital for 3 to 5 days, but recovery time can vary.
Once you're ready to be discharged, your hospital will give you advice about looking after your hip at home. You'll need to use a frame or crutches at first and a physiotherapist will teach you exercises to help strengthen your hip muscles.
An occupational therapist will check if you need any equipment to help you manage at home.
You may also be enrolled in an exercise programme that's designed to help you regain and then improve the use of your hip joint.
It's usually possible to return to light activities or office-based work within around 6 weeks. However, everyone recovers differently and it's best to speak to your doctor or physiotherapist about when to return to normal activities.
Find out more about recovering from hip replacement surgery."
Risks of hip replacement surgery,"Complications of a hip replacement can include:
hip dislocation
infection at the site of the surgery
injuries to the blood vessels or nerves
DVT (deep vein thrombosis)
a fracture in the bone around the hip replacement during or after the operation
differences in leg length
However, the risk of serious complications is low.
There's also the risk that an artificial hip joint can wear out earlier than expected or go wrong in some way. Some people may require revision surgery to repair or replace the joint.
Find out more about the risks of a hip replacement.
Metal-on-metal implants
There have been cases of some metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements wearing out sooner than expected, causing deterioration in the bone and tissue around the hip. There are also concerns that they could leak traces of metal into the blood.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued updated guidelines that certain types of MoM devices should be checked every year while the implant is in place. This is so any potential complications can be found early.
MoM hip replacements are rarely used now. But if you're concerned about your hip replacement, contact your orthopaedic surgeon. They can give you a record of the type of hip replacement you have and tell you if any follow-up is required.
Get more advice about a metal-on-metal implant."
The National Joint Registry,"The National Joint Registry (NJR) collects details of hip replacements done in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Although it's voluntary, it's worth registering. This enables the NJR to monitor hip replacements, so you can be identified if any problems emerge in the future.
The registry also gives you the chance to participate in a patient feedback survey.
It's confidential and you have a right under the Data Protection Act to see what details are kept about you."
Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease,"Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease are usually noticeable soon after a baby is born, although sometimes they're not obvious until a child is older.
Signs of the condition in a baby include:
failing to pass meconium within 48 hours – the dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born (although some babies later diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease do pass meconium)
a swollen belly
vomiting green or yellow-green fluid (bile)
Signs in older infants and children include:
a swollen belly
vomiting or a stomach ache
persistent constipation that does not get better with the usual treatments
not feeding well or not gaining much weight"
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if your baby or child has symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease.
Hirschsprung's disease can be serious if left untreated, so it's important to get help as soon as possible.
If your GP suspects the condition, they'll refer you to hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis.
Call 999 or go to your nearest A&E if your child has symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease, as well as:
a high temperature of 38C or more
watery, foul-smelling or bloody diarrhoea
These could be the signs of a bowel infection (enterocolitis), which can be serious and lead to sepsis."
How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed,"Your child's tummy will usually be examined and sometimes a rectal examination may be carried out. 
This is where a doctor or nurse inserts a finger into the back passage (rectum) to feel for abnormalities.
If Hirschsprung's disease is suspected, an X-ray can be done to show a blockage and bulge in the bowel.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a rectal biopsy, which involves inserting a small instrument into your child's bottom to remove a tiny sample of the affected bowel.
This is then examined under the microscope to see if the nerve cells are missing."
What causes Hirschsprung's disease?,"The muscles of the bowel are controlled by nerve cells called ganglion cells.
In Hirschsprung's disease, ganglion cells are missing from a section at the end of bowel, extending up from the anus (the opening in the bottom that poo passes through).
For some reason, the cells did not develop in that area when the baby was growing in the womb.
It's not clear why this happens, but it's not thought to be caused by anything the mother did while she was pregnant.
A number of genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease and it does sometimes run in families.
If you have had a child with it before, you're more likely to have another child with it.
The condition is occasionally part of a wider genetic condition, such as Down's syndrome, but most cases are not."
Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease,"All children with Hirschsprung's disease will need surgery.
As they wait for surgery, they may need to:
stop having milk feeds and instead be given fluids directly into a vein
have a tube passed through their nose and into their stomach to drain away any fluid and air collecting in it
have regular bowel washouts, where a thin tube is inserted into their bottom and warm salt water is used to soften and flush out the trapped stools
take antibiotics if they have enterocolitis
Your child may need to stay in hospital during this time, or you may be able to look after them at home. Your doctor will advise you about this.
Surgery
Most children will have the ""pull-through"" operation, where the affected section of bowel is removed and the remaining healthy sections of bowel are joined together.
If your child is not well enough to have this procedure (for example, because they have enterocolitis or a severe blockage), or if they're older than a newborn, they may have it in 2 stages.
In the 1st stage, the surgeon will divert the bowel through a temporary opening (stoma) made in the tummy. This procedure is called a colostomy formation.
Stools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough for the 2nd stage to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening and join the healthy sections of bowel together.
These procedures can be done using either:
laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery – this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts
open surgery – where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy
Speak to your surgeon about the best option for your child.
Risks of surgery
No surgery is risk-free. There's a small chance of:
bleeding during or after the operation
the bowel becoming infected (enterocolitis)
bowel contents leaking into the body, which could lead to serious infection (peritonitis) if not treated quickly
the bowel becoming narrowed or blocked again, requiring further surgery
Recovery from surgery
Your child will probably need to stay in hospital for a few days after surgery.
They'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food and drink.
No special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover. 
Your child should recover well and their bowels should function normally if they've had a pull-through operation or both stages of the 2 stage operation.
At first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo. It can help to:
leave their bottom open to the air whenever possible
use baby oil to gently clean their bottom
use nappy cream after each change
Call 999 or go to your nearest A&E if your child develops problems such as a swollen belly, new tummy pain, a fever or foul-smelling diarrhoea."
Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease,"Most children are able to pass stools normally and have a normal functioning bowel after surgery, although they may take a bit longer to toilet train.
Some may experience persistent constipation and need to follow a high-fibre diet and take laxatives. Your doctor will advise about this treatment.
Some children have problems controlling their bowels (bowel incontinence), which can last until they're a teenager and be very distressing. 
Speak to your GP if this is a problem. You can also read advice about soiling in children.
There is a small possibility that your child may need a permanent stoma."
Information about your child,"If your child has been affected by Hirschsprung's disease, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS register on the GOV.UK website"
Symptoms of HIV infection,"Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV"
Causes of HIV infection,"HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex."
Diagnosing HIV,"Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options."
Treatment for HIV,"Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test."
Living with HIV,"If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.

If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby."
Preventing HIV,"Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U)."
Check if it's hives,"The main symptom of hives is an itchy rash.
The rash can:
be raised bumps or patches in many shapes and sizes
appear anywhere on the body
be on 1 area or spread across the body
feel itchy, sting or burn
look pink or red when affecting someone with white skin; the colour of the rash can be harder to see on brown and black skin

A pharmacist can help with hives,"A pharmacist can give you advice about antihistamine treatment to help a hives rash.
Tell the pharmacist if you have a long-term condition, because you might not be able to take antihistamines.
This treatment might not be suitable for young children.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for hives from a GP,"A GP might prescribe menthol cream, antihistamines or steroid tablets.
If hives does not go away with treatment, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist)."
You cannot always prevent hives,"You get hives when something causes high levels of histamine and other chemicals to be released in your skin. This is known as a trigger.
Triggers can include:
eating certain foods
contact with certain plants, animals, chemicals and latex
cold, such as cold water or wind
hot, sweaty skin from exercise, emotional stress or eating spicy food
a reaction to a medicine, insect bite or sting
scratching or pressing on your skin, such as wearing itchy or tight clothing
an infection
a problem with your immune system
water or sunlight, but this is rare
Try to find out what triggers hives for you, so you can avoid those triggers, if possible. This may help prevent an episode of hives."
Why someone may hoard,"The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood.
It can be a symptom of another condition. For example, someone with mobility problems may be physically unable to clear the huge amounts of clutter they have acquired, and people with learning disabilities or people developing dementia may be unable to categorise and dispose of items.
Mental health problems associated with hoarding include:
severe depression
psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to:
live alone
be unmarried
have had a deprived childhood, with either a lack of material objects or a poor relationship with other members of their family
have a family history of hoarding
have grown up in a cluttered home and never learned to prioritise and sort items
Many people who hoard have strongly held beliefs related to acquiring and discarding things, such as: ""I may need this someday"" or ""If I buy this, it will make me happy"". Others may be struggling to cope with a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one.
Attempts to discard things often bring up very strong emotions that can feel overwhelming, so the person hoarding often tends to put off or avoid making decisions about what can be thrown out.
Often, many of the things kept are of little or no monetary value and may be what most people would consider rubbish.
The person may keep the items for reasons that are not obvious to other people, such as for sentimental reasons, or feeling the objects appear beautiful or useful. Most people with a hoarding disorder have a very strong emotional attachment to the objects."
What's the difference between hoarding and collecting?,"Many people collect items such as books or stamps, and this is not considered a problem. The difference between a ""hoard"" and a ""collection"" is how these items are organised.
A collection is usually well ordered, and the items are easily accessible. A hoard is usually very disorganised, takes up a lot of room and the items are largely inaccessible.
For example, someone who collects newspaper reviews may cut out the reviews they want and organise them in a catalogue or scrapbook. Someone who hoards may keep large stacks of newspapers that clutter their entire house and mean it's not actually possible to read any of the reviews they wanted to keep."
Signs of a hoarding disorder,"Someone who has a hoarding disorder may typically:
keep or collect items that may have little or no monetary value, such as junk mail and carrier bags, or items they intend to reuse or repair
find it hard to categorise or organise items
have difficulty making decisions
struggle to manage everyday tasks, such as cooking, cleaning and paying bills
become extremely attached to items, refusing to let anyone touch or borrow them
have poor relationships with family or friends
Hoarding can start as early as the teenage years and gets more noticeable with age. For many, hoarding becomes more problematic in older age, but the problem is usually well established by this time."
Items people may hoard,"Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects.
Items that are often hoarded include:
newspapers and magazines
books
clothes
leaflets and letters, including junk mail
bills and receipts
containers, including plastic bags and cardboard boxes
household supplies
Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly.
More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that they're extremely reluctant to delete."
Why hoarding disorders are a problem,"A hoarding disorder can be a problem for several reasons. It can take over the person's life, making it very difficult for them to get around their house. It can cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer.
The person hoarding is usually reluctant or unable to have visitors or even allow tradesmen in to carry out essential repairs, which can cause isolation and loneliness.
The clutter can pose a health risk to the person and anyone who lives in or visits their house. For example, it can:
make cleaning very difficult, leading to unhygienic conditions and encouraging rodent or insect infestations
be a fire risk and block exits in the event of a fire
cause trips and falls
fall over or collapse on people, if kept in large piles
The hoarding could also be a sign of an underlying condition, such as OCD, other types of anxiety, depression and dementia."
What you can do if you suspect someone is hoarding,"If you think a family member or someone you know has a hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to come with you to see a GP.
This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing.
Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. You're just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering.
Your GP may be able to refer you to your local community mental health team, which might have a therapist who's familiar with issues such as OCD and hoarding.
If you have difficulties accessing therapy, the charity OCD-UK may be able to help.
It's generally not a good idea to get extra storage space or call in the council or environmental health to clear the rubbish away. This won't solve the problem and the clutter often quickly builds up again."
How hoarding disorders are treated,"It's not easy to treat a hoarding disorder, even when the person is prepared to seek help, but it can be overcome.
The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The therapist will help the person to understand what makes it difficult to throw things away and the reasons why the clutter has built up.
This will be combined with practical tasks and a plan to work on. It's important the person takes responsibility for clearing the clutter from their home. The therapist will support and encourage this.
Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders.
If a person is willing to get help then they may feel more comfortable contacting a therapist themselves. They can refer themselves directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
Find an NHS talking therapies service
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think (cognitive) and act (behaviour).
It encourages you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings.
Regular sessions of CBT over a long period of time are usually necessary and will almost always need to include some home-based sessions, working directly on the clutter.
This requires motivation, commitment and patience, as it can take many months to achieve the treatment goal.
The goal is to improve the person's decision-making and organisational skills, help them overcome urges to save and, ultimately, clear the clutter, room by room. 
The therapist won't throw anything away but will help guide and encourage the person to do so. The therapist can also help the person develop decision-making strategies, while identifying and challenging underlying beliefs that contribute to the hoarding problem.
The person gradually becomes better at throwing things away, learning that nothing terrible happens when they do and becomes better at organising items they insist on keeping.
At the end of treatment, the person may not have cleared all their clutter, but they will have gained a better understanding of their problem. They will have a plan to help them continue to build on their successes and avoid slipping back into their old ways."
Who's affected?,"Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects people between 20 and 40 years of age and those over 75. Slightly more men than women are affected.
Around 2,100 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year."
Causes of Hodgkin lymphoma,"The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:
you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system
you take immunosuppressant medicine
you've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever
You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.
Read more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma."
How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed,"The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy.
This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.
Read more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma."
Treatment and outlook,"Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.
The main treatments used are chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition.
Overall, around 8 out of 10 people with Hodgkin lymphoma live at least 5 years and most of these will be cured. However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.

Who can benefit from home oxygen therapy?,"Home oxygen therapy can be useful for people who do not have enough oxygen in their blood.
It can help with conditions such as:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
pulmonary fibrosis
heart failure
severe long-term asthma
pulmonary hypertension
cystic fibrosis
breathing problems caused by a combination of being obese and having an underlying condition"
Getting assessed for home oxygen therapy,"Your doctor will refer you to a specialist clinic if they think your symptoms can be helped by home oxygen therapy.
To check the amount of oxygen in your blood, you may have a blood test and an oxygen sensor may be attached to your finger or earlobe (a pulse oximetry test).
You may also be asked to do an exercise or a walking test to check if you'll benefit from home oxygen therapy."
Using home oxygen therapy,"The main ways of using home oxygen therapy are through:
short tubes placed in your nostrils – this is called a nasal cannula
a mask over your nose and mouth
There are 3 types of devices that can be used to give you oxygen:
an oxygen concentrator
large oxygen cylinders
portable cylinders
An engineer will install the equipment and explain how to use it safely.
Oxygen concentrator machine
An oxygen concentrator is recommended if you need to have oxygen for most of the day (including when you're asleep).
The machine is about the size of a bedside table and plugs into an electrical socket.
Large oxygen cylinders
Oxygen cylinders will probably be prescribed if you only need oxygen for a short time – for example, if you need to relieve sudden periods of breathlessness.
Portable oxygen cylinders
It may be possible to use a small, portable oxygen cylinder outside your house or when moving around at home. This is called portable oxygen or ambulatory oxygen.
Most portable oxygen cylinders weigh around 2-3kg and are small enough to fit inside a small backpack or shopping trolley. This size cylinder holds up to 3 hours' worth of oxygen.
Portable oxygen cylinders are not suitable for everyone."
Oxygen suppliers,"There are 4 companies in England that provide home oxygen services for the NHS. Each covers a different geographical area. You can contact your supplier if you have a question about your device.
Air Liquide:
0808 143 9991 for London
0808 143 9999 for the South West of England
Baywater Healthcare: covers the North West of England, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands and Wales (0800 373 580)
BOC: covers the East of England, East Midlands and Northern Ireland
Vivisol: covers the North East of England and the South East of England (0800 917 9840)"
Going on holiday,"As long as you're well enough to travel and you plan in advance, you should be able to go on holiday while using oxygen.
Speak to staff at your local clinic as soon as possible if you're thinking about going on holiday, particularly if you want to go abroad.
They can advise you about what you need to do to stay safe while you're away.
You will also need travel insurance.
If you're going on holiday in the UK, talk to your oxygen supplier to see if it's possible for oxygen to be delivered to your destination. Try to give them as much notice as possible.
Find out more about going on holiday with a lung condition on the Asthma and Lung UK website"
Using oxygen safely,"Do
keep the room you are using the device in well ventilated
install fire alarms and smoke detectors in your home and make sure they're working
tell your local fire brigade that you have oxygen at home who can then arrange a free fire safety check
keep your device at least 3 metres away from any appliances that use an open flame, such as a gas cooker or gas fire
keep your device at least 1.5 metres away from other electrical appliances, such as a television, hair dryer or heat sources, such as radiators or electrical heaters
Don’t
do not smoke, or let anyone smoke near you, when using your device – also smoking will make your oxygen therapy far less effective
do not use flammable liquids, such as cleaning fluid, paint thinner or aerosols when using your device
do not use oil-based emollients, such as Vaseline, when using your device as this can be a fire risk – your care team or pharmacist should be able to recommend alternative products"
What is homeopathy?,"Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine. This means that homeopathy is different from treatments that are part of conventional Western medicine in important ways.
It's based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann.
A central principle of the ""treatment"" is that ""like cures like"" – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those symptoms.
A second central principle is based around a process of dilution and shaking called succussion.
Practitioners believe that the more a substance is diluted in this way, the greater its power to treat symptoms.
Many homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have been diluted many times in water until there's none, or almost none, of the original substance left.
Homeopathy is used to ""treat"" an extremely wide range of conditions, including physical conditions such as asthma and psychological conditions such as depression."
Does homeopathy work?,There's been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy. There's no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition.
Is homeopathy available on the NHS?,"Homeopathy isn't widely available on the NHS. In 2017, NHS England recommended that GPs and other prescribers should stop providing it.
This is because they found ""no clear or robust evidence to support the use of homeopathy on the NHS (PDF, 607kb)"".
In 2018 a High Court ruling backed NHS England's recommendation after the British Homeopathic Association (BHA) challenged the decision.
Homeopathy is usually practised privately, and homeopathic remedies are available from pharmacies.
The price for a consultation with a homeopath can vary from around £30 to £125. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around £4 to £10."
What should I expect if I try it?,"When you first see a homeopath, they'll usually ask you about any specific health conditions and your general wellbeing, emotional state, lifestyle, and diet.
Based on this, the homeopath will decide on the course of treatment, which often takes the form of homeopathic remedies given as a pill, capsule or tincture (solution).
Your homeopath may recommend that you attend one or more follow-up appointments so the remedy's effects on your health can be assessed."
When is it used?,"Homeopathy is used for an extremely wide range of health conditions. Many practitioners believe it can help with any condition.
Among the most common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for are:
asthma
ear infections
hay fever
mental health conditions, such as depression, stress and anxiety
allergies, such as food allergies
dermatitis (an allergic skin condition)

There's no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions.
Some practitioners also claim homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases. There's no evidence to support this, and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises the NHS on the use of treatments, doesn't recommend using homeopathy in the treatment of any health condition."
What are the regulation issues?,"There's no legal regulation of homeopathic practitioners in the UK. This means that anyone can practise as a homeopath, even if they have no qualifications or experience.
Voluntary regulation aims to protect patient safety, but it doesn't mean there's scientific evidence that a treatment is effective."
Is homeopathy safe?,"Homeopathic remedies are generally safe, and the risk of a serious adverse side effect arising from taking these remedies is thought to be small.
Some homeopathic remedies may contain substances that aren't safe or interfere with the action of other medicines.
You should talk to your GP before stopping any treatment prescribed by a doctor, or avoiding procedures such as vaccination, in favour of homeopathy."
The evidence on the effects of homeopathy,"There have been several reviews of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy.
In 2010 the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee said there's no evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition.
There's no evidence behind the idea that substances that cause certain symptoms can also help treat them.
Nor is there any evidence behind the idea that diluting and shaking substances in water can turn those substances into medicines.
The ideas that underpin homeopathy aren't accepted by mainstream science, and aren't consistent with long-accepted principles on the way the physical world works.
The Committee's 2010 report on homeopathy said the ""like cures like"" principle is ""theoretically weak"", and that this is the ""settled view of medical science"".
For example, many homeopathic remedies are diluted to such an extent that it's unlikely there's a single molecule of the original substance remaining in the final remedy. In cases like these, homeopathic remedies consist of nothing but water.
Some homeopaths believe that, as a result of the succussion process, the original substance leaves an ""imprint"" of itself on the water. But there's no known mechanism by which this can occur.
The 2010 report said: ""We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions can maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in them to be scientifically implausible.""
Some people who use homeopathy may see an improvement in their health condition as the result of a phenomenon known as the placebo effect.
If you choose health treatments that provide only a placebo effect, you may miss out on other treatments that have been proven to be more effective."
Diagnosing homocystinuria,"At around 5 days old, babies are offered a newborn blood spot test to check if they have HCU. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.
If HCU is diagnosed, treatment can be given to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment may include trial doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), a special diet and advice.
With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with HCU are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for HCU must be continued for life.
Babies born with HCU don't usually have any symptoms in the first year of their life. But severe symptoms can develop later in life without early treatment. These may include:
vision problems, such as severe short-sightedness (myopia)
weak bones (osteoporosis)
bone and joint problems
a risk of developing blood clots and strokes
Some children with untreated HCU are also at risk of brain damage, and their development might be affected."
Treating homocystinuria,"Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)
In some babies, it's possible to control the levels of homocysteine with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). If this works, your child will need to take vitamin B6 supplements for the rest of their life.
Diet
Children diagnosed with HCU that doesn't respond to vitamin B6 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of methionine your baby receives.
High-protein foods need to be limited, including:
meat
fish
cheese
eggs
pulses
nuts
Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.
Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Special formula milk may be used. The diet will be designed to contain all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.
As your baby moves on to solid foods, your dietitian can explain which low-protein foods are suitable. Some of these may be available on prescription, including low-protein rusks, milk substitutes and low-protein pasta.
People with HCU may need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.
Regular blood tests will also be needed to monitor the amount of homocysteine in their blood.
Medicine
Alongside a low-protein diet, your child may be prescribed a medicine called betaine in later childhood to help clear some of the excess homocysteine.
Medicine for HCU needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor."
How homocystinuria is inherited,"The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for HCU is passed on by parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.
The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of HCU.
If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:
a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition
a 2 in 4 chance of being a carrier of HCU
a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes
Although it's not possible to prevent HCU, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition.
Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.
You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for information and advice about genetic conditions."
Information about your child,"If your child has HCU, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about NCARDRS on GOV.UK."
A pharmacist can help with worm infections,"A pharmacist can help if you have:
small, white worms in your poo that look like pieces of thread
extreme itching around your anus, particularly at night
This is probably threadworms.
They're common in the UK and can be treated with medicine from a pharmacy.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment to get rid of worms,"It does not matter which type of worm you have – all worm infections are treated in a similar way.
You might be asked to provide a sample of poo so it can be tested for worm eggs.
If you have worms, a GP will prescribe medicine to kill them. You take this for 1 to 3 days. The people you live with may also need to be treated.
Any worms in your gut will eventually pass out in your poo. You may not notice this.
To avoid becoming infected again or infecting others, it's very important during the weeks after starting treatment to wash your hands:
after going to the toilet
before eating or preparing food
regularly during the day
Important
Go back to the GP if your symptoms do not get better in 2 weeks or you keep passing live worms in your poo."
How you catch worms,"Worms are mainly spread in small bits of poo from people with a worm infection. Some are caught from food.
You can get infected by:
touching objects or surfaces with worm eggs on them – if someone with worms does not wash their hands
touching soil or swallowing water or food with worm eggs in it – mainly a risk in parts of the world without modern toilets or sewage systems
walking barefoot on soil containing worms – only a risk in parts of the world without modern toilets or sewage systems
eating raw or undercooked beef, pork or freshwater fish (like salmon or trout) containing baby worms – more common in parts of the world with poor food hygiene standards
You can catch some worms from pets, but this is rare."
How to prevent worm infections,"There are some things you can do to help prevent worm infections.
Do
wash your hands before eating or preparing food, and after touching soil or using the toilet
only drink bottled or boiled water in high-risk areas (places without modern toilets or sewage systems)
thoroughly wash garden-grown fruit and vegetables
deworm pet dogs and cats regularly
dispose of dog and cat poo in a bin as soon as possible
Don’t
do not let children play in areas where there's dog or cat poo
do not eat raw fruit and vegetables in high-risk areas
do not walk barefoot in high-risk areas
do not eat raw or undercooked pork, beef or freshwater fish"
Symptoms of human papillomavirus (HPV),"HPV does not usually cause any symptoms.
Most people who have it do not realise and do not have any problems.
But sometimes the virus can cause painless growths or lumps around your vagina, penis or anus (genital warts)."
How human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread,"Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch.
You do not need to have penetrative sex.
You can get HPV from:
any skin-to-skin contact of the genital area
vaginal, anal or oral sex
sharing sex toys
HPV has no symptoms, so you may not know if you have it.
It's very common. Most people will get some type of HPV in their life.
Important
You do not have to have sexual contact with a lot of people to get HPV. You can get HPV the first time you have sex."
Conditions linked to human papillomavirus (HPV),"Most of the time HPV does not cause any problems.
In some people, some types of HPV can cause:
genital warts
abnormal changes in the cells that can sometimes turn into cancer
HPV types linked to cancer are called high-risk types.
Cancers linked to high-risk HPV include:
cervical cancer
anal cancer
penile cancer
vulval cancer
vaginal cancer
some types of head and neck cancer
You can have HPV for many years without it causing problems.
You can have it even if you have not been sexually active or had a new partner for many years."
Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV),"HPV testing is part of cervical screening. There's no blood test for HPV.
During cervical screening, a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and tested for HPV.
Screening is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64. It helps protect them against cervical cancer.
Some sexual health clinics may offer anal screening to men with a higher risk of developing anal cancer, such as men who have sex with men."
How to protect yourself against human papillomavirus (HPV),"You cannot fully protect yourself against HPV, but there are things that can help.
Condoms can help protect you against HPV, but they do not cover all the skin around your genitals, so you're not fully protected.
The HPV vaccine protects against the types of HPV that cause most cases of genital warts and cervical cancer, as well as some other cancers. It does not protect against all types of HPV."
Treating human papillomavirus (HPV) infections,"There's no treatment for HPV. Most HPV infections do not cause any problems and are cleared by your body within 2 years.
Treatment is needed if HPV causes problems like genital warts or changes to cells in the cervix."
Symptoms,"The symptoms usually start at 30 to 50 years of age, but can begin much earlier or later.
Symptoms of Huntington's disease can include:
difficulty concentrating and memory lapses
depression
stumbling and clumsiness
involuntary jerking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body
mood swings and personality changes
problems swallowing, speaking and breathing
difficulty moving
Full-time nursing care is needed in the later stages of the condition.
Read more about the symptoms of Huntington's disease."
How it's inherited,"Huntington's disease is caused by a faulty gene that results in parts of the brain becoming gradually damaged over time.
You're usually only at risk of developing it if one of your parents has or had it. Both men and women can get it.
If a parent has the Huntington's disease gene, there's a:
1 in 2 (50%) chance of each of their children developing the condition – affected children are also able to pass the gene to any children they have
1 in 2 (50%) chance of each of their children never developing the condition – unaffected children can't pass the condition on to any children they have
Very occasionally, it's possible to develop Huntington's disease without having a history of it in your family. But this is usually just because one of your parents was never diagnosed with it."
When to get medical advice,"Speak to your GP for advice if:
you're worried you might have symptoms of Huntington's disease – especially if someone in your family has or had it
you have a history of the condition in your family and you want to find out if you will get it, too
you have a history of the condition in your family and you're planning a pregnancy
Your GP may refer you to a specialist for tests to check for Huntington's disease."
Treatment and support,"There's currently no cure for Huntington's disease or any way to stop it getting worse.
But treatment and support can help reduce some of the problems it causes, such as:
medicines for depression, mood swings and involuntary movements
occupational therapy to help make everyday tasks easier
speech and language therapy for feeding and communication problems
physiotherapy to help with movement and balance
Read more about treatment and support for Huntington's disease."
Further information and advice,"Living with Huntington's disease can be very distressing and frustrating for the person with the condition, as well as their loved ones and carers.
You may find The Huntington's Disease Association a useful source of information and support.
They offer:
information about Huntington's disease

Symptoms of hydrocephalus,"The damage to the brain from hydrocephalus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:
headache
being sick
blurred vision
difficulty walking
Different types of hydrocephalus can cause specific symptoms.
Read more about the symptoms of hydrocephalus."
Types of hydrocephalus,"There are 3 main types of hydrocephalus:
congenital hydrocephalus – hydrocephalus that's present at birth
acquired hydrocephalus – hydrocephalus that develops after birth
normal pressure hydrocephalus – usually only develops in older people
Hydrocephalus present from birth
Congenital hydrocephalus is when a baby is born with excess fluid in their brain.
It can be caused by a condition such as spina bifida, or an infection the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella (German measles).
Many babies born with hydrocephalus (congenital hydrocephalus) have permanent brain damage.
This can cause several long-term complications, such as:
learning disabilities
speech problems
memory problems
short attention span
problems with organisational skills
vision problems, such as a squint and vision loss
problems with physical coordination
epilepsy
If your child has learning disabilities, they'll need extra support from their nursery or school to ensure their needs are being met.
Hydrocephalus that develops in children or adults
Acquired hydrocephalus can affect children or adults. It usually develops after an illness or injury.
For example, it may happen after a serious head injury or as a complication of a medical condition, such as a brain tumour.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon and poorly understood condition that most often affects people over the age of 60.
It can sometimes develop after an injury or a stroke, but in most cases the cause is unknown.
Mobility problems, dementia and urinary incontinence are the main symptoms of NPH. But because these symptoms happen gradually and are similar to those of other, more common conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, NPH can be difficult to diagnose."
Diagnosing hydrocephalus,"Brain scans, such as CT scans and MRI scans, can be used to diagnose congenital and acquired hydrocephalus.
A checklist is used to help diagnose NPH. For example, how you walk, your mental ability and symptoms that affect your bladder control will be assessed.
It's important to diagnose NPH correctly because, unlike Alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms can be relieved with treatment.
Read more about diagnosing hydrocephalus."
Treating hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus can usually be treated using a thin tube (shunt) that's surgically implanted in the brain and drains away the excess fluid.
An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) can sometimes be used as an alternative to shunt surgery.
During this procedure, a hole is made in the floor of the brain to allow the trapped fluid to escape to the surface, where it can be absorbed.
Read more about how hydrocephalus is treated."
Complications after surgery,"The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus can sometimes cause complications. For example, a shunt can become blocked or infected.
Before having surgery, your surgeon should discuss the possible complications with you.
Read more about the complications of surgery for hydrocephalus."
What causes hydrocephalus?,"In the past, hydrocephalus was referred to as ""water on the brain"". However, the brain is not surrounded by water but by a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
CSF has 3 important functions:
it protects the brain from damage
it removes waste products from the brain
it provides the brain with the nutrients it needs to function properly
The brain constantly produces new CSF (about a pint a day), while old fluid is released from the brain and absorbed into the blood vessels.
But if this process is interrupted, the amount of CSF can quickly build up, cause pressure in the brain.
Read more about the causes of hydrocephalus."
Help and support,"If you have a child with hydrocephalus, or if you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by hydrocephalus.
Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with the details of local support groups and organisations.
You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website."
Antenatal hydronephrosis in babies,"Antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) is increasingly being found in unborn babies during routine ultrasound scans.
It's estimated to show up on at least 1 in every 100 pregnancies.
As a parent, it can be worrying to learn your baby has a problem with their kidneys. But most cases of hydronephrosis in babies are not serious and should not affect the outcome of your pregnancy. Sometimes, babies born with ANH may need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent kidney infections, but most babies born with ANH will have no lasting problems.
Find out more about diagnosing antenatal hydronephrosis and treating antenatal hydronephrosis."
Signs and symptoms,"Antenatal hydronephrosis does not usually cause any symptoms. It is often found during pre-natal scans or in tests that are being done for other reasons.
Symptoms for children and adults can include:
pain in your back or side – this may be sudden and severe, or may be a dull ache that comes and goes over time; it may get worse after you have drunk a lot of fluid
symptoms of a UTI, such as needing to pee more often, pain or a burning sensation while peeing, and feeling tired and unwell
blood in your urine
urinating less often than you used to or with a weak stream
You should see your doctor or contact 111 if you have any of these symptoms.
They may refer you for an ultrasound scan to assess your kidneys.
Antenatal hydronephrosis in babies does not usually cause symptoms after birth, but you should seek medical advice as soon as possible if your baby develops signs of a possible UTI, such as a high fever without any other obvious cause.
Find out about diagnosing hydronephrosis."
What causes hydronephrosis?,"Antenatal hydronephrosis
Antenatal hydronephrosis diagnosed in pregnancy is usually mild. It's thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of urine your baby produces in the later stages of pregnancy.
In more severe cases, it may be caused by a blockage in the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, or a blockage in the flow of urine out of the bladder.
Adult hydronephrosis
In adults, hydronephrosis is commonly caused by:
kidney stones
pregnancy (maternal hydronephrosis)
an enlarged prostate gland in men
narrowing of the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder) caused by injury, infection or surgery
some types of cancer, including kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer or ovarian cancer
Find out about the causes of hydronephrosis."
Treating hydronephrosis,"If you have hydronephrosis, your treatment will depend on what's causing the condition and how severe it is. 
Pregnant women and babies with the condition may not require any treatment.
In adults, the first stage of treatment is often to drain the urine out of your kidneys by inserting a tube called a catheter into your bladder or kidneys.
This will help relieve the pressure on your kidneys.
Once the pressure has been relieved, the cause of the build-up of urine may need to be treated.
The treatments used will depend on why the condition developed.
For example:
kidney stones may be removed during an operation or broken up using sound waves
an enlarged prostate can be treated with medication or surgery to remove some of the prostate
blockages in the ureters can be treated using surgery to insert a small tube called a stent
cancer may be treated using a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous tissue
Find out about how hydronephrosis is treated."
Check if you have hyperacusis,"You may have hyperacusis if some everyday sounds seem much louder than they should. It can sometimes be painful.
You may be affected by sounds like:
jingling coins
a barking dog
a car engine
someone chewing
a vacuum cleaner
Your sensitivity to noise can affect relationships, school or work and your general wellbeing.
Hyperacusis can affect 1 or both ears. It can come on suddenly or develop over time."
Treatment for hyperacusis,"If hyperacusis is caused by another condition, such as migraines or Lyme disease, treating the condition may stop your hyperacusis.
If there's no clear cause, you may be offered treatment to help make you less sensitive to everyday sounds.
This could be:
sound therapy to get you used to everyday sounds again, and may involve wearing ear pieces that make white noise
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to change the way you think about your hyperacusis and reduce anxiety"
Things you can try to ease hyperacusis,"Do
try some relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises
Don’t
do not use earplugs or muffs unless you really need to
do not avoid noisy situations, as this will make you become even more sensitive to noise"
Causes of hyperacusis,"The cause of hyperacusis is unclear.
It can appear on its own or after hearing a sudden loud noise, such as fireworks.
It can also appear alongside other conditions, like:
tinnitus
a head injury
Ménière's disease
Bell's palsy
Lyme disease
migraines
Williams syndrome
autism
Children are often more sensitive to loud noises than adults. It often gets better as they get older.
But some children may become more sensitive to noise than others after having an ear infection, for example, or if they have another condition, such as autism."
Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism,"Hyperparathyroidism affects people differently. Some people have mild or no symptoms, while others have many.
The symptoms may not relate to the level of calcium in your blood. For example, some people with a slightly raised calcium level may have symptoms, while others with high calcium levels may have few or no symptoms at all.
A diagnosis may be missed or delayed because there are no symptoms or they are vague, like feeling tired, and thought to be caused by another condition.
Possible signs of hyperparathyroidism include:
depression
tiredness
feeling thirsty and peeing a lot
feeling sick and losing your appetite
muscle weakness
constipation
tummy pain
loss of concentration
mild confusion
Symptoms of hypercalcaemia
If hyperparathyroidism is not treated, it can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcaemia), which may cause:
being sick (vomiting)
drowsiness
dehydration
confusion
muscle spasms
bone pain or tenderness
joint pain
irregular heartbeat
high blood pressure (hypertension)
Hypercalcaemia can also cause other complications, including:
osteoporosis and bone fractures
kidney stones and blockage, and kidney damage or failure
stomach ulcers (gastric or peptic ulcers)
pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
In very severe cases of hyperparathyroidism, high calcium levels can lead to rapid kidney failure, loss of consciousness, coma, or serious life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities.
But hyperparathyroidism is usually diagnosed at an early stage in the UK, and these complications are extremely rare."
Diagnosing hyperparathyroidism,"It's important that hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed as soon as possible. Without treatment, it can gradually get worse and may lead to complications.
But in most cases, the condition is mild to moderate and remains stable for years.
Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows:
high levels of parathyroid hormone
high levels of blood calcium, often with low levels of phosphorus
A DEXA scan (a bone density X-ray) can help detect bone loss, fractures or bone softening, and X-rays, CT scans or ultrasound scans may show calcium deposits or kidney stones."
Types of hyperparathyroidism,"There are 3 types of hyperparathyroidism.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is when there's a problem within the parathyroid gland itself, usually a benign (non-cancerous) tumour of the gland.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is when the glands are fine but a condition, like kidney failure, lowers calcium levels and causes the body to react by producing extra parathyroid hormone.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is when long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism starts to behave like primary hyperparathyroidism.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is often associated with very advanced kidney failure (usually requiring dialysis).
People with tertiary hyperparathyroidism are almost always under the care of kidney specialists.
Causes of primary hyperparathyroidism
In 4 out of 5 cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a non-cancerous tumour called an adenoma on one of the parathyroid glands.
Less commonly, it can occur if 2 or more parathyroid glands become enlarged (hyperplasia).
Very rarely, primary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland.
Women are more likely to develop primary hyperparathyroidism than men, and most people who develop it are over 60."
Treating primary hyperparathyroidism,"Surgery to remove the parathyroid gland is usually the only way of treating primary hyperparathyroidism.
If your calcium levels are very high, you may need to be admitted to hospital urgently if you have lost a lot of fluids (dehydration). You may need to have fluids through an intravenous drip.
Medicine called bisphosphonates may also be given to lower calcium. These are only used as a short-term treatment. Surgery will be needed once the calcium levels are stabilised.
For people who are unable to have surgery – for example, because of other medical conditions or they're too frail – a tablet called cinacalcet may be used to help control the condition.
Make sure you have a healthy, balanced diet.
You do not need to avoid calcium altogether. A lack of dietary calcium is more likely to lead to a loss of calcium from your skeleton, resulting in brittle bones (osteoporosis).
But you should avoid a high-calcium diet and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.
Medicines such as thiazide diuretics (water tablets commonly used to treat high blood pressure) should be avoided because they can cause dehydration and raise calcium levels."
Treating secondary hyperparathyroidism,"Treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause.
Low vitamin D is the most common cause and can be corrected with oral vitamin D (colecalciferol).
Another common cause is kidney disease."
Treating tertiary hyperparathyroidism,Surgery is usually the main treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism that occurs in very advanced kidney failure.
Symptoms of an overactive thyroid,"An overactive thyroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:
nervousness, anxiety and irritability
mood swings
difficulty sleeping
persistent tiredness and weakness
sensitivity to heat
swelling in your neck from an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)
an irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (palpitations)
twitching or trembling
weight loss
Find out more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid.
They'll ask about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem, they can arrange for a blood test to check how well your thyroid is working.
If the blood test shows that you have an overactive thyroid, you may be referred for further tests to identify the cause.
Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is diagnosed"
Treatments for an overactive thyroid,"An overactive thyroid is usually treatable.
The main treatments are:
medicine that stops your thyroid producing too much of the thyroid hormones
radioiodine treatment – where a type of radiotherapy is used to destroy cells in the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce thyroid hormones
surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid, so that it no longer produces thyroid hormones
Each of these treatments has benefits and drawbacks. You'll usually see a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to discuss which treatment is best for you.
Find out more about how an overactive thyroid is treated"
Causes of an overactive thyroid,"There are several reasons why your thyroid can become overactive.
These include:
Graves' disease – an autoimmune condition where the immune system produces antibodies that cause the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone (about 4 in every 5 people with an overactive thyroid have Graves' disease)
lumps (nodules) on the thyroid – this extra thyroid tissue can produce thyroid hormones, causing your levels to be too high
some medicines such as amiodarone, which can be used to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
Find out more about the causes of an overactive thyroid"
Further problems,"An overactive thyroid can sometimes lead to further problems, particularly if it's not treated or well controlled.
These include:
eye problems – such as eye irritation, double vision or bulging eyes
pregnancy complications – such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth or miscarriage
a thyroid storm – a sudden and life-threatening flare-up of symptoms

What happens in a hypnotherapy session,"There are different types of hypnotherapy, and different ways of hypnotising someone.
First, you'll usually have a talk with your therapist to discuss what you hope to achieve and agree what methods your therapist will use.
After this, the hypnotherapist may:
lead you into a deeply relaxed state
use your agreed methods to help you towards your goals – for example, suggesting that you do not want to carry out a certain habit
gradually bring you out of the trance-like state – most people feel refreshed and relaxed
You're fully in control when under hypnosis and do not have to take on the therapist's suggestions if you do not want to.
If necessary, you can bring yourself out of the hypnotic state.
Hypnosis does not work if you do not want to be hypnotised.
Important
Do not use hypnotherapy if you have psychosis or certain types of personality disorder, as it could make your condition worse.
Check with a GP first if you've got a personality disorder."
Can I get hypnotherapy on the NHS?,"Hypnotherapy is not usually available on the NHS.
To find out if you can see a hypnotherapist on the NHS in your area, ask:
a GP
your local integrated care board (ICB)"
Finding a private hypnotherapist,"In the UK, hypnotherapists do not have to have any specific training by law.
This means hypnotherapy can be offered by people with little training who are not health professionals.
When looking for a private hypnotherapist:
choose someone with a healthcare background – such as a doctor, psychologist or counsellor
if you have mental ill health or a serious illness (such as cancer), make sure they're trained in working with your condition
if you're looking for a therapist for your child, make sure they're trained to work with children
check they're registered with an organisation that's accredited by the Professional Standards Authority
Find a hypnotherapist through the Professional Standards Authority
A private hypnotherapy session can cost from £50 upwards."
Check if you have low blood sugar,"Low blood sugar usually affects people with diabetes who take insulin or some other diabetes medicines. It's rare in people without diabetes.
Symptoms of low blood sugar can include:
feeling hungry
feeling dizzy
feeling anxious or irritable
sweating
shaking
tingling lips
heart palpitations
feeling tired or weak
changes in your vision such as blurred vision
feeling confused
If you have severe low blood sugar you may:
have a seizure or fit
become unconscious
Important:
Checking your blood sugar
If you have diabetes and get any symptoms of low blood sugar, check your blood sugar if you can. If it's below 4mmol/L you'll need to take steps to treat it."
How to treat low blood sugar yourself,"If you have diabetes and get symptoms of low blood sugar (a hypo) or your blood sugar is below 4mmol/L:
Eat or drink something that will raise your blood sugar quickly, such as a small glass of fruit juice or sugary fizzy drink, 5 glucose or dextrose tablets, 4 large jelly babies, or 2 tubes of glucose gel.
Check your blood sugar after 10 to 15 minutes.
If your blood sugar is still below 4mmol/L, have another sugary drink or snack, and check again after 10 minutes.
Once your symptoms have improved and your blood sugar is above 4mmol/L, eat something that will keep your blood sugar up for longer, such as some biscuits, a sandwich, or your next meal if it's due.
How to treat severe low blood sugar
If someone has very low blood sugar (a severe hypo) and becomes unconscious:
Do not give them any food or drink as they will not be able to swallow safely.
Put them into the recovery position.
Give them a glucagon injection straight away, if one is available and you know how to use it.
If they start to recover within 10 minutes of having a glucagon injection and can swallow safely, give them some food or drink that will raise their blood sugar.
Stay with them until they're fully recovered."
How to reduce your risk of low blood sugar,"If you take medicine for diabetes, there are things you can do to reduce the risk of low blood sugar.
Do
follow the treatment plan agreed with your diabetes care team, including adjusting your insulin dose when you need to
check your blood sugar regularly
carry something with you that will raise your blood sugar quickly, such as sugary drinks, sweets or glucose tablets
carry a glucagon injection kit and medical ID with you
make sure your family and friends know how to treat severe low blood sugar
ask your care team about getting a continuous glucose monitor or flash monitor if you do not already have one
if you have type 1 diabetes and often have problems with low blood sugar, ask your diabetes care team about switching to an insulin pump
Don’t
do not skip or delay meals
do not drink too much alcohol – keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, spread over 3 days or more
do not drink alcohol without eating"
How you get low blood sugar,"If you have diabetes
Diabetes causes high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia). Diabetes medicines treat your condition by lowering your blood sugar, but they can sometimes make it go too low.
This is common if you take insulin. It can also happen with some other diabetes medicines, such as gliclazide and glimepiride.
You're more likely to get low blood sugar if you:
take too much insulin
have problems with the way you inject insulin, such as injecting in the same place too often
miss or delay meals, or do not eat enough carbohydrate
do a lot of exercise without eating more carbohydrate or reducing your insulin dose
drink a lot of alcohol, particularly without eating
Sometimes it's not clear why it happens.
If you do not have diabetes
It's rare to get low blood sugar if you do not have diabetes. It can sometimes be caused by conditions including:
malnutrition
Addison's disease
a growth (tumour) in your pancreas"
Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism,"The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism can include:
a tingling sensation (paraesthesia) in your fingertips, toes and lips
twitching facial muscles
muscle pains or cramps, particularly in your legs, feet or tummy
tiredness
mood changes, such as feeling irritable, anxious or depressed
dry, rough skin
coarse hair that breaks easily and can fall out
fingernails that break easily"
Diagnosing hypoparathyroidism,"Hypoparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test has shown:
low parathyroid hormone levels
low calcium levels
high phosphorus levels"
Treating hypoparathyroidism,"Treatment for hypoparathyroidism aims to relieve your symptoms and bring the levels of calcium and other minerals in your blood back to normal.
The normal calcium range is around 2.2 to 2.6 millimoles per litre (mmol/L). You'll be advised to keep your calcium levels in a slightly lower range – for example, 1.8 to 2.25mmol/L. Your recommended range will depend on your circumstances.
Calcium carbonate and vitamin D supplements – usually calcitriol (Rocaltrol) or alfacalcidol (One-Alpha) – can be taken to restore your blood calcium to these levels. They usually have to be taken for life.
You'll also need to have regular blood tests to monitor your parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus levels.
If your blood calcium levels fall to a dangerously low level or you keep having muscle spasms, you may need to be given calcium through a drip directly into your vein.
Dietary advice
It's also recommended that you follow a high-calcium, low-phosphorus diet.
Good sources of calcium include:
milk, cheese and other dairy foods
leafy green vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and okra – but not spinach
soya beans
tofu
soya drinks with added calcium
nuts
bread and anything made with fortified flour
fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards
Phosphorus is found in:
red meat
dairy
fish
poultry
bread
rice
oats"
Causes of hypoparathyroidism,"The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is removal of or accidental injury to the parathyroid glands during surgery to the neck.
Other causes include:
autoimmune conditions, where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues – such as Addison's disease and pernicious anaemia
being born without parathyroid glands or with glands that don't work properly – for example, people with the inherited genetic disorder DiGeorge syndrome can have underdeveloped parathyroid glands
radiotherapy to treat throat or neck cancer
low blood magnesium levels – for example, because of alcohol misuse"
Check if it’s hypothermia,"Symptoms of hypothermia include:
shivering
pale, cold and dry skin – skin and lips may turn blue or grey (on black or brown skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet)
slurred speech
slow breathing
tiredness or confusion
A baby with hypothermia may be:
cold to touch
floppy
unusually quiet and sleepy and may refuse to feed"
What to do while you're waiting for help for hypothermia,"If you think someone has hypothermia, there are things you can do while waiting for medical help.
Do
move the person indoors or somewhere sheltered as quickly as possible
remove any wet clothing, wrap them in a blanket, sleeping bag or dry towel, making sure their head is covered
give them a warm non-alcoholic drink and some sugary food like chocolate if they're fully awake
keep them awake by talking to them until help arrives
make sure you or someone else stays with them
There are things you should not do because they will not help and could make things worse.
Don’t
do not use a hot bath, hot water bottle or heat lamp to warm them up
do not rub their arms, legs, feet or hands
do not give them alcohol to drink"
Treatment in hospital for hypothermia,"If you have hypothermia, you’ll usually be treated in hospital.
Your heart rate will be monitored and you may be given oxygen to help you breathe.
You may also be given warm fluids straight into a vein to help your body warm up.
Treatment in intensive care may be needed if you have severe hypothermia."
Causes of hypothermia,"Hypothermia happens when you get too cold and your body temperature drops below 35C.
You can get hypothermia if you:
do not wear enough clothes in cold weather
stay out in the cold too long
fall into cold water
have wet clothes and get cold
live in a cold house – older people living alone are particularly at risk"
When to see a GP,"Symptoms of an underactive thyroid are often similar to those of other conditions, and they usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years.
For example, if you are an age where you may be expecting the menopause, you may think you have started the menopause rather than having an underactive thyroid.
You should see a GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have symptoms including:
tiredness
weight gain
depression
being sensitive to the cold
dry skin and hair
muscle aches
The only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have a thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your hormone levels."
Who's affected,"Both men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although it's more common in women. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid and some babies are born with it.
All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism using a blood spot test when the baby is about 5 days old."
Treating an underactive thyroid,"Treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine, to raise your thyroxine levels.
You'll initially have regular blood tests until the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached. This can take a little while to get right.
Once you're taking the correct dose, you'll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.
You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.
If an underactive thyroid is not treated, it can lead to complications, including heart disease, goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare)."
The thyroid gland,"The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea).
One of its main functions is to produce hormones that help regulate the body's metabolism (the process that turns food into energy). These hormones are called triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).
Many of the body's functions slow down when the thyroid does not produce enough of these hormones.

Why do I need a hysterectomy?,"Hysterectomies are carried out to treat health problems that affect the female reproductive system.
These include:
heavy periods
long-term pelvic pain
non-cancerous tumours (fibroids)
ovarian cancer, womb cancer, cervical cancer or cancer of the fallopian tubes
A hysterectomy is a major operation with a long recovery time and is only considered after less invasive treatments have been tried.
Find out why a hysterectomy is needed"
Things to consider,"If you have a hysterectomy, as well as having your womb removed, you may have to decide whether to also have your cervix or ovaries removed.
Your decision will usually be based on your personal feelings, medical history and any recommendations your doctor may have.
Find out the things to consider before having a hysterectomy"
Types of hysterectomy,"There are various types of hysterectomy. The type you have depends on why you need the operation and how much of your womb and surrounding reproductive system can safely be left in place.
The main types of hysterectomy are:
total hysterectomy – the womb and cervix (neck of the womb) are removed; this is the most commonly performed operation
subtotal hysterectomy – the main body of the womb is removed, leaving the cervix in place
total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy – the womb, cervix, fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) and ovaries (oophorectomy) are removed
radical hysterectomy – the womb and surrounding tissues are removed, including the fallopian tubes, part of the vagina, ovaries, lymph glands and fatty tissue
There are 3 ways to carry out a hysterectomy:
laparoscopic hysterectomy (keyhole surgery) – where small cuts are made in the tummy and the womb is removed through a cut in the vagina
vaginal hysterectomy – where the womb is removed through a cut in the top of the vagina
abdominal hysterectomy – where the womb is removed through a cut in the lower tummy
Find out how a hysterectomy is performed"
Complications of a hysterectomy,"There's a small risk of complications, including:
heavy bleeding
infection
damage to your bladder or bowel
a serious reaction to the general anaesthetic
Find out more about the complications of a hysterectomy"
Recovering from a hysterectomy,"A hysterectomy is a major operation. You can be in hospital for up to 5 days after surgery, and it can take about 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover.
Recovery times can also vary depending on the type of hysterectomy.
Rest as much as possible during this time and do not lift anything heavy, such as bags of shopping. You need time for your abdominal muscles and tissues to heal.
Find out more about recovering from a hysterectomy"
Surgical menopause,"If your ovaries are removed during a hysterectomy, you'll go through the menopause immediately after the operation, regardless of your age. This is known as a surgical menopause.
If 1 or both of your ovaries are left intact, there's a chance you'll have the menopause sooner than you would have if you did not have a hysterectomy.
If you experience a surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy, you should be offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT)."
The female reproductive system,"The female reproductive system is made up of the:
womb (uterus) – a pear-shaped organ in the middle of your pelvis where a baby develops; the lining of the womb is shed during a period
cervix – the neck of the womb, where the womb meets the vagina; the cervix is the lower part of the womb and not separate
vagina – a muscular tube below the cervix
fallopian tubes – tubes that connect the womb to the ovaries
ovaries – small organs by the fallopian tubes that release an egg each month"
Why a hysteroscopy is done,"A hysteroscopy can be done to find out why you're having certain symptoms such as unexplained vaginal bleeding.
It can help diagnose or treat many different health issues, including:
very heavy periods or bleeding between periods
bleeding after the menopause
fibroids or small growths (polyps)
problems getting pregnant or repeated miscarriages
removal of a coil (IUS or IUD) if the threads are missing
Sometimes a sample of tissue (biopsy) is taken during a hysteroscopy, or fibroids and polyps are removed."
Preparing for a hysteroscopy,"A GP or hospital doctor can refer you for a hysteroscopy if they think you need one. You'll get printed information about the procedure, including details of pain relief options, or a link to where you can read this information online.
Before you go in for your hysteroscopy, let staff at the hospital or clinic know if you'd like to bring a friend or family member with you. There will also be a nurse or other trained member of staff with you during the test (a chaperone).
Pain relief options
Having a hysteroscopy can be uncomfortable and may feel like period pain. Taking ibuprofen or paracetamol 1 hour before the procedure can help.
However, some people find having a hysteroscopy very painful. If you're worried about pain, or have questions about pain relief, you may want to speak to staff at the hospital or clinic before the day of your hysteroscopy.
Tell them in advance if:
you have painful periods that make you faint
you've had painful vaginal examinations or cervical smears in the past
you've experienced sexual violence, which could make the procedure difficult for you
It may be possible to have a general anaesthetic or an injection to help you relax (intravenous sedation) during the hysteroscopy. Not all hospitals or clinics offer this, so you may need to be referred to one that does.
Before having a hysteroscopy with general anaesthetic or sedation, you'll be invited to a separate appointment for some health checks.
Important:
Do not have a hysteroscopy if you could be pregnant
Use contraception, or avoid sex, in the weeks between your last period and having your hysteroscopy.
You may also be given a pregnancy test on the day of the procedure."
How a hysteroscopy is done,"Before the hysteroscopy, you'll meet the healthcare professional who will be doing the procedure (the hysteroscopist).
They'll explain what will happen, including your pain relief options, and can answer any questions. They'll ask you to sign a consent form.
During your hysteroscopy, a thin tube with a small camera inside is inserted into your vagina, passed through your cervix and into your womb. Salt water (saline solution) is injected through the tube, to make it easier to see inside your womb.
The camera sends images to a screen, so the hysteroscopist can see what they're doing. You can also watch the screen if you want to.
You may feel sick or faint during the procedure.
If you're in a lot of discomfort or pain, you may be offered gas and air or a local anaesthetic to help with the pain. Or you can ask to stop the procedure at any time.
You may be able to have the test at a later date with local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic, or an injection to relax you (intravenous sedation).
A hysteroscopy usually takes 10 to 15 minutes but can take longer if any tissue samples are taken, or a fibroid or small growth is removed.
Afterwards, you'll be moved to a recovery area until you feel ready to go home.
Hysteroscopy with general anaesthetic or sedation
If you have a hysteroscopy with a general anaesthetic, you may need to stay in hospital overnight.
If you have a general anaesthetic or intravenous sedation, a friend or family member will need to collect you afterwards. Do not drive yourself."
Recovering from a hysteroscopy,"It's normal to have pain, similar to period pain, for a couple of days after a hysteroscopy. Taking paracetamol, ibuprofen or your usual period pain medicine should help.
You may also have some bleeding, or spots of blood (spotting), for up to a week. Use sanitary pads not tampons.
Avoid exercise or having sex until the pain and bleeding has stopped."
Possible complications of a hysteroscopy,"Most hysteroscopies are quick and safe, without any problems. But like any procedure there's a small chance that something can go wrong.
It happens rarely, but there's a risk of:
developing an infection afterwards – this can be treated with antibiotics
making a small hole in the wall of the womb when removing a polyp
If there's a hole in the wall of your womb after removing a polyp, you may need to stay in hospital overnight. This often gets better on its own, but sometimes an operation is needed to repair it.
Urgent advice:
Contact the hospital or clinic where you had the procedure urgently if:
you have bleeding that gets worse or does not stop after a few days
you have tummy pain that gets worse and painkillers or your usual period pain tablets have not helped
you have a high temperature
you have smelly vaginal discharge
You can also call 111 or get help from 111 online."
Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"The main symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can include:
diarrhoea that lasts longer than 4 weeks
tummy pain
blood or mucus (clear slime) in your poo
bleeding from your bottom
feeling tired all the time
losing weight without trying"
Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will depend on your symptoms. If you're very unwell, you may need to be treated in hospital.
Treatments may include:
medicines to help ease your symptoms, such as steroids, and other medicines that can help keep your symptoms under control
surgery to remove part of your bowel, if your symptoms are severe"
Causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"It's not clear what causes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed.
You're more likely to get IBD if one of your close relatives has it, for example, one of your parents, grandparents, or a sibling."

Check if it's ichthyosis,"The main symptom of ichthyosis is very dry, scaly skin that may also be thick and rough.
It usually affects large areas of the body including the arms, legs, torso, ears, face, or the whole body.
The symptoms are often there from birth, but they can also appear after a few months or years. Sometimes the symptoms appear later in life because of another health condition, or from taking certain medicines.

Ichthyosis can sometimes have more severe symptoms, including:
blistered skin
a thin yellow, shiny layer on the skin at birth that dries out and flakes off
hair loss
tight skin which can make moving the affected area painful
skin infections
sweating less, which can lead to overheating
problems with hearing or eyesight"
Treatments for ichthyosis,"Most types of ichthyosis cannot be cured, but there are treatments to help the symptoms.
Treatments may include:
moisturising treatments (emollients), such as lotions, creams, ointments and bath oils
peeling creams, such as salicylic acid
A skin specialist will talk to you about the different options.
For more severe ichthyosis symptoms treatment can also include:
antibiotics to treat or prevent skin infections
retinoid tablets or creams to help improve the appearance of scaly skin
If the ichthyosis symptoms are caused by another health condition or medicine, treating the condition or changing the medicine can improve the symptoms."
How to ease ichthyosis symptoms at home,"There are things you can do to help ease ichthyosis symptoms at home.
Do
use emollients on affected skin at least once a day – ideally when your skin is still wet after having a bath or shower
try different types of emollient to find 1 that works best
use a comb on wet hair to remove scaly skin on the scalp
talk to your skin specialist if any treatments cause irritation
Don’t
do not smoke or go near flames if using an emollient that contains paraffin
do not use soap on affected skin – use an emollient instead of soap"
Types of ichthyosis,"There are at least 20 different types of ichthyosis.
Most types are passed on from your parents in your genes, and you have symptoms from birth or soon after.
These include:
ichthyosis vulgaris – the most common type of ichthyosis, it's usually mild and can get better as you get older
X-linked ichthyosis – only happens in boys, tends to be better in sunny or warm weather
autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis – tends to have more severe symptoms
You can also get ichthyosis in later life because of another health condition, such as kidney disease, or as a reaction to certain medicines."
Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.
Symptoms can include:
shortness of breath
a persistent dry cough
tiredness
loss of appetite and weight loss
rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)
Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape.
But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you have struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than 3 weeks.
These symptoms are not normal and should not be ignored.
If a GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as:
breathing (lung function) tests
blood tests
a chest X-ray and CT scan
a lung biopsy, where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed
Find out more about the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"
Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred.
This causes the lungs to become stiff and makes it difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.
The reason this happens is not clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown.
IPF has been linked to:
exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust
viral infections
a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition
acid reflux
smoking
But it's not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF."
Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"There's currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.
Treatments include:
self care measures, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly
medicines to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib
breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you're at home or while you're out and about
exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily (pulmonary rehabilitation)
a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare
Find out more about how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated
Further information
UK Charities Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Trust provide information and support for people affected by IPF as well as news items about ongoing research into the condition."
Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable.
Some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating.
Other problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.
It's very difficult to predict how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis.
Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it's getting worse quickly or slowly."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have IPF, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS help scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat IPF. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Check if you have impetigo,"Impetigo starts with red sores or blisters, but the redness may be harder to see in brown and black skin.
The sores or blisters quickly burst and leave crusty, golden-brown patches.
The patches can:
look a bit like cornflakes stuck to your skin
get bigger
spread to other parts of your body
be itchy
sometimes be painful
Sores (non-bullous impetigo) or blisters (bullous impetigo) can start anywhere – but usually on exposed areas like your face and hands.
Credit:
The sores or blisters burst and form crusty patches.
Credit:"
Treatment for impetigo,"A GP or pharmacist will check it's not something more serious, like cellulitis.
If it's impetigo, you may need:
hydrogen peroxide cream if it's in one area
antibiotic cream or tablets if it's more widespread
antibiotic tablets if you have bullous impetigo or feel very unwell
Babies and people with a weakened immune system may need antibiotic tablets to stop the infection causing more serious problems.
If your impetigo keeps coming back
A GP can take a swab from your skin to check for the bacteria that causes impetigo. They may also take a swab from inside your nose.
They might prescribe an antiseptic body wash, nasal ointment, or both, to try to clear the bacteria and stop the impetigo coming back.
Important:
Make sure you finish treatment
Do not stop taking the antibiotic tablets early, even if the impetigo starts to clear up."
Stop impetigo spreading or getting worse,"Impetigo can easily spread to other parts of your body or to other people until it stops being contagious.
It stops being contagious:
48 hours after you start using hydrogen peroxide cream or antibiotics prescribed by your GP
when the patches dry out and crust over (if you do not get treatment)
To help stop impetigo spreading or getting worse while it's still contagious:
Do
stay away from school or work
keep sores, blisters and crusty patches clean and dry
cover them with loose clothing or gauze bandages
wash your hands frequently
wash flannels, sheets and towels at a high temperature
wash or wipe down toys with detergent and warm water if your children have impetigo
Don’t
do not touch or scratch sores, blisters or crusty patches – this also helps stop scarring
do not have close contact with children or people with diabetes or a weakened immune system (if they're having chemotherapy, for example)
do not share flannels, sheets or towels
do not prepare food for other people
do not go to the gym
do not play contact sports like football"
How to avoid impetigo,"Impetigo usually infects skin that's already damaged.
To avoid spreading the infection to other areas of your body and to other people:
keep cuts, scratches and insect bites clean – for example, by washing them with warm water and soap
get treatment for skin conditions, like eczema"
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and you should not feel embarrassed talking to them about your symptoms.
This can also be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem.
Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with a GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may do a pelvic or rectal examination, depending on whether you have a vagina or a penis.
The GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate.
You may also be referred to a specialist for more tests.
Find out about diagnosing urinary incontinence."
Causes of urinary incontinence,"Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening of or damage to the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter.
Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder.
Overflow incontinence is often caused by an obstruction or blockage in your bladder, which prevents it from emptying fully.
Total incontinence may be caused by a problem with the bladder from birth, a spinal injury, or a small, tunnel like hole that can form between the bladder and a nearby area (fistula).
Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence, including:
pregnancy and vaginal birth
obesity
a family history of incontinence
increasing age – although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing
Find out more about the causes of urinary incontinence."
Treating urinary incontinence,"Non-surgical treatments
Initially, a GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms.
These may include:
lifestyle changes such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol
pelvic floor exercises, where you strengthen your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them
bladder training, where you learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine
You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and handheld urinals.
Medicine may be recommended if you're still unable to manage your symptoms.
Find out more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence.
Surgical treatments
Surgery may also be considered. The procedures that are suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have.
Surgical treatment for stress incontinence, such as a sling procedure, is used to reduce pressure on the bladder or strengthen the muscles that control urination.
Surgery to treat urge incontinence includes enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles.
Find out more about surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence."
Preventing urinary incontinence,"It's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it happening.
These include:
maintaining a healthy weight
changing your drinking habits, including cutting down on alcohol
doing pelvic floor muscle exercises
Healthy weight
Being obese can increase your risk of urinary incontinence. You may be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating.
Use the healthy weight calculator to see if you are a healthy weight for your height.
Get more information and advice about managing your weight.
Drinking habits
Depending on your particular bladder problem, a GP can advise you about the amount of fluids you should drink.
If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder.
The recommended weekly limit for alcohol consumption is 14 units.
A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.
Find out more about alcohol units.
If you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day.
Pelvic floor exercises
Being pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you're pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence.
Find out more about pelvic floor muscle exercises during pregnancy.
Everyone may benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles with pelvic floor exercises.

Check if you have indigestion,"Indigestion can be felt in different ways.
You can have the following symptoms after eating or drinking:
heartburn – a painful burning feeling in the chest, often after eating
feeling full and bloated
feeling sick
burping and farting
bringing up food or bitter-tasting fluids into your mouth
When it's not indigestion
Stomach ache or back pain are usually not symptoms of indigestion. If you have those you might be constipated."
How you can treat indigestion yourself,"There's usually no need to see a GP about indigestion. There are some things you can do at home.
Do
cut down on tea, coffee, cola or alcohol
raise your head and shoulders up when in bed – this can stop stomach acid coming up while you sleep
lose weight if you're overweight
Don’t
do not eat 3 to 4 hours before going to bed
do not have rich, spicy or fatty foods
do not take ibuprofen or aspirin unless it has been prescribed for you (speak to a pharmacist or GP if you take these medicines, as they can make indigestion worse)
do not smoke
A pharmacist can help with indigestion
A pharmacist can recommend medicines to ease the burning feeling or pain that can come with indigestion.
Medicines that can help with indigestion include:
antacids
alginates
proton pump inhibitors
Some indigestion medicines are best to take after eating as their effects last longer. Check the information leaflet that comes with the medicines for more information.
Find a pharmacy"
Pregnant women: treating indigestion,"Pregnant women often get indigestion. It's very common from 27 weeks onwards.
It can be caused by hormonal changes and the growing baby pressing against the stomach.
A pharmacist can help with uncomfortable feelings or pain. They can recommend the best medicines to use when you're pregnant."
What causes indigestion,"Indigestion is often caused by acid from your stomach irritating your stomach lining or throat. This is called acid reflux.
This can be caused or made worse by:
certain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods
being overweight
smoking
pregnancy
stress and anxiety

Check if you have an infected piercing,"What's normal for a new piercing
For the first few weeks a new piercing might:
be tender, itchy, and the surrounding area may look slightly red on white skin, or a little darker than usual on dark skin
produce a pale fluid that forms a crust
If you've had an ear or nose cartilage piercing, small lumps can sometimes form around the piercing.
The lumps, called granulomas, are trapped fluid. You can treat them by soaking a pad in warm water then holding the pad against them once a day.
Signs of an infection
Your piercing might be infected if:
the area around it is swollen, painful, hot, very red or dark (depending on your skin colour)
there's blood or pus coming out of it – pus can be white, green or yellow
you feel hot or shivery or generally unwell
Credit:"
Treatment for infected piercings,"You may need antibiotics if your piercing is infected. This can be a cream, ointment, or tablets."
How to prevent infections in new piercings,"There are things you can do to reduce the risk of a piercing getting infected.
Do
choose a qualified, experienced and licensed piercer
clean your piercing twice a day
use warm, salty water to soften any crusting
gently turn the jewellery while cleaning the piercing
use a clean paper towel to dry the piercing
gargle with salty water or an alcohol-free mouthwash if you have a mouth piercing
Don’t
do not do your own piercings (you're much more likely to get an infection)
do not use cotton wool to clean the piercing (use a cotton bud or pad)
do not pick at any crusting
do not twist or turn jewellery when the piercing is dry
do not use a towel to dry the piercing
do not have sex until a genital piercing has healed
do not have oral sex until a mouth piercing has healed
do not go swimming for the first 24 hours after a piercing"
Things to ask your piercer,"If you're thinking about getting a piercing, ask the piercer:
to explain what they're going to do
whether there are any risks
how to care for your piercing
how long it will take to heal"
Getting help,"Some people get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It's a good idea to see a GP if you have not conceived after a year of trying.
Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who's already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner.
They can check for common causes of fertility problems and suggest treatments that could help.
Infertility is usually only diagnosed when a couple have not managed to conceive after a year of trying.
There are 2 types of infertility:
primary infertility – where someone who's never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving
secondary infertility – where someone has had 1 or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again
Read more about how infertility is diagnosed."
Treating infertility,"Fertility treatments include:
medical treatment for lack of regular ovulation
surgical procedures such as treatment for endometriosis, repair of the fallopian tubes, or removal of scarring (adhesions) within the womb or abdominal cavity
assisted conception such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF
The treatment offered will depend on what's causing the fertility problems and what's available from your local integrated care board (ICB).
Private treatment is also available, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee it will be successful.
It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask a GP for advice, and should make sure you choose a clinic that's licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).
Some treatments for infertility, such as IVF, can cause complications.
For example:
multiple pregnancy – if more than 1 embryo is placed in the womb as part of IVF treatment there's an increased chance of having twins; this may not seem like a bad thing, but it significantly increases the risk of complications for you and your babies
ectopic pregnancy – the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly increased if you have IVF
Read more about how infertility is treated."
What causes infertility?,"There are many possible causes of infertility, and fertility problems can affect either partner. But in a quarter of cases it is not possible to identify the cause.
Common causes of infertility include:
lack of regular ovulation (the monthly release of an egg)
poor quality semen
blocked or damaged fallopian tubes
endometriosis – a condition where tissue, similar to the lining of the womb (the endometrium), grows in other places outside the womb
Risk factors
There are also several factors that can affect fertility.
These include:
age – fertility declines with age
weight – being overweight or obese (having a BMI of 30 or over) reduces fertility; in women, being overweight or severely underweight can affect ovulation
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – several STIs, including chlamydia, can affect fertility
smoking – can affect fertility: smoking (including passive smoking) affects your chance of conceiving and can reduce semen quality; read more about quitting smoking
alcohol – the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking too much alcohol can also affect the quality of sperm (the chief medical officers for the UK recommend adults should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more)
environmental factors – exposure to certain pesticides, solvents and metals has been shown to affect fertility, particularly in men
stress – can affect your relationship with your partner and cause a loss of sex drive; in severe cases, stress may also affect ovulation and sperm production"
Check if you have ingrown hair,"Credit:
Ingrown hairs can look like raised, itchy bumps on the skin.
On white skin the bumps may look red. Redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin, but they may look a different colour to the surrounding skin.
Sometimes you can see a hair trapped under the skin.
You may be more likely to get ingrown hairs if you have coarse or curly hair.
Credit:
Infected ingrown hairs can be painful. You may see pus in the bumps.
You are more likely to get ingrown hairs in areas you shave, such as:
face and neck
legs

Check if you have insomnia,"You have insomnia if you regularly:
find it hard to go to sleep
wake up several times during the night
lie awake at night
wake up early and cannot go back to sleep
still feel tired after waking up
find it hard to nap during the day even though you're tired
feel tired and irritable during the day
find it difficult to concentrate during the day because you're tired
If you have insomnia for a short time (less than 3 months) it’s called short-term insomnia. Insomnia that lasts 3 months or longer is called long-term insomnia."
How much sleep you need,"Everyone needs different amounts of sleep.
On average:
adults need 7 to 9 hours
children need 9 to 13 hours
toddlers and babies need 12 to 17 hours
You probably do not get enough sleep if you're constantly tired during the day."
What causes insomnia,"The most common causes are:
stress, anxiety or depression
noise
a room that's too hot or cold
uncomfortable beds
alcohol, caffeine or nicotine
recreational drugs like cocaine or ecstasy
jet lag
shift work"
How you can treat insomnia yourself,"Insomnia usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits.
Do
go to bed and wake up at the same time every day
relax at least 1 hour before bed, for example, take a bath or read a book
make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet – use curtains, blinds, an eye mask or ear plugs if needed
exercise regularly during the day
make sure your mattress, pillows and covers are comfortable
Don’t
do not smoke or drink alcohol, tea or coffee at least 6 hours before going to bed
do not eat a big meal late at night
do not exercise at least 4 hours before bed
do not watch television or use devices, like smartphones, right before going to bed, because the bright light makes you more awake
do not nap during the day
do not drive when you feel sleepy
do not sleep in after a bad night's sleep and stick to your regular sleeping hours instead"
How a pharmacist can help with insomnia,"You can buy tablets or liquids (sometimes called sleeping aids) from a pharmacy that may help you sleep better.
Some contain natural ingredients such as valerian or lavender, while others contain an antihistamine.
They cannot cure insomnia but may help you sleep better for 1 to 2 weeks. They should not be taken for any longer.
Some of these products can have side effects, for instance, they may make you drowsy. This could make it difficult for you to do certain things like drive.
Check with your doctor before taking anything for your sleep problems."
Treatment from a GP,"A GP will try to find out what's causing your insomnia so you get the right treatment.
Sometimes you'll be referred to a therapist for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
This can help you change the thoughts and behaviours that keep you from sleeping.
You may be referred to a sleep clinic if you have symptoms of another sleep disorder such as sleep apnoea.
GPs now rarely prescribe sleeping pills to treat insomnia. Sleeping pills can have serious side effects and you can become dependent on them.
Sleeping pills are only prescribed for a few days, or weeks at the most, if:
your insomnia is very bad
other treatments have not worked"
When intensive care is needed,"Intensive care is needed if someone is seriously ill and requires intensive treatment and close monitoring, or if they're having surgery and intensive care can help them recover.
Most people in an ICU have problems with 1 or more organs. For example, they may be unable to breathe on their own.
There are many different conditions and situations that can mean someone needs intensive care.
Some common reasons include:
a serious accident – such as a road accident, a severe head injury, a serious fall or severe burns
a serious short-term condition – such as a heart attack or stroke
a serious infection – such as sepsis or severe pneumonia
major surgery – this can either be a planned part of your recovery, or an emergency measure if there are complications"
What intensive care involves,"Patients on an ICU will be looked after closely by a team of ICU staff and will be connected to equipment by a number of tubes, wires and cables.
There will normally be 1 nurse for every 1 or 2 patients.
This equipment is used to monitor their health and support their bodily functions until they recover.
Equipment that may be used on an ICU includes:
a ventilator – a machine that helps with breathing; a tube is placed in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (tracheostomy)
monitoring equipment – used to measure important bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood
IV lines and pumps – tubes inserted into a vein (intravenously) to provide fluids, nutrition and medication
feeding tubes – tubes placed in the nose, through a small cut made in the tummy or into a vein if a person is unable to eat normally
drains and catheters – drains are tubes used to remove any build-up of blood or fluid from the body; catheters are thin tubes inserted into the bladder to drain pee
Someone in an ICU will often be on painkilling medicine and medicine that makes them drowsy (sedatives).
This is because some of the equipment used can be uncomfortable."
Visiting an ICU,"An ICU can often be an overwhelming place, both for the patient and their loved ones.
It can help to know a little about what to expect.
Visiting hours are usually very flexible, but there may be times when visiting is not advised, so it's a good idea to check before you arrive. The number of people allowed around the person's bed may be limited.
To reduce the risk of spreading infection, you'll be asked to clean your hands when entering and leaving the unit and you may not be able to bring in certain things, such as flowers. Avoid visiting if you're ill.
The person you're visiting may be drowsy and seem confused. They may also appear slightly swollen or have injuries like bruises or wounds. This can be upsetting to see, but staff will ensure they're as comfortable as possible.
A series of tubes, wires and cables will be attached to the patient, which may look alarming at first. Ask staff to explain what these are if you'd like to know.
You may hear alarms and bleeps from the equipment. These help staff monitor their patients.
You'll usually be free to touch, comfort and talk to the person. It may help them to hear and recognise familiar voices, even if they do not appear to respond.
You might want to tell them about your day or read them a book or newspaper.
You can bring in things to make them more comfortable, but ask staff beforehand if there's anything you should not bring.
The ICU staff will be on hand during your visit to answer any questions you have."
Recovering from intensive care,"Once a person no longer needs intensive care, they can be transferred to a different ward to continue their recovery before eventually going home.
Some people may leave the ICU after a few days. Others may need to stay in the ICU for months or may deteriorate there.
Many people who leave an ICU will make a good recovery.
But sometimes there can be lingering problems, such as:
weakness and stiffness
extreme tiredness (fatigue) and a lack of energy
loss of appetite and weight loss
sleep problems
depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
problems with mental abilities – for example, not being able to think clearly and being forgetful
These problems can last several months. Get medical advice if they're a persistent issue for you or a loved one.
Some people may require ongoing support and treatment (rehabilitation) to help them recover."
Making decisions about care,"If your loved one has been admitted to an ICU and is awake and able to communicate, they'll be fully involved in decisions about their care.
But if they're unconscious or sedated, they may not be able to give their consent (permission) for a particular treatment or procedure.
If they knew they were going into intensive care, they may have nominated someone to make decisions about treatment on their behalf (a designated decision maker) or made an advance decision about any treatments they do not want to have.
If this was not possible in an emergency situation, the ICU staff treating them will usually decide what they feel is in their best interests.
They'll talk things over with you and the person's family whenever possible.
Find out more about giving consent to treatment"

Who can use internal condoms,"Most people can use internal condoms.
Almost all internal condoms are made of thin, soft plastic or synthetic rubber.
Some internal condoms are made of latex. It will say on the packet what the condom is made of.
Do not use latex condoms if:
you have a latex allergy
you're using antifungal medicine on or around your anus, vulva and vagina, or penis and testicles"
Using an internal condom,"Do
use a new internal condom every time you have sex
follow the instructions on the condom packet
check the use by date has not expired – an expired condom may not be effective
check the packet for a European CE mark or UKCA mark – this means it’s been tested to high safety standards
Don’t
do not use more than one internal condom, or an internal condom with an external (male) condom – this can make one or both condoms split
do not use oil-based lubricant with internal condoms made of latex – use water-based or silicone-based lubricant instead
How to use an internal condom
You can insert an internal condom up to 8 hours before sex.
Open the packet carefully so you do not damage the condom. Do not use your teeth.
Hold the inner ring and insert the condom into the vagina.
Put a finger into the condom and push it as far into the vagina as you can.
Make sure the outer ring stays outside the vagina.
During sex, make sure the penis goes inside the condom.
After sex, twist the outer ring a few times to prevent semen leaking out when you remove the condom.
Always put used internal condoms in the bin, not the toilet.
Information:
If you choose to use an internal condom for anal sex, you can insert it into the anus using your finger, or by putting it on the penis or a sex toy like an external (male) condom.
Always use lubricant on the outside and inside of the condom."
How well internal condoms work,"How well internal condoms work at preventing pregnancy
Internal condoms are up to 95% effective at preventing pregnancy if you use them correctly every time you have sex.
If not used correctly they’re 79% effective, which means around 1 in 5 women who use internal condoms for a year will get pregnant.
Incorrect use includes:
inserting an internal condom after the penis has touched the vagina
an internal condom splitting or moving out of place during sex
the penis entering the vagina outside the internal condom
How well internal condoms work at preventing sexually transmitted infections
When used correctly for vaginal sex, internal condoms help protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
When used correctly for anal sex, internal condoms may help protect against STIs, but there’s not enough evidence to say how much protection they offer."
Where to get internal condoms,"Contraception services are free and confidential on the NHS.
You can get internal condoms for free from:
some sexual health clinics, also called family planning or contraception clinics
some GP surgeries and pharmacies
some young people's services (call the national sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for more information)
You can also buy internal condoms online or from pharmacies and supermarkets.
Find contraception information and advice services
Getting contraception if you’re under 16
Contraception is free and confidential, including for young people under the age of 16.
The doctor or nurse will not tell anyone, including your parents or carer, unless they think you or someone else is at risk of harm."
Symptoms of intracranial hypertension,"Symptoms of intracranial hypertension (IH) can include:
a constant throbbing headache which may be worse in the morning, or when coughing or straining; it may improve when standing up
temporary loss of vision – your vision may become dark or ""greyed out"" for a few seconds at a time; this can be triggered by coughing, sneezing or bending down
feeling and being sick
feeling sleepy
feeling irritable
finding it difficult or painful to look at bright lights (photophobia)
hearing a pulsing rhythmic noise in your ears (pulsatile tinnitus)
problems with co-ordination and balance
mental confusion
loss of feeling or weakness"
Diagnosing intracranial hypertension,"A GP may suspect you have intracranial hypertension (IH) if you have symptoms of increased pressure on your brain, such as vision problems and headaches.
If a GP thinks you have IH they'll refer you to a hospital specialist.
You may have several different tests to diagnose IH, such as:
an examination to check functions such as your muscle strength, reflexes and balance. Any problems could be a sign of an issue with your brain or nerves
an assessment of your eyes and vision
a CT scan or MRI scan of your brain
a lumbar puncture, where a needle is inserted into your spine to check for high pressure in the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord
Idiopathic IH may be diagnosed if you have increased pressure on your brain and no other cause can be found."
Treatments for idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"Treatments for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IH) can include:
losing weight if you're overweight. This can often help to reduce your symptoms and may sometimes relieve them altogether
stopping any medicine that may be causing your symptoms
medicine to remove excess fluid from the body (diuretics)
medicine to reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid in your brain
a short course of steroid medicine to relieve headaches and reduce the risk of vision loss
Surgery
Surgery may be considered if other treatments do not help, particularly if your vision is getting worse or you're at risk of loss of vision.
The main types of surgery for idiopathic IH are:
shunt surgery – a thin, flexible tube is inserted into the fluid-filled space in your skull or spine to divert excess fluid to another part of your body
optic nerve sheath fenestration – the protective layer surrounding your optic nerve (the nerve connecting the eye to the brain) is opened up to relieve pressure on it and allow fluid to drain away
These procedures can provide relief from your symptoms, but they also carry a risk of potentially serious complications. Talk to the surgeon about what your operation involves and what the risks are."
Risk factors for idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"While the cause, or causes, of idiopathic IH is unknown, a number of risk factors have been linked to the condition.
It's a rare condition that mainly affects women in their 20s and 30s. It most often happens in women who have gained weight. The reason for this is unclear.
Other factors that have been linked with idiopathic IH include:
some hormone conditions such as hypoparathyroidism or Addison’s disease
taking certain medicines including some antibiotics, lithium (for mental health problems) and medicines for thyroid problems
high levels of vitamin A
a lack of red blood cells (iron deficiency anaemia)
lupus – a problem with the immune system"
Complications of idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"Idiopathic IH is not usually life threatening, but it can be a lifelong problem.
It can affect your vision, and there's a risk that you could lose your vision. This is because the increased pressure around the brain can cause swelling of the optic nerve.
Treatment can help with problems with your vision and can reduce the risk of loss of vision.
It's important to tell your doctor straight away if you notice any changes in your vision.
Find out more about living with idiopathic IH from the IIH UK website."
Accessing IUI on the NHS,"See your GP if you are considering having IUI on the NHS.
You may be offered IUI if:
you're unable to have vaginal sex – for example, because of a physical disability or psychosexual problem
you have a condition that means you need specific help to conceive. For example, if 1 of you has HIV and it's not safe to have unprotected sex
you're in a same-sex relationship and have not become pregnant after up to 6 cycles of IUI using donor sperm from a licensed fertility unit (read more about ways to become a parent if you're LGBT+)
Bear in mind that the waiting list for IUI treatment on the NHS can be very long in some areas.
The criteria you must meet to be eligible for IUI can also vary. Check with your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) to find out what the rules are where you live."
Paying for IUI privately,"IUI is also available from some private fertility clinics. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has a fertility clinic finder.
Costs range from about £700 to £1,600 for each cycle of IUI treatment.
The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority (HFEA) website has more information on costs and funding for fertility treatments."
Fertility tests before IUI,"Before IUI is done, you and your partner's fertility will need to be assessed to find out why you are having difficulty conceiving and to see whether IUI is suitable for you.
Read more about diagnosing infertility.
For a woman to have IUI, her fallopian tubes (the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb) must be open and healthy.
You and your partner will not usually be offered IUI if you have:
unexplained infertility
a low sperm count or poor‑quality sperm
mild endometriosis
This is because there is some evidence to suggest that IUI will not increase your chances of getting pregnant in these circumstances, compared with trying to get pregnant naturally."
Timing your IUI treatment,"You may be offered IUI in a natural (unstimulated) cycle or in a stimulated cycle.
To increase your chances of success, a cycle of IUI should be done just after ovulation. Ovulation usually happens 12 to 16 days before your next period. This can vary if you have an irregular menstrual cycle.
You may be given an ovulation prediction kit (OPK) to help you work out the date of ovulation. An OPK device detects hormones released during ovulation in urine or saliva.
Otherwise, blood tests may be used to find out when you are about to ovulate.
Stimulated IUI
Sometimes, fertility medicines are used to stimulate ovulation before IUI. In this case, vaginal ultrasound scans are used to track the development of your eggs. As soon as an egg is mature, you'll be given a hormone injection to stimulate its release."
IUI using a partner's sperm,"If a couple decides to have IUI using their own sperm, the man will be asked to provide a sperm sample at the fertility clinic by masturbating into a specimen cup. This usually happens on the same day that IUI takes place.
The sperm sample will be ""washed"" and filtered to produce a concentrated sample of healthy sperm.
An instrument called a speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina to keep it open. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is then placed inside the vagina and guided into the womb. The sperm sample is then passed through the catheter and into the womb.
This process is mostly painless, although some women experience mild cramping for a short time.
The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes. You should be able to go home after a short rest."
IUI using donor sperm,"Frozen sperm from a donor can also be used for IUI, regardless of whether you are single or in a partnership, gay or straight.
All licensed fertility clinics in the UK are required to screen donor sperm for infections and inherited diseases.
Some infections take a while to show, so the sperm will be frozen for 6 months to allow time for infections, such as HIV, to be detected.
The sperm is frozen whether it's from someone you know, or from a registered and licensed sperm bank.
Choosing to use donated sperm can be a difficult decision, and you should be offered counselling before you go ahead.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has more information about using a sperm donor."
Your chances of success with IUI,"This depends on lots of different things, including:
the cause of infertility
the woman's age
the man's sperm count and sperm quality (using fresh sperm leads to higher conception rates than using frozen sperm)
whether fertility medicines are used to stimulate ovulation (this can increase your chances of success)
There are many different factors involved, so it's best to talk to your fertility team about your individual chances of success."
Are there any risks?,"Some women have mild cramps similar to period pains, but otherwise the risks involved with IUI are minimal.
If you have fertility medicine to stimulate ovulation, there is a small risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Read more about this condition on our page about the risks of IVF. There's also a chance that you will have more than 1 baby, which has additional risks for both you and your babies."
Check if you have irregular periods,"The average gap between periods starting (the menstrual cycle) is 28 days. It can sometimes be a bit shorter or longer.
A woman's periods are irregular if the gap between them is less than 21 days or more than 35 days.
Irregular periods can affect anyone who has periods.
It's more likely for your periods to be irregular when they first start during puberty, and when you're nearing menopause.
Keeping track of your periods
Using an app or a diary to keep track of your periods can help you see if they're irregular.
Day 1 of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period. The last day of your cycle is the day before your next period."
Causes of irregular periods,"Common causes of irregular periods include:
puberty, when you start your periods
the start of menopause (usually between the ages of 45 and 55)
pregnancy – a missed period is often an early sign of pregnancy
hormonal contraception like the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS)
losing or gaining a lot of weight
stress and anxiety
exercising too much
Sometimes, conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and an underactive thyroid gland can cause irregular periods."
Treatments for irregular periods,"Treatment is not always needed for irregular periods.
The GP may refer you to a specialist (gynaecologist) if you need tests to find out what's causing your irregular periods. If treatment is needed it will depend on the cause.
For example, if a condition like polycystic ovary syndrome is causing irregular periods, the combined pill may help make your periods more regular."
Trying for a baby,"Getting pregnant can be more difficult if you have irregular periods because you might not release an egg (ovulate) regularly.
It can help to have sex every 2 or 3 days throughout your cycle without using contraception.
If you're struggling to get pregnant, hormone medicine or fertility treatment may be recommended.
Read more about trying to get pregnant."
Diagnosing IVA,"At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have IVA. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.
If IVA is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment includes a special diet, advice and sometimes medicine.
With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with IVA are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for IVA must be continued for life.
Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop in some children, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated IVA are also at risk of brain damage and developmental delay."
Symptoms of IVA,"The symptoms of IVA aren't the same for everyone with the condition and some people may have more severe or frequent symptoms.
Symptoms sometimes appear within the first few days or weeks after birth and may include:
developing a distinctive odour of ""sweaty feet""
poor feeding or loss of appetite
weight loss
Babies with IVA may also have episodes known as a metabolic crisis. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include:
lack of energy
vomiting
irritability
sleepiness and non-responsiveness
floppiness and falling over
poor feeding
breathing difficulties
It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis.
In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which will help prevent these symptoms developing."
Treating IVA,"Diet
Children diagnosed with IVA are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of leucine your baby receives.
High-protein foods need to be limited, including:
meat
fish
milk and dairy products
eggs
pulses
nuts
Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.
Breast milk and formula milk contain too much leucine for a baby with IVA to break down, so it should be measured and limited as advised by your dietitian. A protein-free baby formula can be given to replace the missing breast or baby milk. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.
People with IVA need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.
Medicine
Your child may be prescribed medicine to help clear some of the excess isovaleric acid. This will be either:
L-carnitine
glycine
Sometimes, both medicines are prescribed to be taken together. Medicine for IVA needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Both of these are taken by mouth.
Emergency treatment
If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill.
Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medicine should still be taken as normal.
Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill.
If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the A&E department. You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen IVA before.
Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein).
You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties."
How IVA is inherited,"The genetic change (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.
A baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father (known as autosomal recessive inheritance). If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of IVA and won't have the condition themselves.
If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:
a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition
a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of IVA
a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes
Although it's not possible to prevent IVA, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.
You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions."
Information about you,"If you or your child has IVA, your clinical team will pass information about you/or them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS on GOV.UK."
How to treat itchy skin yourself,"Sometimes itching is caused by dry, cracked or irritated skin. There are simple things you can do to help ease the itching.
These things may also help stop itchy skin returning and avoid skin damage from scratching.
Do
pat or tap your skin instead of scratching it
hold something cool on your skin, like a damp towel
have cool or lukewarm baths or showers
use an unperfumed moisturiser or emollient regularly
keep your nails clean, short and smooth
wear loose cotton or silk clothing
use a laundry liquid or powder that's for sensitive skin
Don’t
do not wear tight clothes, or clothes made from wool or synthetic fabrics
do not spend a long time in the bath or shower
do not use perfumed soaps, deodorants or moisturisers"
A pharmacist can help with itchy skin,"A pharmacist can tell you what the best products are for itchy skin. For example, medicines called antihistamines may help with some causes of itching.
They can also recommend lotions and creams, such as menthol creams that help by cooling the skin.
Tell the pharmacist where your skin is itchy and if you have any other symptoms.
A pharmacist might also be able to tell you:
what you can do to treat it yourself
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment from a GP,"A GP might prescribe creams, lotions or tablets, depending on what's causing the itching.
They will look at your skin and ask about your symptoms.
They might arrange a blood test, which may help find the cause of your itchy skin.
The GP may also refer you to see a doctor who specialises in skin problems (dermatologist)."
Causes of itchy skin,"Itchy skin has many possible causes. If you have other symptoms (such as a rash or swelling) this might help to find the cause.
But do not try to diagnose yourself. See a GP if you're worried.
Possible causes of itchy skin
Possible causes Common skin conditions
Skin reactions to heat or something you're allergic to
Allergies, hives, heat rash (prickly heat)
Long-term skin conditions
Dandruff, eczema, psoriasis
Fungal skin infections
Thrush, ringworm, athlete's foot
Parasites or insects living on the skin
Scabies, head lice, pubic lice
Itchy skin is common during pregnancy.
It’s usually nothing to worry about but it’s important to check with a GP or midwife because it can sometimes be caused by a liver condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).
Itchy skin is also common after the menopause. It usually gets better over time.
Less commonly, itchy skin can be a sign of a more serious condition, such as thyroid, liver or kidney problems."
Who can have IVF?,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) fertility guidelines make recommendations about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.
These guidelines recommend that IVF should be offered to women under the age of 43 who have been trying to get pregnant through regular unprotected sex for 2 years. Or who have had 12 cycles of artificial insemination, with at least 6 of these cycles using a method called intrauterine insemination (IUI).
However, the final decision about who can have NHS-funded IVF in England is made by local integrated care boards (ICBs), and their criteria may be stricter than those recommended by NICE.
If you're not eligible for NHS treatment, or you decide to pay for IVF, you can have treatment at a private clinic. Costs vary, but 1 cycle of treatment may cost up to £5,000 or more.
Read more about the availability of IVF."
Speaking to your GP about IVF,"If you're having trouble getting pregnant, you should start by speaking to your GP. They can advise on how to improve your chances of having a baby. 
If these measures don't work, your GP can refer you to a fertility specialist for a treatment such as IVF.
Read more about getting started with IVF."
What happens during IVF,"IVF involves 6 main stages:
suppressing your natural cycle – your menstrual cycle is suppressed with medicine
helping your ovaries produce extra eggs – medicine is used to encourage your ovaries to produce more than 1 egg at a time
monitoring your progress and maturing your eggs – an ultrasound scan is carried out to check the development of the eggs, and medicine is used to help them mature
collecting the eggs – a needle is inserted through your vagina and into your ovaries to remove the eggs
fertilising the eggs – the eggs are mixed with the sperm for a few days to allow them to be fertilised
transferring the embryo(s) – 1 or 2 fertilised eggs (embryos) are placed into your womb
Once the embryo(s) has been transferred into your womb, you'll need to wait 2 weeks before taking a pregnancy test to see if the treatment has worked.
Read more about what happens during IVF."
Chances of success,"The success rate of IVF depends on the age of the woman having treatment, as well as the cause of the infertility (if it's known).
Younger women are more likely to have a successful pregnancy. IVF isn't usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because the chances of a successful pregnancy are thought to be too low.
In 2019, the percentage of IVF treatments that resulted in a live birth was:
32% for women under 35
25% for women aged 35 to 37
19% for women aged 38 to 39
11% for women aged 40 to 42
5% for women aged 43 to 44
4% for women aged over 44
These figures are for women using their own eggs and their partner’s sperm, using the per embryo transferred measure.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority (HFEA) has more information about in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including the latest success rates
Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding alcohol, smoking and caffeine during treatment may improve your chances of having a baby with IVF."
Risks of IVF,"IVF doesn't always result in pregnancy, and it can be both physically and emotionally demanding. You should be offered counselling to help you through the process.
There are also a number of health risks involved, including:
side effects from the medicines used during treatment, such as hot flushes and headaches
multiple births (such as twins or triplets) – this can be dangerous for both the mother and the children
an ectopic pregnancy – where the embryo implants in the fallopian tubes, rather than in the womb
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) – where the ovaries overreact to the medicines used during IVF
Read more about support available during and after IVF and the risks of IVF."
Check if you're at risk of Japanese encephalitis,"Japanese encephalitis is not found in the UK. It's mostly found in rural areas of Asia, but it's rare for travellers to get it.
It's caused by a virus which is spread through mosquito bites.
Places where Japanese encephalitis is found include parts of:
India
China
Japan
South Korea
Indonesia
Southeast Asia (such as Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam)"
How to lower your risk of Japanese encephalitis,"There are some things you can do to avoid mosquito bites when travelling to areas with a risk of Japanese encephalitis.
Do
use insect repellent on exposed skin, ideally containing at least 50% DEET
sleep under a mosquito net treated with insecticide
when possible, wear long-sleeved tops, trousers or long skirts, socks and shoes to protect your skin from mosquito bites
get advice from a travel vaccination clinic before you travel
Japanese encephalitis vaccine
A vaccine for Japanese encephalitis is recommended if you're travelling to a part of the world where the virus is found, especially if:
you're staying for more than a month
you're staying in a rural area
you're staying near or visiting rice fields, wetlands, or places where pigs are kept
You'll have to pay for the Japanese encephalitis vaccine. You can get it from travel health clinics and pharmacies with travel health services."
Symptoms of Japanese encephalitis,"Most people who get Japanese encephalitis have no symptoms.
Some people get flu-like symptoms such as:
a headache
a high temperature
feeling or being sick
tummy pain
The symptoms usually go away on their own, but in some people the infection spreads to the brain and causes more serious symptoms such as:
a severe headache
feeling confused
not being able to feel or move parts of your body (paralysis)
seizures (fits)"
Treatment for Japanese encephalitis,"You'll need to be treated in hospital if you're seriously unwell because Japanese encephalitis can be life-threatening.
Treatments for Japanese encephalitis include medicines to help relieve the symptoms, such as painkillers and steroids.
Japanese encephalitis can sometimes cause long-term complications such as paralysis, seizures, and loss of speech."
Symptoms of jaundice,"Your skin may look yellow if you have jaundice.
Credit:
The white part of your eyes may also look yellow.
Credit:
Yellowing of the skin may be less noticeable if you have brown or black skin, but the white part of your eyes will look yellow.
Credit:"
Causes of jaundice,"You may get jaundice if a substance called bilirubin builds up in your body.
There are lots of possible reasons for this and some of them are serious.
They include:
alcohol-related liver disease
gallstones
hepatitis
pancreatitis
sickle cell disease
Treatments for jaundice depend on what's causing it."
Why does my baby have jaundice?,"Jaundice is caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, are broken down.
Jaundice is common in newborn babies because babies have a high number of red blood cells in their blood, which are broken down and replaced frequently.
Also, a newborn baby's liver is not fully developed, so it's less effective at removing the bilirubin from the blood.
By the time a baby is about 2 weeks old, their liver is more effective at processing bilirubin, so jaundice often corrects itself by this age without causing any harm.
In a small number of cases, jaundice can be the sign of an underlying health condition. This is often the case if jaundice develops shortly after birth (within the first 24 hours)."
How common is newborn jaundice?,"Jaundice is one of the most common conditions that can affect newborn babies.
It's estimated 6 out of every 10 babies develop jaundice, including 8 out of 10 babies born prematurely before the 37th week of pregnancy.
But only around 1 in 20 babies has a blood bilirubin level high enough to need treatment.
For reasons that are unclear, breastfeeding increases a baby's risk of developing jaundice, which can often persist for a month or longer. 
But in most cases, the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh any risks associated with jaundice."
Treating newborn jaundice,"Treatment for newborn jaundice is not usually needed because the symptoms normally pass within 10 to 14 days, although they can occasionally last longer.
Treatment is usually only recommended if tests show very high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood.
This is because there's a small risk the bilirubin could pass into the brain and cause brain damage.
There are 2 main treatments that can be carried out in hospital to quickly reduce your baby's bilirubin levels.
These are:
phototherapy – a special type of light shines on the skin, which alters the bilirubin into a form that can be more easily broken down by the liver
an exchange transfusion – where your baby's blood is removed using a thin tube (catheter) placed in their blood vessels and replaced with blood from a matching donor; most babies respond well to treatment and can leave hospital after a few days"
Complications,"If a baby with very high levels of bilirubin is not treated, there's a risk they could develop permanent brain damage. This is known as kernicterus.
Kernicterus is very rare in the UK.
Find out more about kernicterus in babies
You can also read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance about jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days."
Check if you have temporomandibular disorder (TMD),"Symptoms of TMD include:
pain around your jaw, ear and temple
clicking, popping or grinding noises when you move your jaw
a headache around your temples
difficulty opening your mouth fully
your jaw locking when you open your mouth
The pain may be worse when chewing and when you feel stressed.
TMD can also stop you getting a good night's sleep."
How to ease temporomandibular disorder (TMD) yourself,"Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) usually gets better without treatment. But there are things you can do to ease the symptoms.
Do

Treatments for temporomandibular disorder (TMD) from a GP,"The GP may suggest:
stronger painkillers
relaxation techniques to reduce stress
ways to improve your sleep
They might suggest you see:
a dentist, if teeth grinding might be an issue
a psychologist, if stress and anxiety are making your pain worse
a physiotherapist, for advice about jaw exercises and massage
If these treatments do not help, you may be referred to a specialist in joint problems to discuss other options, such as painkilling injections or surgery."

Ways to reduce jet lag,"Jet lag cannot be prevented, but there are things you can do to reduce its effects.
Get plenty of rest before you travel. You could start going to bed and getting up earlier or later than usual (more like the time zone of the place you're travelling to).
During your flight
Do
drink plenty of water
keep active by stretching and regularly walking around the cabin
try to sleep if it's night time at your destination
use an eye mask and earplugs if they help you sleep
Don’t
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they can make jet lag worse
After you arrive
Do
change your sleep schedule to the new time zone as quickly as possible
set an alarm to avoid oversleeping in the morning
go outside during the day – natural light will help your body clock adjust
Don’t
do not sleep during the day – only sleep at night time
Information:
Short trips
If your trip is short (2 to 3 days), you could try not changing your eating and sleeping times to the new time zone, to avoid needing to change your schedule again when you get back."
Treatment for jet lag,"Medicines are not usually needed for jet lag.
Jet lag often improves after a few days as your body clock adjusts to the new time zone.
Sleeping tablets may be helpful if you're having problems sleeping (insomnia). But they can be addictive so should only be used for a short time and if symptoms are severe.
Melatonin is a natural hormone released by the body in the evening to let your brain know it's time to sleep.
Melatonin tablets are not recommended on the NHS for jet lag because there's not enough evidence to show they work."
Symptoms of jet lag,"The main symptoms of jet lag are:
difficulty sleeping at bedtime and waking up in the morning
tiredness and exhaustion
difficulty staying awake during the day
poor sleep quality
concentration and memory problems
Jet lag can also sometimes cause indigestion, feeling sick (nausea), constipation, changes in appetite and mild anxiety."
Symptoms of joint hypermobility syndrome,"You or your child may have joint hypermobility syndrome if you:
often get tired, even after rest
keep getting pain and stiffness in your joints or muscles
keep getting sprains and strains
keep dislocating your joints (they ""pop out"")
have poor balance or co-ordination
have thin, stretchy skin
have bladder or bowel problems
Some people with joint hypermobility syndrome do not have symptoms."
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP will usually test for joint hypermobility syndrome by checking the flexibility of your joints using a test called the Beighton scoring system.
They may also refer you for a blood test or X-ray to help rule out any other conditions, like arthritis."
Treating joint hypermobility syndrome,"There's no cure for joint hypermobility syndrome.
The main treatment is improving muscle strength and fitness so your joints are better protected.
A GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, occupational therapist or podiatrist for specialist advice.
You can also pay for these services privately.
These physical therapies can help to:
reduce pain and the risk of dislocations
improve muscle strength and fitness
improve your posture and balance
Find physiotherapy services
Treating joint pain
Paracetamol and anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen, which comes as tablets, gels and sprays) may help to ease pain.
Speak to a pharmacist about the best painkiller for you.
A GP may be able to prescribe stronger painkillers.
If you're in severe pain, a GP may be able to refer you to a pain clinic to help you cope with pain.
To help ease joint pain and stiffness, you can:
have warm baths
use hot water bottles
use heat-rub cream
Find a pharmacy"
Joint care you can do yourself,"If you have joint hypermobility syndrome, there are things you can do to improve joint and muscle strength and reduce strain.
Do
gentle exercise – start with low-impact exercise like swimming or cycling if you've not been active before (not doing any exercise can make your symptoms worse)
maintain a healthy weight
wear supportive shoes
wear special insoles (orthotics) in your shoes if a podiatrist has recommended them
Don’t
do not overextend your joints just because you can
do not do repetitive exercises or activities – take regular breaks (called pacing)"
What causes joint hypermobility syndrome,"Joint hypermobility syndrome can run in families and it cannot be prevented.
Usually, the joints are loose and stretchy because the ligaments that should make them stronger and support them are weak.
The weakness is because the collagen that strengthens the ligaments is different from other people's.
Most experts agree that joint hypermobility syndrome is part of a spectrum of hypermobility disorders which includes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
Types of joint pain,"Common types of joint pain include:
knee pain
shoulder pain
hip pain
foot pain, including your ankle and toes
hand pain, including your wrist and fingers
elbow pain
neck pain
You might feel pain in 1 joint, or more than 1 joint at the same time, such as your knees and hips."
Causes of joint pain,"There are many possible causes of joint pain. It might be caused by an injury or a longer-lasting problem such as arthritis.
Your symptoms might give you an idea what could be causing the pain. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP if you're worried.
Common causes of joint pain and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain, swelling or bruising after intense or repetitive exercise Sprain or strain
Over the age of 45, pain worse when walking and stiffness after moving Osteoarthritis

take painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, but do not take ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
try to lose weight if you're overweight
Don’t
do not carry anything heavy
do not completely stop moving the affected joint"
Treatments for joint pain,"Treatment for joint pain depends on what's causing it. Sometimes the pain might go away without treatment.
A GP might:
prescribe stronger painkillers
prescribe antibiotics if they think you have an infection
refer you for physiotherapy
refer you to a hospital for a scan or specialist treatment, for example steroid injections or surgery
Information:
Self-refer for treatment

When to see a GP,"See a GP urgently, or call 111 if you can't speak to a GP, if your child has a persistent high temperature and 1 or more symptoms of Kawasaki disease.
If your baby is less than 1 year old, it's even more important to see a GP or call 111 straight away.
The symptoms of Kawasaki disease can be similar to those of other conditions that cause a fever in children.
Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. Children can make a full recovery within 6 to 8 weeks if it's diagnosed and treated promptly, but complications can develop.
It's important to see a GP and start treatment as soon as possible.
Read more about diagnosing Kawasaki disease.
It's not clear exactly what causes Kawasaki disease. It may be due to a combination of factors.
Read more about the possible causes of Kawasaki disease."
Treating Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease is always treated in hospital.
It's best if treatment begins as soon as possible. The sooner treatment starts, the quicker the recovery time and there's less risk of complications developing.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies, and aspirin are the 2 main medicines used to treat Kawasaki disease.
Read more about treating Kawasaki disease."
Complications of Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen, which can lead to complications in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries).
Without treatment, around 1 in 4 children with Kawasaki disease get heart complications. This can be fatal in about 2 to 3% of cases.
Because of this, Kawasaki disease is one of the main causes of acquired heart disease in children under 5 in the UK. Acquired heart disease develops after birth.
Read more about the complications of Kawasaki disease."
Who's affected,"Around 8 in every 100,000 children develop Kawasaki disease in the UK each year.
Research carried out in England from 1998 to 2003 found 72% of children with Kawasaki disease were under the age of 5.
The condition was also shown to be 1.5 times more common in boys than girls."
Support,"The Kawasaki Support Group and Societi, The UK Foundation for Kawasaki Disease can provide you with additional information and advice about your child's condition."
Check if you have a keloid scar,"A keloid scar usually appears a few weeks to years after you damage or injure your skin, such as after a cut, burn or acne.
Keloid scars are usually raised, hard, smooth and shiny. They can be skin colour, pink, red, purple, brown, or darker than the skin around them.
Credit:
You can get keloid scars on any part of the body, but they're most common on the chest, shoulders, chin, neck, lower legs and ears.
Credit:
A keloid scar usually grows for months or years and becomes bigger than the original wound.
While it's growing, it may feel itchy or painful. This usually stops once it's finished growing.
If it's on or near a joint, the joint can be uncomfortable or difficult to move."
Treatment for keloid scars,"You cannot get rid of a keloid scar, but there are treatments that can help improve how it looks and reduce irritation.
Treatments may include:
steroid injections or cream
silicone dressings or gels
cryotherapy (a treatment to freeze the keloid scar)
laser therapy
Surgery to remove the keloid scar is not usually recommended because it's likely to grow back bigger."
Causes of keloid scars,"A keloid scar is when a scar keeps growing and becomes bigger than the original wound.
It can happen if you have too much of a substance called collagen in your skin.
It can happen after any sort of injury or damage to your skin such as a cut, burn, surgery, acne or a body piercing.
You're more likely to get a keloid scar if you:
are of south Asian, Chinese, African Caribbean or Black African origin
are aged 10 to 30 years
are pregnant
have had a keloid scar before"
How to reduce your risk of getting keloid scars,"You cannot prevent keloid scars, but if you are more likely to get them it's recommended to avoid getting tattoos and piercings.
It's also recommended to get early treatment for acne to reduce the risk of scarring."
Check if you have keratosis pilaris,"Symptoms of keratosis pilaris may include:
Dry rough skin.
Credit:
Small, painless bumps on your skin.
Credit:
You usually get patches of small bumps on your arms, thighs or bottom, but they can appear in other places.
The bumps are usually the colour of your skin. They can also be red on white skin or brownish-black on darker skin.
The skin can sometimes feel itchy, and may be better in summer and worse in winter."
Things you can do yourself to help,"Most people with keratosis pilaris have it for years, and it may eventually clear up by itself.
Until it does, there are things you can do to help improve the appearance of your skin.
Do
moisturise your skin – ask a pharmacist what's most suitable for you
use mild and unperfumed soaps and bathing products
gently scrub your skin with a washcloth or exfoliating mitt
have cool or lukewarm showers and baths
pat your skin dry instead of rubbing it after washing
Don’t
do not use perfumed soaps or bathing products that can dry out your skin
do not use harsh scrubs on your skin – this can make it worse
do not have hot baths or showers
do not scratch, pick or rub your skin"
A pharmacist can help with keratosis pilaris,"Speak to a pharmacist if:
things you try yourself are not helping your keratosis pilaris and the condition is bothering you
your skin becomes itchy or inflamed
you're not sure if you need to see a GP
They can recommend creams or lotion to help your skin. They can also tell you whether you need to see a GP."
Specialist treatments,"Specialist treatments for keratosis pilaris include steroid creams and laser treatments.
These types of treatments are not usually available on the NHS and can be expensive to pay for privately. While they may help relieve symptoms in some cases, they do not cure keratosis pilaris, so symptoms can come back after a course of treatment."
Causes,"Keratosis pilaris happens when your hair follicles become blocked with a build-up of keratin, a substance found in skin, hair and nails.
Nobody knows exactly why keratin builds up, but the condition is thought to run in families. So if your parents have it, you may get it, too.
Keratosis pilaris is not infectious, so you cannot spread or catch it."
Symptoms of kidney infection,"Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours.
You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.
In addition to feeling unwell like this, you may also have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) such as cystitis.
These include:
needing to pee suddenly or more often than usual
pain or a burning sensation when peeing
smelly or cloudy pee
blood in your pee"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you feel feverish and have pain that will not go away in your tummy, lower back or genitals.
You should also see a GP if you have symptoms of a UTI that have not improved after a few days, or if you have blood in your pee.
Contact a GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.
If you cannot get a GP appointment and need urgent medical attention, go to your nearest urgent care centre (UCC).
If you do not have a local UCC, go to your nearest A&E."
Diagnosing kidney infection,"To work out if you have a kidney infection, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.
They'll carry out a urine test to see if you have a UTI.
If you're a male with a confirmed UTI, a GP will refer you straight to a specialist (a urologist) for further investigation."
Treatment of kidney infection,"Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream.
You may also need painkillers.
If you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection (for example, if you have a long-term health condition or are pregnant), you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through a drip.
Most people who are diagnosed and treated promptly with antibiotics feel completely better after about 2 weeks.
People who are older or have underlying conditions may take longer to recover."
Causes of kidney infection,"A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria, often a type called E. coli, get into the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra).
The bacteria travel up to your bladder, causing cystitis, and then up into your kidneys.
E. coli bacteria normally live in your bowel, where they cause no harm.
They can be transferred from your bottom to your genitals during sex or if you're not careful when wiping your bottom after going to the loo.
A kidney infection can sometimes develop without a bladder infection. For example, if you have a problem with your kidney, such as kidney stones, or if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system.
Who's at risk
Kidney infections can happen at any age and are much more common in women.
This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.
Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection."
Preventing kidney infection,"The best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria by:
drinking plenty of fluids (plain water is best)
going to the loo as soon as you feel the need to, rather than holding it in
going to the loo after sex
wiping from front to back after going to the loo
washing your genitals every day, and before having sex if possible
treating any constipation – being constipated can increase your chance of developing a UTI
not using a diaphragm or condoms coated in spermicide if you're prone to getting UTIs – it's thought spermicide can increase your risk of getting a UTI
If you keep getting urine infections, a GP may prescribe you a low dose of antibiotics to take regularly.
This may help to prevent the infection returning or any infection spreading to the kidneys."
Symptoms of kidney stones,"You may not notice if you have small kidney stones. You'll usually pee them out without any discomfort.
Larger kidney stones can cause several symptoms, including:
pain in the side of your tummy (abdomen)
severe pain that comes and goes
feeling sick or vomiting
Find out more about the symptoms of kidney stones"
When to get urgent medical help,"You should contact a GP or NHS 111 immediately if:
you're in severe pain
you have a high temperature
you have an episode of shivering or shaking
you have blood in your urine"
What causes kidney stones?,"Waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys.
Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.
This is more likely to happen if you:
do not drink enough fluids
are taking some types of medication
have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine
Find out more about the causes of kidney stones
After a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you pee."
Treating and preventing kidney stones,"Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your pee, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.
Larger stones may need to be broken up or removed with surgery.
Find out more about treating kidney stones
It's estimated up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following 5 years.
To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you do not become dehydrated.
It's very important to keep your urine pale in colour to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones.
Find out more about preventing kidney stones"
The kidneys,"The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs that are roughly 10cm (4 inches) in length.
They're located towards the back of the abdomen on either side of the spine.
The kidneys remove waste products from the blood. The clean blood is then transferred back into the body and the waste products are passed out of the body when you pee."
Who can have a kidney transplant?,"Most people who need a kidney transplant are able to have one, regardless of their age, as long as:
they're well enough to withstand the effects of surgery
the transplant has a relatively good chance of success
the person is able to comply with the recommended treatments required after the transplant – such as taking immunosuppressant medicine and attending regular follow-up appointments
Reasons why it may not be safe or effective to perform a transplant include having an ongoing infection (this will need to be treated first), severe heart disease, cancer that has spread to several places in your body, or AIDS.
You may also need to have an assessment with a psychologist or psychiatrist to make sure that a transplant is right for you."
Kidney donations,"Unlike many other types of organ donation, it's possible to donate a kidney while you're alive because you only need 1 kidney to survive. This is known as a living donation.
People who want to be considered as a kidney donor are carefully tested to ensure they are a suitable donor and are fit for the operation needed to remove a kidney.
Ideally, living donations will come from a close relative because they are more likely to share the same tissue type and blood group as the recipient, which reduces the risk of the body rejecting the kidney.
Kidney donations are also possible from people who have recently died. This is known as deceased kidney donation. However, this type of kidney donation has a slightly lower chance of long-term success.
Find out more about kidney donation on the NHS Blood and Transplant website"
Waiting for a kidney,"People who need a kidney transplant, but do not have a suitable living donor, will have to wait until a suitable deceased donor kidney becomes available.
On average, the waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant is 2 and a half to 3 years. Waiting times are so long because the demand for donated kidneys in the UK is far higher than the available supply of donors.
Kidney donors are particularly required from people of non-white ethnic origin, because rates of kidney disease are especially high in people of South Asian, African and Caribbean ethnic origin. However, there are not as many donors from these communities.
Read more about the kidney transplant waiting list."
The transplant procedure,"If you receive a kidney from a living donor, this will be a carefully planned operation.
If you're waiting for a deceased donor kidney, the transplant centre will contact you when a suitable kidney becomes available. This can happen at any time of the day or night. Staff at the centre will check you do not have any new medical problems and will ask you to go to the centre, where final checks will be performed to be sure the transplant should go ahead.
You'll then have surgery to insert the new kidney and connect it to your blood vessels and bladder. The new kidney will be placed in the lower part of your abdomen (tummy). Your own kidneys will usually be left in place.
A kidney transplant is a major surgical procedure with a wide range of potential risks. In the short term, these risks include blood clots and infection. Longer-term problems, which include diabetes and an increased risk of infections, are usually related to the medicine you need to take to reduce the chance of your body rejecting the kidney.
Because of the risk of further problems, people who have had a kidney transplant require regular check-ups for the rest of their life.
Read more about what happens during a kidney transplant and the risks of a kidney transplant."
Living with a kidney transplant,"Having a healthy lifestyle after a kidney transplant goes a long way to minimise the risk of complications.
Therefore, it's recommended that you:
stop smoking if you smoke
eat a healthy diet
lose weight if you are overweight or obese
take steps to reduce your risk of developing infections
Read more about living with a transplant."
How long do kidney transplants last?,"There are a number of factors which affect how long a transplanted kidney lasts.
These include whether or not the kidney came from a living donor, how well the kidney is matched in terms of blood group and tissue type, and the age and overall health of the person receiving the donation.
If you have a kidney transplant that fails, you can usually be put on the waiting list for another transplant. You may need dialysis in the meantime."
The NHS Organ Donor Register,"In the UK, consent is required before organs can be donated. A person can give their consent to become an organ donor after death by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register or by discussing their wishes with loved ones.
Alternatively, a person's organs can be donated if consent is obtained after their death from an authorised person, such as a relative or friend.
Joining the NHS Organ Donor Register is quick and simple, and will only take a few minutes of your time. You can remove yourself from the register at any time, and you can specify what you're willing to donate."
Symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome does not usually cause any obvious symptoms early in childhood, and even the later symptoms may be difficult to spot.
Many boys and men do not realise they have it.
Possible features, which are not always present, may include:
in babies and toddlers – weak muscles and very flexible (hypermobile) joints, learning to sit up, crawl, walk and talk later than usual, being quieter and more passive than usual, having undescended testicles, only one testicle, or a smaller penis
in childhood – shyness and low self-confidence, problems with reading, writing, spelling and paying attention, mild dyslexia or dyspraxia, low energy levels, and difficulty socialising or expressing feelings
in teenagers – growing taller than expected for the family (with long arms and legs), broad hips, poor muscle tone and slower than usual muscle growth, reduced facial and body hair that starts growing later than usual, small, firm testes, and enlarged breasts (gynaecomastia)
in adulthood – inability to have children naturally (infertility), low sex drive, small, firm testes, and erection problems."
Health issues in Klinefelter syndrome,"Many boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome will not be significantly affected and can live normal, healthy lives.
Infertility tends to be the main problem, although there are treatments that can help.
But men with Klinefelter syndrome are at a slightly increased risk of developing other health problems, including:
type 2 diabetes
weak and fragile bones (osteoporosis)
cardiovascular disease and blood clots
autoimmune disorders (where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body), such as lupus
an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
anxiety, learning difficulties and depression – although intelligence is usually unaffected
male breast cancer – although this is very rare
These problems can usually be treated if they do occur and testosterone replacement therapy may help reduce the risk of some of them."
Causes of Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is caused by an additional X chromosome.
This chromosome carries extra copies of genes, which may interfere with the development of the testicles and mean they produce less testosterone (male sex hormone) than usual.
The extra genetic information may either be carried in every cell in the body or it may only affect some cells (known as mosaic Klinefelter syndrome).
Klinefelter syndrome is not directly inherited – the additional X chromosome occurs as a result of either the mother's egg or the father's sperm having the extra X chromosome (an equal chance of this happening in either), so after conception the chromosome pattern is XXY rather than XY.
This change in the egg or sperm seems to happen randomly. If you have a son with the condition, the chances of this happening again are very small.
The risk of a woman having a son with Klinefelter syndrome may be slightly higher if the mother or father are older."
Testing for Klinefelter syndrome,"See your GP if you have concerns about your son's development or you notice any symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome in yourself or your son.
Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent health problems in the future.
Treatment can help reduce some of the symptoms if necessary.
In many cases, it's only detected if a man with the condition undergoes fertility tests.
Your GP may suspect Klinefelter syndrome after a physical examination and may suggest sending off a sample of blood to check reproductive hormone levels.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by checking a sample of blood for the presence of the extra X chromosome.
Klinefelter syndrome can also be picked up as part of some screening tests during pregnancy."
Treatments for Klinefelter syndrome,"There's no cure for Klinefelter syndrome, but some of the problems associated with the condition can be treated if necessary.
Possible treatments include:
testosterone replacement therapy
speech and language therapy during childhood to help with speech development
educational and behavioural support at school to help with any learning difficulties or behaviour problems
occupational therapy to help with any co-ordination problems associated with dyspraxia
physiotherapy to help build muscle and increase strength
psychological support for any mental health issues
fertility treatment – options include artificial insemination using donor sperm or possibly intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), where sperm removed during a small operation are used to fertilise an egg in a laboratory
breast reduction surgery to remove excess breast tissue
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)
TRT involves taking medicines containing testosterone. It can be taken in the form of gels or tablets in children, or given as gel or injections in adult men.
TRT may be considered once puberty begins and may help with the development of a deep voice, facial and body hair, an increase in muscle mass, reduction in body fat, and improvement in energy. There is also evidence that it can help with learning and behavioural problems.
You should see a specialist in children's hormones (a paediatric endocrinologist) at this time.
Long-term treatment during adulthood may also help with several other problems associated with Klinefelter syndrome – including osteoporosis, low mood, reduced sex drive, low self-esteem and low energy levels – although it cannot reverse infertility.
TRT may be stopped during fertility treatment, or not started until after fertility treatment.
Treatment with TRT will be monitored by your care team as it can cause side effects and health issues.
Lifestyle changes
Leading a healthy lifestyle, including eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, can help reduce your chances of getting conditions like type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease.
It can also help with your mental health, including depression and anxiety.
Try to quit smoking and try to not drink more alcohol than the recommended limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, spread across 3 days."

Check if you have a meniscus tear,"A meniscus tear usually happens when you twist your knee while playing sport. But it can also happen from more minor injuries such as twisting when standing up.
Symptoms of a meniscus tear include:
knee pain or tenderness
stiffness or swelling around your knee – the swelling may not start for a few hours or days
difficulty bending, straightening or moving your knee
your knee giving way when you try to stand
a crunching or clicking feeling when you move your knee
The symptoms can be similar to sprains."
How to ease symptoms of a meniscus tear,"There are some things you can do to ease symptoms of a meniscus tear.
Do
stop any exercise or activities and rest your knee when you can during the first few days
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your knee for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
wrap a bandage around your knee or wear a knee support – remove it when you sleep
keep your leg raised on a pillow as much as possible
take paracetamol to ease pain
Don’t
do not use heat packs and avoid hot baths
do not drink alcohol
do not massage your knee
do not carry anything heavy
do not completely stop moving your knee – after a few days of resting, try to do some gentle movements

Treatments for a meniscus tear,"A meniscus tear can get better on its own without treatment, but it can take a while to heal.
Sometimes, physiotherapy may be recommended to help reduce pain and improve movement and strength in the knee.
If the damage is severe, you may need arthroscopy surgery to repair or remove the damaged cartilage."
ACL injuries,"Knee injuries can occur during sports such as skiing, tennis, squash, football and rugby. ACL injuries are one of the most common types of knee injuries.
You can tear your ACL if your lower leg extends forwards too much. It can also be torn if your knee and lower leg are twisted.
Common causes of an ACL injury include:
landing incorrectly from a jump
stopping suddenly
changing direction suddenly
having a collision, such as during a football tackle
If the ACL is torn, your knee may become very unstable and lose its full range of movement.
This can make it difficult to perform certain movements, such as turning on the spot. Some sports may be impossible to play."
Deciding to have surgery,"The decision to have knee surgery will depend on the extent of damage to your ACL, if there is other knee damage and if your quality of life is affected.
If your knee feels stable and you do not have an active lifestyle, you may decide not to have ACL surgery.
But delaying surgery could cause further damage to your knee, if it gives way or becomes unstable.
Your doctor will discuss options with you and assess if you need surgery, once swelling goes down and if rest and physio has helped to treat your symptoms.
Read more about deciding to have surgery."
Before having surgery,"Before having ACL surgery, you may need to wait for any swelling to go down and for the full range of movement to return to your knee.
You may also need to wait until the muscles at the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and back of your thigh (hamstrings) are as strong as possible.
If you do not have the full range of movement in your knee before having surgery, your recovery will be more difficult.
It's likely to take at least 3 weeks after the injury occurred for the full range of movement to return.
Before having surgery, you may be referred for physiotherapy to help you regain the full range of movement in your knee.
Your physiotherapist may show you some stretches that you can do at home to help keep your leg flexible. They may also recommend low-impact exercise, such as swimming for fitness or cycling. Visit the website of charity Cycling UK for advice.
These types of activities will improve your muscle strength without placing too much weight on your knee. You should avoid any sports or activities that involve twisting, turning or jumping.
Read more about preparing for ACL surgery."
Reconstructive ACL surgery,"A torn ACL cannot be repaired by stitching it back together, but it can be reconstructed by attaching (grafting) new tissue on to it.
The ACL can be reconstructed by removing what remains of the torn ligament and replacing it with a tendon from another area of the leg, such as the hamstring or patellar tendon.
The patellar tendon attaches the bottom of the kneecap (patella) to the top of the shinbone (tibia).
Read more about how ACL reconstructive surgery is performed."
Risks of ACL surgery,"ACL surgery fully restores the functioning of the knee in more than 80% of cases.
But your knee may not be exactly like it was before the injury, and you may still have some pain and swelling.
This may be because of other injuries to the knee, such as tears or injuries to the cartilage, which happened at the same time as or after the ACL injury.
As with all types of surgery, there are some small risks associated with knee surgery, including infection, a blood clot, knee pain, and knee weakness and stiffness.
Read more about the risks of ACL surgery."
Recovering from surgery,"After having reconstructive ACL surgery, a few people may still experience knee pain or instability.
Recovering from surgery usually takes around 6 months, but it could be up to a year before you're able to return to full training for your sport.
Read more about recovering from ACL reconstructive surgery."
The knee,"The 3 bones that meet in the knee are the:
thigh bone (femur)
shin bone (tibia)
kneecap (patella)
These bones are connected by 4 ligaments – 2 collateral ligaments on the sides of the knee and 2 cruciate ligaments inside the knee. 
Ligaments are tough bands of connective tissue. The ligaments in the knee hold the bones together and help keep the knee stable."
How to ease knee pain and swelling,"If you have knee pain, try these things at first:
put as little weight as possible on your knee – for example, avoid standing for a long time
use an ice pack or bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel on your knee for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel or tablets"
Treatments for knee pain,"A doctor can suggest treatment based on what's causing your knee pain.
They might:
prescribe medicine or physiotherapy
refer you to hospital for a scan or specialist treatment (for example, surgery)
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have knee pain, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB

Common causes of knee pain,"Knee pain can be a symptom of many different conditions.
This information might give you an idea of what the cause might be. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Knee pain after an injury
Knee symptoms Possible cause
Pain after overstretching, overusing or twisting, often during exercise
Sprains and strains
Pain between your kneecap and shin, often caused by repetitive running or jumping

Check if it's knock knees,"If you have knock knees, there is a gap between the ankles when you stand with your knees together.
Credit:
You do not have knock knees if there is no gap between the ankles when you stand with your knees together.
Most people will not have any other symptoms.
But sometimes, if your knock knees are severe or caused by another condition, you may have knee or leg pain, or difficulty walking."
Treatment for knock knees,"Knock knees usually gets better as children grow and their legs straighten.
Most children do not need any treatment, but sometimes physiotherapy or treatment from a foot specialist (podiatrist) may be recommended.
Sometimes, if knock knees cause problems such as pain or difficulty walking, you may be referred to a specialist for tests to see what might be causing it.
Rarely, surgery to straighten the knees and legs may be recommended."
Causes of knock knees,"Knock knees in children is a normal part of growth and development, and it usually gets better as they get older.
But in some children and adults it may be caused by something else, such as:
an injury to the knees or legs
osteomyelitis (a bone infection)
arthritis
vitamin D deficiency
some genetic conditions which affect the joints such as joint hypermobility syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes"
What to do if a tooth has been knocked out,"If it's an adult (permanent) tooth:
Hold it by the white bit that sticks out of the gum (the crown). Do not touch the root.
Lick it clean if it's dirty, or quickly rinse it in cold running water for no more than 10 seconds.
Try to put it back into the hole in the gum. If it does not go in easily:
put it in milk
put it in saliva – by spitting into a container (if it's your tooth) or having your child spit into a container (if it's theirs)
hold it in your cheek until you see the dentist – but do not have younger children do this in case they swallow it
If it goes back in, bite down gently on a clean cloth to hold the tooth in place.
Go to a dentist as soon as possible.
If it's a baby tooth:
do not put it back in – it could damage the tooth growing underneath
If you do not know if it's an adult or baby tooth:
put it in milk or saliva (by having your child spit into a container) and bring it to the dentist"
What the dentist will do,"If you put the tooth back in, the dentist will check it's in the right place and move it if they need to.
If you brought the tooth in milk or saliva, they'll clean it and put it back in.
They'll then fix the tooth to the teeth either side of it to hold it in place (splinting).
You'll probably need to go back after a couple of weeks to have the splint removed.
If you cannot find the tooth or the dentist is not able to save it, it can normally be replaced with a false tooth.
You may have to pay for your appointment and treatment.
Read more about NHS dental charges and false teeth and other dental treatments."
What causes kyphosis?,"In kyphosis, the normal curve in the middle section of vertebral column (the thoracic vertebrae) is more curved than normal. There are a number of reasons why this might happen, including:
poor posture (postural kyphosis) – slouching, leaning back in chairs and carrying heavy bags can stretch supporting muscles and ligaments, which can increase spinal curvature
abnormally shaped vertebrae (Scheuermann's kyphosis) – if the vertebrae don't develop properly, they can end up being out of position
abnormal development of the spine in the womb (congenital kyphosis) – if something disrupts the spine's normal development, two or more vertebrae sometimes fuse together
age – as people get older, their spinal curvature can increase
Kyphosis can also develop as a result of a spinal injury.
Read more about the causes of kyphosis."
Treating kyphosis,"If you have kyphosis, your treatment depends on how curved your spine is, whether you have any additional symptoms such as back pain, and the underlying causes.
Children with kyphosis may be able to be treated using non-surgical methods, such as bracing, to limit the progression of kyphosis as they grow. Treatment for mild kyphosis may not be necessary.
Kyphosis rarely requires surgical treatment. It's only needed in some severe cases to correct the curvature of the spine.
Read more about treatment for kyphosis."
Emotional issues,"Older children with kyphosis may become concerned or embarrassed about the effect the condition has on their appearance, or having to wear a back brace.
These concerns can affect different children in different ways. Some children can become socially withdrawn and may be reluctant to take part in activities, such as PE, where their condition may be exposed.
There are no easy answers to these problems, but it can sometimes help to reassure your child that their feelings will improve with time."
Complications,"Complications of kyphosis usually only occur in more severe cases. They include:
persistent pain
breathing difficulties caused by the spine compressing the lungs and airways
Occasionally, people with kyphosis can have difficulties when the nerves running through the spine become compressed or pinched. This can disrupt nerve signals and cause symptoms such as:
numbness or weakness in the arms and legs
problems with sense of balance
loss of normal bladder or bowel control
These serious complications require urgent medical attention and surgery would usually be recommended."
Can kyphosis be prevented?,"Postural kyphosis can be prevented by being aware of your posture and by taking care of your back. You should encourage your child to:
avoid slouching
sit correctly – sit upright, ensuring that all of the back is supported
avoid carrying heavy schoolbags and if using backpacks ensure they are well designed and used properly
take regular exercise to help strengthen the back and keep it flexible; activities such as swimming, running, walking and yoga are ideal for helping to prevent back problems

Causes of labial fusion,"It's not certain what causes labial fusion, but it may happen as a result of irritation or inflammation of the vaginal area, known as vaginitis.
This can cause the inner lips of the vulva to become sticky.
Without enough oestrogen in the body, which is quite normal before puberty, the lips can stay stuck together and gradually become firmly joined.
The problem is rarely seen in girls after they begin puberty because this is when they start to produce the hormone oestrogen.
Labial fusion can also sometimes happen after childbirth or after the menopause, when oestrogen levels are also low."
Seeing a GP,"For most babies or girls, labial fusion does not cause any problems and is often discovered accidentally by a parent or carer during nappy changing or bathing.
The GP can confirm labial fusion after doing a routine examination of the child's genital area."
Treating labial fusion,"A labial fusion or adhesion usually separates naturally without treatment.
Treatment for labial fusion is not recommended unless there are other symptoms, such as dribbling after peeing, which may cause problems or discomfort.
Treatment is with oestrogen cream or ointment applied daily or, very rarely, surgical separation.
Oestrogen creams
A small blob of the cream or ointment is applied daily on to the central line of fusion of the inner lips of the vulva.
This should be continued for up to 6 weeks until the membrane starts to dissolve and the labia eventually separate completely.
You should stop applying the cream when the membrane dissolves.
To enable the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, continue to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream, for a few months after the fusion has separated.
Oestrogen creams and ointments can occasionally cause side effects, especially if used for longer than a few weeks.
Do not apply oestrogen creams and ointments for longer than 6 weeks.
Side effects can include:
tenderness in the chest
temporary darkening of the skin in the genital area - this may be less obvious on brown or black skin
Side effects should go away after the oestrogen cream or ointment is stopped.
Surgery
Surgery is very rarely needed to treat labial fusion. 
It may be considered if:
an oestrogen cream or ointment does not work
there's trapped pee in the vagina, which can dribble out after peeing and cause vulval soreness
Labial fusions are relatively easy to separate during surgery. A doctor can usually gently pull them apart by hand, or by using a small blunt probe.
A surgical separation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic, where you're asleep, or local anaesthetic, where the area is numbed, as the procedure can be quite painful and can cause distress.
To allow the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, it's advised to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream or Vaseline, to the labia for a few weeks afterwards.
There's a high chance the fusion will return after treatment, whether it's with oestrogen cream or surgery."
Complications of labial fusion,"Labial fusion is not linked to any medical condition and has no long-term implications for your child.
It will not affect her future fertility or sexual life. In most cases, a fusion corrects itself during puberty.
In up to 1 in 7 of cases, a fusion may come back, but this tendency usually stops before puberty begins.
Rarely, labial fusion can cause:
infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs)
soreness or pain in the genital area
pee becoming trapped in the vagina, leading to pee leaking between visits to the toilet"
Check if you have labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis,"The most common symptoms of labyrinthitis are:
dizziness or feeling that everything around you is spinning (vertigo)
feeling unsteady and off balance – you might find it difficult to stay upright or walk in a straight line
feeling or being sick
hearing loss
ringing in your ears (tinnitus)
The symptoms of vestibular neuritis are very similar, but it does not cause hearing loss or tinnitus.
Symptoms can start suddenly. They may be there when you wake up and get worse as the day goes on.
The symptoms often ease after a few days.
You'll usually get your balance back over 2 to 6 weeks, although it can take longer."
Things you can do to help,"Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis usually gets better on its own. But there are things you can do to ease the symptoms.
Do
lie still in a dark room if you feel very dizzy
drink plenty of water if you're being sick – it's best to drink little and often
try to avoid noise and bright lights
try to get enough sleep – tiredness can make symptoms worse
start to go for walks outside as soon as possible – it may help to have someone with you to steady you until you become confident
when you're out and about, keep your eyes focused on a fixed object, rather than looking around all the time
Don’t
do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy
do not drink alcohol – it can make symptoms worse"
Treatment from a GP for labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis,"If you have labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis, a GP may prescribe antihistamines or motion sickness tablets for up to 3 days. Do not take them for any longer, as they can slow down your recovery.
Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as a cold or flu, so antibiotics will not help. But a GP may prescribe antibiotics if they think your infection is bacterial.
Exercises for long-term balance problems
Sometimes, balance problems can last for much longer – for many months or even years.
Vestibular rehabilitation is a series of exercises that can help restore balance. You should only do the exercises under the supervision of a specialist such as a physiotherapist or audiologist.
You can ask a GP to refer you to a physiotherapist, or it may be possible to refer yourself directly.
Waiting lists for accessing NHS physiotherapy can be long and you may prefer to pay for private treatment. Most private physiotherapists accept direct self-referrals."
Check if you have lactose intolerance,"Symptoms of lactose intolerance can start a few minutes, or a few hours, after having food or drink containing lactose.
Common symptoms include:
tummy pain or discomfort
bloating
farting
diarrhoea or constipation
feeling sick or being sick
You may also have longer lasting symptoms including a rash (eczema), headaches, joint pain, feeling tired, and finding it hard to concentrate.
Foods that contain lactose
Lactose is found in foods containing animal milk (dairy products), includes milk from cows, goats and sheep.
Dairy products include:
milk
butter
cheese
cream
yoghurt
ice cream
Many processed foods can also contain lactose, including:
cereals
baked foods like bread, crackers, cakes, biscuits, and pastry
sauces and salad dressings
diet and protein shakes"
Tests for lactose intolerance,"If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, you may:
be asked to follow a lactose elimination diet – where you stop eating foods containing lactose to see if your symptoms improve
have blood tests
do a hydrogen breath test – where hydrogen gas in your breath is measured to find out how well you digest lactose
If your symptoms are severe and do not get better, you may need a gastroscopy. This is where a long, thin, flexible tube is passed into your mouth and down into your stomach. A very small sample of cells may be taken from your small intestine so it can be tested.
Before the test, you may be given painkillers to help with any discomfort, and a sedative to help you relax."
Treatment for lactose intolerance,"For most people with lactose intolerance, the symptoms can be prevented by reducing the amount of food you eat that contains lactose, or by avoiding these foods completely.
If you think your child is lactose intolerant, see your GP before removing dairy products from their diet.
Taking a lactase supplement before having food or drink containing lactose may reduce or prevent symptoms for some people.
In some people, lactose intolerance is caused by another health condition, such as coeliac disease. Treating the underlying cause should help."
Causes of lactose intolerance,"The most common cause of lactose intolerance is when the body does not make enough of an enzyme called lactase, which helps you digest lactose.
Lactose intolerance can start at any age and can also be caused by:
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Coeliac disease
bowel infections
bowel surgery
an injury to the bowel
Some premature babies are unable to digest lactose because their bowel has not developed enough, but this usually gets better as your baby gets older.
Some people do not make any lactase at all, but this is very rare."
Symptoms of LEMS,"The symptoms of LEMS develop gradually over weeks or months.
The main symptoms are weakness in the legs, arms, neck and face, as well as problems with automatic body functions, such as controlling blood pressure.
Common symptoms include:
aching muscles
feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)
difficulty walking and climbing stairs
difficulty lifting objects or raising the arms
drooping eyelids, dry eyes and blurred vision
swallowing problems
dizziness upon standing
a dry mouth
constipation
erectile dysfunction
muscle weakness that gets worse with time
See a GP if you have a combination of these symptoms."
Causes of LEMS,"LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves.
Normally, nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles.
If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly.
It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer, but can occur in people without cancer."
Tests for LEMS,"The GP will first check your medical history, ask about your symptoms, carry out a physical examination, and test your reflexes.
If they think you have a problem with your nerves, they may refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for further tests to determine the cause.
Tests you may have include:
blood tests – a blood test can detect substances in the blood (antibodies) resulting from the immune system attacking the nerves
nerve studies – a needle may be inserted into your skin to check how well signals are reaching the muscles from the nerves
scans – you may have a CT scan or PET scan to check for lung cancer
If initial scans do not find cancer, you may be advised to have regular scans every few months for a few years to check that it does not develop later on."
Treatments for LEMS,"There's currently no cure for LEMS, but a number of treatments can help reduce the symptoms.
These include:
treatment for lung cancer – if you have lung cancer, treating it can significantly improve the symptoms of LEMS
medicine to help nerve signals reach the muscles – commonly used medicines include 3,4-diaminopyridine and pyridostigmine
medicine to reduce the activity of the immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used medicines include steroid tablets (such as prednisolone), azathioprine and methotrexate
plasmapheresis – a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves
immunoglobulin therapy – injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves
Medicine is the main treatment, although plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin therapy may be recommended in the short term, or if muscle weakness is severe and other treatments have not helped."
Outlook for LEMS,"Some people respond well to treatment and find that treatment helps keep their symptoms under control.
Others respond less well and find the condition affects their everyday activities and quality of life.
LEMS does not affect life expectancy if it's not associated with cancer. But people with lung cancer and LEMS tend to have a shorter life expectancy because by this point it's very difficult to treat."
Information about you,"If you have LEMS, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
GOV.UK has more information about NCARDRS"
Why a laparoscopy is done,"A laparoscopy can be used to diagnose conditions such as appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis and some cancers, such as liver cancer and ovarian cancer.
It's also used for surgery to treat conditions, such as:
removing organs such as the appendix or gallbladder
repairing hernias or burst or bleeding stomach ulcers
removing organs affected by cancer, such as the ovaries, prostate or liver
treating an ectopic pregnancy
removing the womb (hysterectomy) or fibroids
weight loss surgery
A laparoscopy is often recommended because the recovery time is faster than other types of surgery."
Preparing for a laparoscopy,"The hospital will give you information about how to prepare for a laparoscopy.
Depending on why you're having a laparoscopy, you may be asked to do certain things, such as:
not eating or drinking
stop taking certain medicines, such as anticoagulants
stop smoking
You cannot drive after having a laparoscopy, so you'll need to organise for someone to drive you home."
What happens during a laparoscopy,"If you're having a laparoscopy to diagnose a condition, it usually takes between 30 and 60 minutes. It'll be longer if you're having surgery to treat a condition.
A laparoscopy is done under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation and will not feel any pain.
The surgeon will make a small cut, usually near your belly button.
Air is pumped into your tummy through the cut so the surgeon can see inside your tummy more easily.
A thin, flexible tube with a camera inside (a laparoscope) is then put into the cut so video images of the inside of your tummy can be shown on a screen.
If you're having surgery, more small cuts may need to be made in your tummy for the surgeon to pass their tools through.
When it's finished, the air is let out of your tummy and the cuts are closed with stitches or clips, and a dressing is placed on top.
After the operation
You'll spend some time in the recovery room and have medicine to help with pain and swelling.
After the operation, you may:
feel sick or be sick
feel more tired than normal
have a sore throat
have bloating, cramps or pain and discomfort in your tummy
get shoulder pain
have bruises around your wounds
Most people can leave hospital either on the same day or the day after."
Recovering from a laparoscopy,"How long it takes to recover from a laparoscopy varies.
It usually takes up to 5 days if you had it to diagnose a condition, or up to 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover if you've had surgery.
There are things you can do to help your recovery.
Do
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with any pain
make sure you drink lots of fluids and have a healthy diet
wear compression stockings if you've been given some
move around as much as you can
do foot and leg exercises, such as moving your ankles in circles, while you're resting
keep your wound dry for the first 24 hours – you can shower after this, but make sure the water is not too hot, as it can make the wounds bleed
Don’t
do not have a bath for the first 2 weeks, or until the wound has healed
do not drive for 48 hours or until you can do an emergency stop (but check with your insurer first)
do not fly for 48 hours after having a laparoscopy
do not drink alcohol for 48 hours
do not smoke as it can take your body longer to heal"
Possible complications of a laparoscopy,"A laparoscopy is a common procedure.
Complications are rare, but can include:
needing to have open surgery with a larger cut
a hernia
damage to an organ, such as your bladder
damage to a blood vessel
a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the general anaesthetic
blood clots, such as a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) or pulmonary embolism"
Symptoms of laryngeal cancer,"The main symptom of laryngeal cancer is having a hoarse voice for more than 3 weeks.
Other symptoms include:
a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse
pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing
a lump or swelling in your neck
a long-lasting cough or breathlessness
a persistent sore throat or earache
a high-pitched wheezing noise when you breathe
in severe cases, difficulty breathing
Some people may also experience bad breath, unintentional weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness)."
When to see your GP,"You should see a GP if you have had a hoarse voice for more than 3 weeks.
These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as laryngitis, but it's a good idea to get them checked out.
If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.
Read more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer."
What causes laryngeal cancer,"It's not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:
smoking tobacco
regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol
having family members (such as a parent, brother, sister or child) who have had laryngeal cancer
having an unhealthy diet low in fruit and vegetables
exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust
By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.
Read more about the causes of laryngeal cancer and preventing laryngeal cancer."
How laryngeal cancer is treated,"The main treatments for laryngeal cancer are radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted cancer medicines.
Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it's diagnosed early.
If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.
If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you'll no longer be able to speak or breathe in the usual way.
Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and will need additional treatment and speech and language therapy to help you communicate.
This may include a valve being placed in your throat, or using an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound.
Read more about treating laryngeal cancer and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery."
Outlook,"The outlook for laryngeal cancer depends on the extent of the cancer when it's diagnosed and treated.
Fortunately, most laryngeal cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, which means the outlook is generally better than some other types of cancer.
Overall, about 65 out of every 100 people will live for 5 years or more after diagnosis, and about 55 out of every 100 people will live for 10 years or more.
If you smoke, stopping smoking after being diagnosed with laryngeal cancer may improve your outlook."
Check if you have laryngitis,"Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms."
How you can treat laryngitis yourself,"Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they can cause dehydration"
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis,"Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain"
What happens at the GP appointment,"The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics."
What causes laryngitis,"Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"
Why laser eye surgery and lens surgery are done,"You may have laser eye surgery or lens surgery to:
correct eyesight problems, such as astigmatism, short-sightedness (myopia) or long-sightedness
treat eye conditions that can lead to loss of vision, such as diabetic retinopathy, complications after cataract surgery, age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma
There are several different types of laser eye surgery or lens surgery you might be offered. The type that's suitable for you will depend on factors such as your age and your eye health.
Information:
When you can get laser eye surgery and lens surgery on the NHS
Laser eye surgery and lens surgery are usually only available privately.
You may be able to get laser eye surgery on the NHS if you have:
an eye condition that could lead to loss of vision, including blindness
problems with your sight that cannot be corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses"
What happens during laser eye surgery and lens surgery,"Before having laser eye surgery or lens surgery, you should have a consultation with the surgeon about:
what will happen on the day of your surgery
what aftercare you can expect
what to do if there are complications
You'll usually have the surgery in hospital or at an eye clinic. It usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes.
You'll usually have a local anaesthetic in your eye. This may be eye drops or an injection. For some types of laser surgery, you might need to have a general anaesthetic.
With laser eye surgery the surgeon uses a laser to alter the shape of the outer layer of your eye (cornea). With lens surgery the surgeon will put an artificial lens in your eye.
If you need surgery on both eyes, you'll usually have them both done on the same day. But for some types of lens surgery, it's common to have your eyes done on separate days.
Exactly what will happen will depend on the specific type of laser surgery or lens surgery you're having."
Recovery from laser eye surgery or lens surgery,"After having laser eye surgery or lens surgery, you can usually go home on the same day.
There are some things you can do to help with your recovery.
Do
follow the aftercare advice given to you by your doctor or care team
use lubricant eye drops to keep your eye healthy and ease any discomfort
wear non-prescription sunglasses or goggles for a short while after if advised to
Don’t
do not drive home on the day of your surgery – you'll be advised when you can drive again
do not drive at night until your eyes have recovered"
Side effects of laser eye surgery and lens surgery,"Most people will have some side effects after laser eye surgery or lens surgery.
Common side effects include:
light scatter side effects including glare, halos, floaters, starbursts and ghost images
blurred vision
sore eyes – the symptoms may be similar to dry eyes
red blotches on the white of your eye
These problems will normally improve within a few months.
Contact the hospital or clinic where you had the surgery if you have side effects that do not improve."
Complications of laser eye surgery and lens surgery,"If you have laser eye surgery or lens surgery, there's a chance you could have complications during the operation or afterwards.
The risks vary between different types of surgery. Your surgeon will explain the risks to you before the procedure.
Complications can include:
a detached retina
permanent, serious loss of vision
needing a second operation – for example laser surgery to fine tune your focus, repositioning the new lens, or replacing the new lens with one of a different size
under-treatment or over-correction, where the amount of correction in your vision is either more or less than intended
getting age-related cataracts earlier in life than you might otherwise have done
posterior capsule opacification (PCO) – this is where part of the lens capsule thickens and causes cloudy vision
Some types of lens implant can be removed if they are causing problems. Your vision and eye health will then be the same as it was before you had the implant.
Urgent advice:
Get help from NHS 111 if:
floaters (dots and lines) suddenly appear in your vision or suddenly increase in number
you get flashes of light in your vision
you have a dark ""curtain"" or shadow moving across your vision
your vision gets suddenly blurred
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."

Types of laxatives,"There are 4 main types of laxatives.
Bulk-forming laxatives
Bulk-forming laxatives work by increasing the ""bulk"" or weight of poo, which in turn stimulates your bowel.
They take 2 or 3 days to work.
Bulk-forming laxatives include:
Fybogel (ispaghula husk)
methylcellulose
Osmotic laxatives 
Osmotic laxatives draw water from the rest of the body into your bowel to soften poo and make it easier to pass.
They take 2 or 3 days to work.
They include:
lactulose (also called by the brand names Duphalac and Lactugal)
macrogol (also called by the brand names Movicol, Laxido, CosmoCol, Molaxole and Molative)
polyethylene glycol
Stimulant laxatives
These stimulate the muscles that line your gut, helping them to move poo along to your back passage.
They take 6 to 12 hours to work.
They include:
bisacodyl (also called by the brand name Dulcolax)
senna (also called by the brand name Senokot)
sodium picosulfate
Poo-softener laxatives
This type of laxative works by letting water into poo to soften it and make it easier to pass.
They include:
arachis oil
docusate"
Which laxative should I use?,"It's difficult to know whether a particular laxative will work better than another. It depends on the person.
Unless there's a reason why a type of laxative may be more suitable for you than another:
start with a bulk-forming laxative
if your poo remains hard, try using an osmotic laxative in addition to, or instead of, a bulk-forming laxative
if your poo is soft but is still difficult to pass, try taking a stimulant laxative in addition to a bulk-forming laxative
Speak to a GP or pharmacist if you're unsure which laxative to use.
Also see a GP if you're still constipated after trying all of the different types of laxative, or you think your child might benefit from taking laxatives."
Things to consider,"Laxatives are not suitable for everyone.
They're not usually recommended for:
children (unless advised by a doctor)
people with certain health conditions, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
Before using a laxative, read about it in our Medicines guide or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to make sure it's safe for you to take.
Find out more about the considerations about laxatives"
How to take laxatives,"How you take a laxative depends on the form it comes in.
They're commonly available as:
tablets or capsules you swallow
sachets of powder you mix with water and then drink
a capsule you place inside your bottom (rectum), where it'll dissolve (suppositories)
liquids or gels that you place directly into your bottom
Some laxatives have to be taken at certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning or last thing at night.
Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure how to take your laxative.
If you're taking bulk-forming or osmotic laxatives, it's important to drink plenty of fluids. This is because these laxatives can cause dehydration.
Never take more than the recommended dose of laxatives as this can be harmful and cause side effects."
How long should I take laxatives for?,"Ideally, only take laxatives occasionally and for up to a week at a time.
Stop taking a laxative when your constipation improves.
If your constipation has not improved after taking laxatives for a week, speak to a GP.
After taking a laxative, you can make certain lifestyle changes to help stop getting constipated again, such as:
drinking plenty of water
exercising regularly
including more fibre in your diet
These are better ways of preventing constipation than using laxatives.
Do not take laxatives every day to ease your constipation as this can be harmful.
Speak to a GP if you're still constipated after making lifestyle changes.
In some cases, you may be prescribed a laxative to use regularly, but this should always be supervised by a GP or gastroenterologist (a specialist in gut problems)."
The side effects of laxatives,"Like most medicines, laxatives can cause side effects. They're usually mild and should pass once you stop taking the laxative.
The side effects you may get will depend on the type of laxative you're taking, but common side effects of most laxatives include:
bloating
farting
tummy cramps
feeling sick
dehydration, which can make you feel lightheaded, have headaches and have pee that's a darker colour than normal
Ask a GP for advice if you get any particularly troublesome or persistent side effects while taking laxatives.
Using laxatives too often or for too long can also cause diarrhoea, the bowel becoming blocked by large, dry poo (intestinal obstruction), and unbalanced salts and minerals in your body."
Self-help alternatives to laxatives,"It's often possible to improve constipation without using laxatives.
It may help to:
increase your daily intake of fibre – try to eat about 30g of fibre a day; read about how to increase the fibre in your diet
add bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet – these will help make your poo softer and easier to pass, although bran and fibre can sometimes make bloating worse
drink plenty of water
exercise regularly

What having a learning disability can mean,"A learning disability is different for everyone. Lots of people who have a learning disability can work, have relationships, live alone and get qualifications.
Other people might need more support throughout their life.
Support for people with a learning disability and family carers
Doctors and other health workers might be able to tell if a person has a learning disability when they are very young. But some people get a diagnosis later in their lives. This can be when they are adults.
If you are diagnosed with a learning disability, you might be referred to other health professionals to get the support you need."
What causes a learning disability?,"We do not always know why a person has a learning disability. Sometimes it is because a person's brain development is affected, either before they are born, during their birth or in early childhood.
This can be caused by things such as:
the mother becoming ill in pregnancy
problems during the birth that stop enough oxygen getting to the brain
the unborn baby having some genes passed on from its parents that make having a learning disability more likely
illness, such as meningitis, or injury in early childhood
There are some health conditions where you may be more likely to have a learning disability.
For example, everyone with Down's syndrome has some level of learning disability, and so do many people with cerebral palsy.
Some people with epilepsy also have a learning disability and so do many autistic people."
Profound and multiple learning disability (PMLD),"A profound and multiple learning disability (PMLD) is when a person has a severe learning disability and other disabilities that significantly affect their ability to communicate and be independent.
Someone with a profound and multiple learning disability might have difficulties seeing, hearing, speaking and moving. They may have complicated health and social care needs due to these or other conditions.
People with a profound and multiple learning disability need support to help them with some areas of their life, such as eating, washing or personal care.
Lots of people with a profound and multiple learning disability can still be involved in decisions about themselves, do things they enjoy and be independent.
Some people who struggle with talking might be able to use other ways of communication, like sign language, Signalong, Makaton, or digital systems like picture exchange communication systems (PECS)."
Check if it's leg cramps,"Leg cramps happen when a muscle in the leg tightens and causes a sudden pain that can make it hard to move.
The cramps can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes.
They can affect the:
calf muscle, below the knee at the back of the leg
muscles in the feet or the thighs (less often)
After the cramp has stopped, the muscle might feel sore for up to 24 hours."
Things you can do about leg cramps yourself,"During a cramp
Stretching and massaging the muscle may ease the pain during a cramp, although most cramps go away without you doing anything.
Standing up and putting your weight on the leg with the cramp may also help.
Paracetamol or ibuprofen can help to ease muscle soreness after a cramp, but they will not help when it's happening as they take too long to work.
Preventing cramps
Regular calf-stretching exercises may help to reduce cramps but may not completely stop them from happening.
How to stretch your calf muscles"
Treatment for leg cramps from a GP,"A GP will examine you to try to find out the reason for your leg cramps.
They will suggest a treatment depending on the cause.
This might be:
stretching exercises
quinine tablets if exercise has not helped
Quinine is not suitable for everyone. The GP will discuss potential risks and side effects with you."
Causes of leg cramps,"Leg cramps can sometimes be caused by:
ageing
putting too much strain on muscles during exercise, which can be worse in hot or humid weather
pregnancy (usually in the later stage)
certain medicines – for example, medicine for lowering cholesterol (statins) or high blood pressure (diuretics)
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration)
liver disease because of drinking too much alcohol
The reason for some cramps is unknown."
What causes venous leg ulcers?,"A venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for more than 60% of all cases.
Venous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, if persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has weakened the skin.
Find out more about the causes of venous leg ulcers"
Who's affected,"Venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age.
It's estimated around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one.
You're more at risk of developing one if you previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or find it difficult to walk because of a problem such as:
osteoarthritis
a leg injury
obesity
paralysis
You're also more at risk if you recently had an operation on your leg, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement.
People with swollen and enlarged veins (varicose veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers."
How venous leg ulcers are treated,"Most venous leg ulcers heal within 6 months if they're treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers.
But some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal.
Treatment usually involves:
cleaning and dressing the wound
using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs
Antibiotics may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they do not help ulcers heal.
But unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer coming back after treatment.
Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT or varicose veins.
Find out more about how venous leg ulcers are treated"
Can venous leg ulcers be prevented?,"There are several ways to help prevent developing a venous leg ulcer in people at risk.
These include:
wearing compression stockings
losing weight if you're overweight
exercising regularly
elevating your leg when possible
stopping smoking if you smoke
These measures are particularly important if you previously had a leg ulcer.
This is because you're at increased risk of having another one in the same leg within months or years.
Find out how to prevent venous leg ulcers"
Other types of leg ulcer,"Other common types of leg ulcer include:
arterial leg ulcers – caused by poor blood circulation in the arteries
diabetic leg ulcers – caused by the high blood sugar associated with diabetes
vasculitic leg ulcers – associated with chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
traumatic leg ulcers – caused by injury to the leg
malignant leg ulcers – caused by a tumour of the skin of the leg
Most ulcers caused by artery disease or diabetes occur on the foot rather than the leg."
How you get Legionnaires' disease,"You can get Legionnaires' disease if you breathe in tiny droplets of water containing bacteria that cause the infection.
It's usually caught in places like hotels, hospitals or offices where the bacteria have got into the water supply. It's less common to catch it at home.
You can get Legionnaires' disease from things like:
air conditioning systems
humidifiers
spa pools and hot tubs
taps and showers that are not used often
You cannot usually get it from:
drinking water that contains the bacteria
other people with the infection
places like ponds, lakes and rivers"
Check if you have Legionnaires' disease,"Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include:
a cough
shortness of breath
chest pain or discomfort, particularly when breathing or coughing
a high temperature
flu-like symptoms"
Treatment for Legionnaires' disease,"You may need to go into hospital if you're diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease.
Treatment in hospital may include:
antibiotics given directly into a vein
oxygen through a face mask or tubes in your nose
a machine to help you breathe
When you start to get better you might be able to take antibiotic tablets at home. Antibiotic treatment usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks.
Most people make a full recovery, but it might take a few weeks to feel back to normal."
How you get leptospirosis,"Leptospirosis is spread in the pee of infected animals, most commonly rats, mice, cows, pigs and dogs.
You can get leptospirosis if:
soil or freshwater (such as water from a river, canal or lake) that contains infected pee gets in your mouth, eyes or a cut, usually during activities like kayaking, outdoor swimming or fishing
you touch an infected animal's blood or flesh, usually from working with animals or animal parts
It's very rare to get leptospirosis from pets, other people or bites."
Symptoms of leptospirosis,"Most people who get leptospirosis have no symptoms, or mild flu-like symptoms. But some people get seriously ill.
Symptoms of leptospirosis may include:
high temperature
headache
body aches and pain
tummy ache
feeling sick or being sick
diarrhoea
redness in the white part of your eyes
yellowing of the skin (which may be harder to see on black or brown skin) or white part of the eyes (jaundice)"
Treatment from a GP,"Leptospirosis can often be treated by your GP. You'll usually be given antibiotic tablets to treat the infection. Most people recover in a few days or weeks.
It's important to finish the course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.
Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any aches, pains or a high temperature.
If you have severe symptoms, you may need to be treated in hospital."
How to avoid getting leptospirosis,"Leptospirosis is rare in the UK. You have a higher chance of getting it if you do outdoor activities like water sports (especially while abroad in tropical areas), or you work with animals or animal parts.
There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting leptospirosis.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water after handling animals or animal products
clean any wounds as soon as possible
cover any cuts and grazes with waterproof plasters
wear protective clothing if you're at risk through your job
shower as soon as possible if you've been in potentially infected water
check your dog is vaccinated against leptospirosis (there is no vaccine for people)
Don’t
do not touch water or soil that may contain animal pee
do not touch dead animals with your bare hands
do not drink water from places like rivers, canals or lakes – always boil or treat it first"
Check if you have leukoplakia,"Leukoplakia patches often appear on the tongue.
Credit:
You can also get them on the inside of your cheeks.
Credit:
Some people get patches on their gums.
Credit:
It's also possible to get patches on the floor or roof of your mouth.
The patches:
are not painful
are an irregular shape
are slightly raised
may be slightly red within the patch
cannot be rubbed or scraped away (patches that can be removed could be oral thrush)
There are also a number of other causes of a white tongue."
Mouth cancer risk,"If you have leukoplakia, there's a small risk it could progress to mouth cancer over time.
This is why it's important to see your dentist or GP if you have a white patch in your mouth."
Treatments for leukoplakia,"Treatment for leukoplakia is not always needed, but you'll have regular check-ups to make sure the patch is not getting bigger.
The patch may get smaller or go away if you:
stop smoking
reduce the amount of alcohol you drink
An operation is sometimes needed to remove the patch if there's a risk it could become cancerous.
This may be done while the area is numbed (local anaesthetic) or while you're asleep (general anaesthetic).
The patch can be removed in a number of ways, including using a laser or a surgical scalpel. Your mouth should heal quickly afterwards."
Preventing leukoplakia and mouth cancer,"In the UK, leukoplakia is mostly caused by smoking. But sometimes the exact cause is not known.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting leukoplakia. These may also reduce your chances of getting mouth cancer.
Do
keep your mouth and teeth healthy by taking care of your teeth and gums
have regular dental check-ups
if you wear dentures, make sure they fit properly
eat a balanced diet, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables
Don’t
do not smoke
do not chew tobacco, paan or betel nuts
do not drink more than the recommended amount of alcohol"
Hairy leukoplakia,"Hairy leukoplakia is a type of leukoplakia caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
You may have this type if you have a weakened immune system – for example, you have HIV or have had an organ transplant.
It causes fuzzy white patches, often on the sides of the tongue, that look folded or ridged. They're not painful and cannot be brushed or scraped away.
Antiviral medicines, or treatments applied directly to the patch, may be prescribed to treat hairy leukoplakia.
Unlike other types of leukoplakia, hairy leukoplakia does not carry a risk of mouth cancer."
Check if it's lichen planus,"The main symptoms of lichen planus include:
clusters of shiny, raised, purple-red blotches on your arms, legs or body (you may see fine white lines on the blotches) – the rash may be harder to see on black or brown skin
white patches on your gums, tongue or the insides of your cheeks
burning and stinging in your mouth, especially when you eat or drink
bald patches appearing on your scalp
sore red patches on your vulva
rough, thinning nails with grooves on
ring-shaped purple or white patches on your penis
You may only have 1 of these symptoms.
Lichen planus on your skin can be very itchy, but not always."
Treatments for lichen planus,"Lichen planus on your skin usually gets better on its own in about 9 to 18 months.
Creams and ointments from a GP can help control the rash and ease itching.
If creams and ointments do not work, or you have severe lichen planus, steroid tablets or treatment with a special kind of light (light therapy) can help.
Lichen planus in your mouth can last for several years. Mouthwashes and sprays from a GP can help ease symptoms like burning or sore gums.
You cannot catch lichen planus and it does not usually come back once it's cleared up."
How to ease lichen planus at home,"There are things you can do to help ease lichen planus symptoms at home. These will depend on which area of your body is affected.
Lichen planus on the skin
If you have lichen planus on your skin:
wash with warm water – avoid soaps and body washes
wash your hair over a sink or bath so the shampoo does not touch the rest of your skin
a GP may prescribe a moisturising treatment for the skin (emollient) to use on the rash
try not to scratch your skin
Lichen planus on the genitals
If you have lichen planus on your genitals:
try to have showers rather than baths
hold a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a clean tea towel against the affected areas to ease itching and swelling
avoid wearing tights or close-fitting clothes
carefully dry yourself after having a pee to reduce the chances of pee getting in contact with your skin – avoid rubbing the area
use a lubricant if sex is painful
Lichen planus in the mouth
If you have lichen planus in your mouth:
avoid salty, spicy and acidic foods, or alcohol, if they make your mouth sore
brush your teeth carefully twice a day to keep your gums healthy
use a mouthwash that does not contain alcohol, if it makes your mouth sore"
Check if you have lichen sclerosus,"Lichen sclerosus affects people of all ages, including children. But it's much more common in women over 50.
People with white, brown or black skin can get lichen sclerosus.
It causes patches on the skin that are usually:
itchy
white
smooth or crinkled
easily damaged – they may bleed or hurt if rubbed or scratched
The patches can appear anywhere, but most often are on the:
area around the opening to the vagina (vulva) and anus
foreskin and end of the penis"
Things you can do to help with lichen sclerosus,"To help stop your skin becoming irritated or damaged:
Do
wash with an emollient soap substitute instead of regular soap – ask a doctor or pharmacist about suitable products
gently dab your genitals dry after peeing
regularly apply a barrier cream or ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to affected areas
wear cotton or silk underwear
use vaginal lubricant if sex is uncomfortable
Don’t
do not scratch or rub the affected skin
do not wear tight or restrictive clothes – it may help to wear stockings rather than tights
do not wash your underwear with detergent – just use water
do not do activities like cycling or horse riding until your symptoms have improved"
Treatment for lichen sclerosus,"Lichen sclerosus cannot be cured, but prescription steroid cream usually helps relieve the symptoms.
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine.
You may need to use the cream regularly for a few months to get your symptoms under control.
If your symptoms keep coming back, you may have to keep using it every now and again.
You can get more cream from a GP if you need it."
Problems caused by lichen sclerosus,"Although treatment can help, skin affected by lichen sclerosus can sometimes become scarred and tight over time.
The vulva may shrink, with the clitoris and small inner lips (labia minora) around the opening of the vagina often affected.
The scarring and tightness can cause discomfort when peeing, pooing and during sex. Having an erection can be painful.
If lichen sclerosus is severe, you might need a small operation, such as surgery to widen your vagina or remove your foreskin (circumcision)."
Causes of lichen sclerosus,"The cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown.
It might be caused by your immune system, the body's defence against infection, mistakenly attacking and damaging your skin.
Lichen sclerosus is not:
contagious – you cannot spread it to other people
caused by poor personal hygiene"
Causes of limping in children,"Limping in children is often caused by an obvious injury to the leg or foot, such as:
a sprain or strain
a blister, cut or bruise
a broken bone
Sometimes it may not be clear what's causing your child to limp. The symptoms might give you an idea of what the cause might be.
But do not self-diagnose – a limp with no obvious cause should always be checked by a GP as it could be a sign of something serious.
Other causes of limping in children
Other symptoms Possible cause
Sudden pain in the hip, knee or thigh, sometimes after a viral infection Irritable hip
Pain in the groin, hip or knee, stiff hip, foot or leg turns inward Slipped upper femoral epiphysis
Painful, swollen joints that lasts for longer than 6 weeks Different types of juvenile arthritis
Pain in the groin, thigh or knee after exercise, stiff hip Perthes' disease
A lump on your child's leg, weight loss, pain at night A cancer, such as leukaemia, sarcoma or lymphoma"
Treatment from a GP,"Treatment will depend on what's causing your child to limp. Sometimes it may get better on its own.
A GP will examine your child and may arrange for more tests to find out what's causing your child to limp.
They might:
give you advice on how to treat a sprain or strain at home, such as rest and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen
refer you to hospital for an X-ray or to a specialist (for example, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon) to help find the cause"
Check if you have lipoedema,"Lipoedema is more common in women. It usually affects both sides of the body equally.
Lipoedema can make your bottom, thighs, lower legs and sometimes your arms look out of proportion with the rest of the body.
In early-stage lipoedema, you may have bigger legs, a narrow waist and a much smaller upper body.
Credit:
You may have a large bottom, thighs, and lower legs, but your feet are not usually affected.
Credit:
Sometimes lipoedema can affect the arms too, but the hands are not usually affected.
Credit:
The affected skin feels soft and cool and may be dimpled with an ""orange peel"" texture.
Credit:
You may also have pain, tenderness or heaviness in the affected limbs, and you may bruise easily.
Lipoedema affects people differently.
Some people have mild symptoms that do not affect their life. Others can struggle with physical problems, blaming themselves for the changes in their body, and have mental health problems."
Treatments for lipoedema,"If the GP thinks you have lipoedema they may refer you to a specialist for treatment.
There's currently no cure, but there are things that can help and stop it getting worse.
Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and how they're affecting you.
The main treatments are:
eating healthily, doing more exercise and trying to maintain a healthy weight
wearing compression stockings or bandages to reduce pain and discomfort, and make it easier for you to walk
looking after your skin – for example, by regularly using moisturising cream (emollients) to stop your skin drying out
counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) if you're finding it difficult to cope with your symptoms and you feel depressed
a procedure to get rid of the fat (liposuction) if your symptoms are particularly severe – you may need more than 1 operation and it may not be available on the NHS
Compression therapy
Compression therapy can sometimes help manage lipoedema.
A specially trained clinician will assess you and recommend the most suitable type of compression."
Getting support,"out compression therapy for lipoedema on the LymphConnect website
Getting support
Talking to someone and getting support can help if lipoedema is affecting your quality of life.
Lipoedema UK and Talk Lipoedema give help and advice about managing lipoedema. They can also put you in touch with other people with it."
Causes of lipoedema,"The exact cause of lipoedema is not clear.
It's not caused by being overweight – you can be a healthy weight and still get it.
It may be caused by changes in your hormones:
during puberty
when you're pregnant
when you're going through the menopause
when you're taking the contraceptive pill
Sometimes lipoedema runs in families."
Check if you have a lipoma,"Lipomas are common.
They:
feel soft and squishy
can be anything from the size of a pea to a few centimetres across
may move slightly under your skin if you press them
are not usually painful
grow slowly
can appear anywhere on your body
Lipomas often appear on your shoulders, chest, arms, back, bottom or thighs.
Credit:
You can also get a lipoma in other places, such as your forehead.
Credit:"
Getting a lipoma removed,"Lipomas are harmless and do not usually need to be removed. They would only be removed on the NHS if it was growing or causing symptoms because of where it is.
If you have it removed it may be sent to a laboratory to check it is a lipoma.
You can pay to have a lipoma removed at a private clinic, but it may be expensive.
A GP can give you advice about where to get treatment."
How you get listeriosis,"Listeriosis is usually caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacteria.
Listeria can contaminate a wide range of foods, but most infections are caused by eating chilled, ready-to-eat foods, such as:
cold, cooked sliced meats and cured meats
smoked and cured fish – including in sushi
cooked shellfish
soft mould-ripened cheeses (such as camembert and brie) and blue-veined cheeses
pâté
pre-prepared sandwiches and salads
pre-cut fruit (such as pre-packed melon slices)
unpasteurised milk
dairy products made from unpasteurised milk
Information:
These foods do not always contain listeria. If you have eaten them recently, you do not need to do anything unless you get symptoms of the infection.
Although it's less common, you can also catch listeriosis from:
someone else who has it – for example, if you eat food they've handled when they've not washed their hands
close contact with farm animals – especially sheep and cows that are giving birth"
Symptoms of listeriosis,"In most people, listeriosis has no symptoms or only causes mild symptoms for a few days, such as:
a high temperature
aches and pains
chills
feeling or being sick
diarrhoea
If you're pregnant, you may also have a stomach ache or notice your baby moving less than usual.
Babies with listeriosis may also be irritable and feed less than usual."
Risks of listeriosis,"Listeriosis is not usually serious for most people.
But some people have a higher risk of serious problems, including:
anyone who is pregnant
newborn babies
people with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as cancer, diabetes, liver disease or kidney disease
people having treatment that weakens their immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets
Older people are also at higher risk of getting seriously ill from listeriosis, and this risk increases with age.
If you get listeriosis while you're pregnant, there is a risk it could cause miscarriage or stillbirth.
In babies and people with a weakened immune system, listeriosis can sometimes lead to serious and life-threatening problems such as sepsis or meningitis."
Treatment for listeriosis,"For most people, listeriosis is mild and gets better in a few days.
You can usually look after yourself at home by resting and drinking plenty of fluids.
If you're at a higher risk of getting seriously ill (for example, you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system), you may need antibiotics."
How to avoid listeriosis,"There are some simple things you can do to reduce your risk of getting listeriosis.
Do
keep chilled, ready-to-eat foods cold – try to make sure your fridge is working properly and is set to 5C or below
eat ready-to-eat foods within 4 hours of taking them out of the fridge
eat, cook or freeze foods by their use-by date
follow storage instructions on food labels and use opened food within 2 days (unless the packaging says otherwise)
keep raw and ready-to-eat foods separate
follow any cooking instructions on packaging, and cook or reheat (including frozen vegetables) until they're steaming hot right through
wash your hands regularly with soap and water
Foods to avoid if you're at risk
If you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system, you should avoid eating ready-to-eat cold-smoked or cured fish products, such as smoked salmon or gravlax (unless cooked until steaming hot).
If you're pregnant, you should also avoid eating other foods that have the highest risk of causing listeriosis.
These include:
some soft cheeses (including brie and camembert) – unless cooked until steaming hot
all types of pâté – including vegetable pâté
unpasteurised milk or dairy products
any undercooked food
If you're pregnant, you should also avoid close contact with farm animals that are giving birth or have recently given birth."
Types of liver disease,"There are several types of liver disease, which can have different causes.
Common types of liver disease and the possible causes
Condition Possible causes
Alcohol-related liver disease
Regularly drinking too much alcohol
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Being very overweight (obese) – this may cause fat to build up in the liver
Hepatitis
Catching a viral infection or regularly drinking too much alcohol
Haemochromatosis
A gene that runs in families and may be passed from parents to children
Primary biliary cholangitis
May be caused by a problem with the immune system"
Symptoms of liver disease,"Most types of liver disease do not cause any symptoms in the early stages.
Once you start to get symptoms of liver disease, your liver is already damaged and scarred. This is known as cirrhosis.
Symptoms of cirrhosis include:
feeling very tired and weak all the time
loss of appetite – which may lead to weight loss
loss of sex drive (libido)
yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
itchy skin
feeling or being sick"
Treatment for liver disease,"Treatment for liver disease depends on the type you have and how severe it is.
Healthy lifestyle changes can help with some types of liver disease. For example, alcohol-related liver disease may improve if you stop drinking alcohol.
Some types of liver disease (such as certain types of hepatitis) may need to be treated with medicine.
If you have severe liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis), you may need a liver transplant."
How to prevent liver disease,"The 3 main causes of liver disease are:
obesity
an undiagnosed hepatitis infection
alcohol misuse
You can reduce your risk of many types of liver disease with some simple lifestyle changes such as:
trying to maintain a healthy weight
not drinking too much alcohol
Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. These are recommended if you're at risk.
Important
You do not have to drink an excessive amount of alcohol to risk damaging your health. Regularly drinking just over the recommended levels can be harmful."
More information,"Use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out your body mass index (BMI)

Read about cutting down on alcohol
Find out who should have the hepatitis A vaccine and who should have the hepatitis B vaccine"
What happens,"Having a liver transplant involves 3 main stages:
Having an assessment – to find out if you're suitable for a liver transplant, you'll have several tests and will be asked about your health and lifestyle.
Going on the waiting list – if you're suitable for a transplant, you'll need to wait for a healthy donor liver to become available, which could take several months or more.
Having the operation – when a liver is available, you'll go into hospital for surgery to remove your damaged liver and replace it with the healthy donor one.
This can be a long and difficult process, both physically and emotionally."
Life afterwards,"Liver transplants are generally very successful and most people are eventually able to return to their normal activities afterwards.
It can take a year or more to fully recover.
After a liver transplant, you'll need to:
take medicines to stop your body attacking the new liver (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life
have regular check-ups to see how you're doing and check how well your new liver is working
stay as healthy as possible – including eating healthily and exercising regularly
Most people live more than 10 years after a liver transplant and many live for up to 20 years or more.
Read more about life after a liver transplant"
Risks and complications,"A liver transplant is a big operation that has a risk of some serious complications. These can happen during, soon after, or even years afterwards.
Some of the main complications and risks of a liver transplant are:
your body attacking the new liver (rejection)
the new liver not working properly (graft failure)
a blockage or leak in one of your bile ducts – bile is a liquid produced inside the liver that passes out through small tubes called bile ducts
side effects of the immunosuppressant medicine – such as an increased risk of infections and kidney problems
A liver transplant will only be recommended if the risks of not having a transplant outweigh the risks of having one."
Liver donation,"If you wish to donate your liver, there are 2 ways you can do this:
donate your liver after you die. You do not have to register for organ donation in most parts of the UK. If you do not want to donate after you die, you can register your choice. Read more about registering for organ donation
become a living donor – you have an operation to remove part of your liver and give it to someone who needs a transplant (usually a family member or friend)"
How local anaesthetics work,"Local anaesthetics stop the nerves in a part of your body sending signals to your brain.
You won't be able to feel any pain after having a local anaesthetic, although you may still feel some pressure or movement.
It normally only takes a few minutes to lose feeling in the area where a local anaesthetic is given. 
Full sensation should return when the medicine has worn off a few hours later."
How local anaesthetics are used,"Local anaesthetics are usually given by dentists, surgeons, anaesthetists, GPs and other doctors.
Some medicines containing mild local anaesthetic are also available on prescription or over the counter from pharmacies.
Depending on what they're being used for, local anaesthetics can be given as injections, creams, gels, sprays or ointments.
Some of the main uses of local anaesthetics are outlined on this page.
Treating pain
Slightly painful conditions, such as mouth ulcers and sore throats, can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter gels and sprays that contain a local anaesthetic.
Injections of a local anaesthetic and steroid medicine may be used to treat more severe conditions, such as long-term joint pain. 
Preventing pain during and after surgery
A local anaesthetic, usually given by injection, may be used along with a sedative medicine to keep you relaxed while an operation or procedure is carried out.
Local anaesthetics are mainly used for relatively minor procedures, such as:
a filling or wisdom tooth removal
a minor skin operation, such as the removal of moles, warts and verrucas
some types of eye surgery, such as cataract removal
a biopsy (where a sample of tissue is removed for closer examination under a microscope)
A local anaesthetic may occasionally be used for more major surgery when it's important for you to be awake, such as during certain types of brain surgery, or to prevent pain after a major operation that's been carried out under a general anaesthetic.
Epidural and spinal anaesthetics
An epidural anaesthetic, often referred to as an epidural, is where a local anaesthetic is continually injected through a tube into an area of the lower back called the epidural space.
A spinal anaesthetic is a single injection into a similar space in the back.
Both types of anaesthetic can be used to numb large areas of the body by stopping pain signals travelling along the nerves in the spine.
They're often used during childbirth to ease the pain of labour or if a caesarean section is needed.
They can also be used to reduce the amount of general anaesthesia needed during some operations and can provide pain relief afterwards.
In some types of surgery, such as knee and hip replacements, they can be used in place of a general anaesthetic.
Peripheral nerve blocks
A nerve block is an injection of a local anaesthetic to numb the nerves supplying a particular part of the body, such as the hand, arm or leg.
It may be used so an operation can be carried out without needing a general anaesthetic, or to prevent pain afterwards.
An ultrasound scan is often used to pinpoint the correct nerve.
The injection shouldn't be painful and usually takes about 30 minutes to become fully effective.
When peripheral nerve blocks and epidural or spinal anaesthetics are used in place of general anaesthetics, they're often combined with sedation to make you feel drowsy and more relaxed."
Risks and side effects,"Local anaesthetics are generally very safe and serious problems are rare.
You may have:
some discomfort when the injection is given
a tingling sensation as the medicine wears off
possibly some minor bruising, bleeding or soreness where the injection was given
You shouldn't experience any significant side effects.
You should move carefully until the anaesthetic has worn off as you may not notice if you injure yourself.
Some people experience temporary side effects from a local anaesthetic, such as:
dizziness
headaches
blurred vision
twitching muscles or shivering
continuing numbness, weakness or pins and needles
finding it hard to pee or leaking pee (epidural)
These problems will usually pass, but you should tell the healthcare professional in charge of your care if you experience any.
In very rare cases, you could have an allergic reaction to the local anaesthetic or develop serious problems, such as fits (seizures) or a cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping blood around the body)."
Symptoms of long QT syndrome,"Some people with long QT syndrome do not have any symptoms. They may only become aware of their condition after having an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.
Those who do have symptoms usually have:
blackouts or fainting, because the heart has stopped pumping blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen – the heart's rhythm returns to normal within a few minutes and the person regains consciousness
seizures, which sometimes happen instead of a blackout when the brain is starved of oxygen
heart palpitations, when the heart is beating in a fast or unpredictable way
These symptoms can start unexpectedly and may be triggered by:
stress
a sudden noise – such as an alarm
strenuous exercise – particularly swimming
a slow heart rate during sleep
Risk of death
The heart usually returns to its normal rhythm after it's been beating abnormally.
But if it continues to beat abnormally and is not treated in time with a defibrillator, the heart will stop pumping and the person will die. This is called cardiac arrest, and the heart rarely returns to normal if it is not electrically corrected with shock.
Call 999 for an ambulance if someone with long QT syndrome suddenly collapses and does not regain consciousness. If you're able to, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until medical help arrives.
Long QT syndrome is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy, people. It can also be an underlying cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)."
Causes of long QT syndrome,"Long QT syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene inherited from a parent. The abnormal gene affects the heart's electrical activity.
Certain medicines can also trigger long QT syndrome, including some types of:
antibiotics
antihistamines
antidepressants
antipsychotics
diuretics
heart medicines
But drug-induced long QT syndrome tends to only affect people who already have a tendency to develop the condition.
For more information, see Cardiac Risk in the Young: medicines people with long QT syndrome should avoid."
Diagnosing long QT syndrome,"A GP may recommend you have an ECG and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) if:
you have long QT syndrome
you have blackouts during exercise
you have a family history of unexpected and unexplained sudden death
An ECG records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. If you have long QT syndrome, the trace of the QT section (showing part of the heartbeat) will be longer than normal. Sometimes an exercise ECG will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Genetic testing may be needed to identify the faulty gene causing long QT syndrome. It can also help identify other family members who may have inherited the faulty gene and need clinical assessment."
Treating long QT syndrome ,"Most people with inherited long QT syndrome will need treatment with medicines. Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, may be prescribed to help control irregular heartbeats and slow down your heart rate.
If your symptoms are frequent or severe, and you have a high risk of having a life-threatening arrhythmia, you may need to have a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.
In some cases of long QT syndrome, surgery may be needed to control the flow of chemicals into the heart. This is known as a sympathectomy.
If medicines are causing long QT syndrome, your medicines will be reviewed and an alternative may be prescribed."
Living with long QT syndrome,"With the right treatment, it's possible to avoid long QT syndrome having a major impact on your day-to-day life. However, you may need to make some lifestyle adjustments to reduce your risk of having blackouts.
For example, you may not be able to exercise strenuously or play competitive sports, and may need to try to avoid startling noises, such as alarm clocks. Avoiding stressful situations may also be recommended.
Rehydrating properly after a tummy upset is also essential, usually with supplements containing salt and sugar.
Your doctor may prescribe potassium supplements or suggest increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods in your diet. Good sources of potassium include:
bananas
vegetables
pulses
nuts and seeds
milk
fish
shellfish
beef
chicken
turkey
bread
Always tell medical staff that you have long QT syndrome. Any new medicine, whether prescription or over the counter, will need to be carefully checked to see if it's suitable for you.
For more information you can get a booklet about life with inherited abnormal heart rhythms from the British Heart Foundation."
Check if you have long-sightedness,"Long-sightedness can happen at any age, but often affects people over 40.
Symptoms of long-sightedness include:
finding it hard to see nearby things, for example, words and pictures in books or on screens may look fuzzy
being able to see things more clearly when you move them further away from your eyes
tired eyes after tasks that involve looking at something closely, like reading or working at a computer
headaches"
What happens during an eye test,"To check if you or your child is long-sighted a specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test.
You’ll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. This helps the optometrist find out how well your vision is working.
The optometrist will usually shine a light into your eyes to check the back of your eyes are healthy. They may give you eyedrops which helps them to get a better look."
Treatments for long-sightedness,"Glasses and contact lenses
Long-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses.
These help your eyes focus correctly so you can see nearby objects clearly.
Your optician will give you advice on the best options to treat your long-sightedness. Contact lenses are usually only suitable for adults and may not be suitable for everyone.
Help with the cost of glasses and contact lenses
Laser and lens surgery
Some people with long-sightedness may be able to have laser eye surgery or lens replacement surgery to correct their vision. Both types of surgery are carried out while you are awake, using local anaesthetic, so you will not feel any pain.
Laser eye surgery is where high-energy beams of light (lasers) are used to reshape the surface of the eye (the cornea) to correct the way your eye focuses.
Lens surgery is where the lens inside your eye is replaced with a plastic implant to correct your vision.
Ask your optician if laser or lens surgery may be options for you. These treatments are not usually available on the NHS."
Causes of long-sightedness,"Long-sightedness happens when the eyes cannot focus properly.
This can be because of:
the shape of your eye
the shape of the front layer of your eye (the cornea)
the lens inside your eye has become stiffer, usually due to aging (presbyopia)
Long-sightedness is often passed on from your parents and cannot be prevented.
It can also be caused by other conditions like diabetes and eye cancer, but this is very rare."
Complications of long-sightedness,"If left untreated, long-sightedness may cause other vision problems.
Young children with severe long-sightedness are more likely to develop other eye problems, including lazy eye and squint."
Causes of a low sex drive,"Some of the main causes of a low sex drive include:
relationship problems
stress, anxiety or depression
sexual problems like erectile dysfunction or vaginal dryness
pregnancy and having a baby – your hormone levels change when you're pregnant, and looking after a baby can be stressful and tiring
lower hormone levels as you get older, particularly during the menopause
taking certain medicines, such as medicine for high blood pressure or antidepressants
using hormonal contraception like the pill, patch or implant
drinking too much alcohol
Some long-term conditions can also affect your sex drive, such as heart disease, diabetes, an underactive thyroid or cancer."
Treatments for a low sex drive,"Treatment for a low sex drive depends on what's causing it.
A GP can advise you about help you can get and any treatments that might improve your sex drive.
Possible causes of a low sex drive
Cause Possible treatments
Relationship problems Relationship counselling
Sexual problems like vaginal dryness or erectile dysfunction Medicines to treat the problem, such as vaginal lubricants or medicines to help you get an erection
Menopause Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Mental health problems like depression Antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Medicine, contraception and health conditions Changing to a different medicine or type of contraception, or discussing treatment options if you have a health condition"
Signs of low sperm count,"You could have a low sperm count if you and your partner are having difficulty getting pregnant (conceiving).
You usually find out you have a low sperm count after having tests to check your fertility."
Tests for low sperm count,"The main test to check for low sperm count is a semen analysis test.
This involves a sample of your semen being tested to check the amount of sperm in it. The test also checks how fast the sperm move and the shape of your sperm.
If your semen analysis test results find a possible problem, you'll have another semen analysis test usually around 3 months after the first test.
If the 2nd test also finds a problem with your sperm, you will be referred to a specialist for more tests. This may include blood tests, an ultrasound scan of your testicles or a urine test."
Things you can do if you have a low sperm count,"If you have a low sperm count and you and your partner are trying for a baby, it may still be possible to get pregnant (conceive) naturally.
It's recommended you have sex every 2 to 3 days without using contraception.
There are also some things you can do that may help improve your sperm count.
Do
drink less alcohol – it's recommended to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, spread across 3 days or more
lose weight if you're overweight
stop smoking if you smoke
wear loose fitting underwear – tight underwear can increase the temperature of your testicles which may affect the quality of your sperm
try to avoid exposure to chemicals at work such as pesticides, solvents or some heavy metals
Don’t
do not take recreational drugs such as anabolic steroids or cocaine"
Treatment for low sperm count,"If you have a low sperm count and you and your partner have not been able to get pregnant (conceive) after trying for over 1 year (or 6 months if your partner is 36 or over), there are treatments on the NHS that may help.
Treatment may include in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
These treatments are where eggs are removed from your partner's ovaries and fertilised with your sperm in a lab. They are then put back into your partner's womb to grow and develop.
Other treatment may include using sperm from a donor if your sperm count is very low."
How you get a low white blood cell count,"Common causes of a low white blood cell count include:
cancer treatment, like radiotherapy and chemotherapy
antipsychotic medicines
medicine for an overactive thyroid
some cancers, like leukaemia
infections such as HIV or hepatitis
autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis
Agranulocytosis and neutropenia are conditions that cause a low white blood cell count."
Check if you have a low white blood cell count,"A low white blood cell count does not always cause any symptoms.
The main symptom is getting frequent infections. Signs of an infection may include:
a high temperature
chills and shivering
sore throat
mouth sores that keep coming back
toothache
skin rashes
tiredness
flu-like symptoms
A blood test can tell you if your white blood cell count is low."
Treatment for a low white blood cell count,"Treatment for a low white blood cell count depends on what's causing it. Treatment often includes antibiotics.
If it's caused by a medicine or other treatment you're having, you may need to stop the treatment or change your dose.
You may also need specific treatment:
to boost your white blood cells
if you've got an infection
Occasionally, infections can lead to a life-threatening condition called sepsis."
Things you can do to avoid infections,"If you have a low white blood cell count caused by illness, cancer treatment or medicine, it's important to take steps to avoid infections.
Do
avoid close contact with people who are sick
store and prepare food properly to avoid food poisoning
wash your hands with soap and warm water regularly
use an electric shaver instead of a razor
avoid shared hot tubs
Don’t
do not share food, cups, utensils, toothbrushes or make-up
do not eat raw foods like meat, shellfish and eggs
do not change cat litter or handle animal poo
do not change nappies
do not walk outside barefoot
do not swim in ponds, lakes and rivers"
What happens during lumbar decompression surgery,"If lumbar decompression surgery is recommended, you'll usually have at least 1 of the following procedures:
laminectomy – where a section of bone is removed from 1 of your vertebrae (spinal bones) to relieve pressure on the affected nerve
discectomy – where a section of a damaged disc is removed to relieve pressure on a nerve
spinal fusion – where 2 or more vertebrae are joined together with a section of bone to stabilise and strengthen the spine
In many cases, a combination of these techniques may be used.
Lumbar decompression is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain as it's carried out. The whole operation usually takes at least an hour, but may take much longer, depending on the complexity of the procedure."
Recovering from lumbar decompression surgery,"You'll usually be well enough to leave hospital about 1 to 4 days after having surgery, depending on the complexity of the surgery and your level of mobility before the operation.
Most people are able to walk unassisted within a day of having the operation, although more strenuous activities will need to be avoided for about 6 weeks.
You may be able to return to work after about 4 to 6 weeks, although you may need more time off if your job involves driving for long periods or lifting heavy objects."
Effectiveness of lumbar decompression surgery,"There's good evidence that decompression surgery can be an effective treatment for people with severe pain caused by compressed nerves. 
Many people who have the operation experience a significant improvement in pain. People who found walking difficult before surgery because of leg pain or weakness are often able to walk further and more easily after the operation."
Risks of lumbar decompression surgery,"Although lumbar decompression is often successful, like all types of surgery it carries a risk of complications.
Complications associated with lumbar decompression surgery include:
infection at the site of the operation, or in rare cases an infection elsewhere
a blood clot developing in 1 of your leg veins, known as DVT (deep vein thrombosis); in rare cases, the clot can dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a serious problem called a pulmonary embolism
damage to the spinal nerves or cord – resulting in continuing symptoms, numbness or weakness in 1 or both legs, or in rare cases some degree of paralysis
Surgery tends to be safer if you do not smoke, have good general fitness and lose weight if needed."
The spine and spinal cord,"The spine is made up of 33 segments, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of each other to form the spinal column. In between each vertebra are protective, circular pads of tissue called discs, which cushion the vertebrae during activities such as walking and running.
The spinal canal runs through the centre of the spinal column. It contains and protects the spinal cord and nerves."
Why a lumbar puncture is done,"There are a few different reasons why you might need a lumbar puncture.
A lumbar puncture may be used to:
find out if symptoms you're having are caused by a brain or spine condition
treat a condition, such as an infection or some types of cancer
give you an anaesthetic
You'll usually be referred by a consultant or specialist to have a lumbar puncture. Sometimes it's done if you're very unwell in hospital or need an emergency anaesthetic."
Preparing for a lumbar puncture,"The doctor or specialist should tell you if you need to do anything before your lumbar puncture. You can also ask them about any concerns or questions you have.
For example, you may need to stop taking certain medicines for a short time before the lumbar puncture.
You can also ask if you can bring someone to support you during the procedure, but it may not always be possible."
What happens during a lumbar puncture,"A lumbar puncture is usually done in hospital. It typically takes around 15 to 20 minutes, but can take longer.
Before a lumbar puncture, you’ll need to get undressed behind a screen and put on a hospital gown.
You'll be asked to sit down with your head and shoulders bent forwards, or lie down on your side with your knees pulled up to your chest.
You'll be given a local anaesthetic in your lower back, usually as an injection. This means you'll be awake but will not feel any pain. Children are also usually given medicine (a sedative) to help them relax and stay still.
A needle is slowly inserted into your lower back, between the bones in your spine (vertebrae). You may feel some pressure and discomfort on your back. You may also have a feeling of pins and needles for a few seconds.
If you're having tests or certain treatments, fluid from inside your spine (cerebrospinal fluid) is collected in small tubes. This will be sent to a lab for testing. If you're being given medicines or an anaesthetic, these are injected into your spine.
When the lumbar puncture is finished, the needle is removed. A dressing is put on your back to cover the needle wound and to stop any bleeding.
You'll usually be asked to lie on your side for a lumbar puncture.

During a lumbar pucture, a needle is inserted into the lower back, between the bones of the spine, and into a space that contains cerebrospinal fluid.

Important
A lumbar puncture may feel uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Tell the doctor or specialist if you're in pain.
If you’re worried about needles
Tell the doctor or nurse doing your lumbar puncture if you're worried about needles. They can help you feel more comfortable during the test.
After a lumbar puncture
You’ll need to stay at the hospital for around 1 to 2 hours to be monitored. You'll need to lie flat on your back and rest.
If you’re having a lumbar puncture as an outpatient, you should be able to go home after a few hours."
Recovering from a lumbar puncture,"It can take a few days to recover from a lumbar puncture, and for some people it can take longer. There are some things you can do that can help.
Do
rest for at least 24 hours after having a lumbar puncture
drink plenty of fluids
try lying flat on your back if you have a headache
take paracetamol to ease a headache or any pain
Don’t
do not do physical work, heavy lifting, or play sports until you feel well enough"
Side effects of a lumbar puncture,"After having a lumbar puncture you may have some side effects including:
a headache
back pain
bleeding or clear fluid leaking from where the needle went into your back
swelling where the needle went into your back
These side effects are common and should go away after a few days."
Possible complications of a lumbar puncture,"A lumbar puncture is usually very safe.
Complications are extremely rare, but can include:
long-term back pain
infection
nerve damage, which can cause long-term pain, pins and needles, or loss of feeling in your arms or legs
hearing loss
double vision
blood clots
Sometimes it's difficult to do a lumbar puncture. If this happens, you may need to go back for a second appointment.
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or contact NHS 111 if:
You've had a lumbar puncture and:
you have severe pain
you have a headache that does not go away
you have a high temperature
you're sweating more than usual
your wound is bleeding or leaking clear fluid for more than 1 week
You can also call 111 or get help from NHS 111 online.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 if:
your arms or legs feel weak or numb
you're having problems peeing or pooing
you're feeling confused"
Getting your lumbar puncture results,"If you had a lumbar puncture to find out why you're having certain symptoms, you may get your results in a few days. Sometimes it can take a few weeks.
You may need a follow-up appointment to talk about your results.
If you don't hear anything after a few weeks, contact the specialist or GP surgery.
Your specialist, GP or nurse should talk to you about your results and explain what happens next.
Sometimes you may need other tests, depending on why you had the lumbar puncture.
Ask to talk to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your results, or do not understand them."
Most lumps are normal,"It's common for people to get lumps and growths on their skin. They can be caused by many things.
They can:
be soft or hard to touch
move around
be very small or up to the size of a golf ball
be a lump under the skin or a growth that hangs off your skin"
What happens at your appointment,"The GP will look at your lump. They may be able to tell you what's causing it.
If they're unsure, they might refer you to hospital for tests, such as a biopsy (where a very small sample of the lump is removed and tested) or an ultrasound scan."
Possible causes of lumps,"There are lots of possible causes of lumps and growths.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing it, but do not self-diagnose.
See a GP if you're worried or the lump is still there after 2 weeks.
Lumps anywhere on the body
Lumps on the armpit, neck or groin
Lumps around the bottom
Lump on the breast or testicle
Lump on the hands"
Types of lung cancer,"Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads to the lungs from another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer.
There are two main forms of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts growing. They are:
non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common form, accounting for around 80 to 85 out of 100 cases. It can be one of three types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma.
small-cell lung cancer – a less common form that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer.
The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended."
Who's affected,"Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40. More than 4 out of 10 people diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK are aged 75 and older.
Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the most common cause (accounting for more than 70 out of 100 cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances."
Treating lung cancer,"Treatment depends on the type of mutation the cancer has, how far it's spread and how good your general health is.
If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung may be recommended.
If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health, radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead.
If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually used.
There are also a number of medicines known as targeted therapies. They target a specific change in or around the cancer cells that is helping them to grow. Targeted therapies cannot cure lung cancer but they can slow its spread."
Outlook,"Lung cancer does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until it's spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body. This means the outlook for the condition is not as good as many other types of cancer.
About 2 in 5 people with the condition live for at least 1 year after they're diagnosed, and about 1 in 10 people live at least 10 years.
However, survival rates vary widely, depending on how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis can make a big difference."
Why lung health checks are done," and have ever smoked, you may be offered an NHS lung health check.
Why lung health checks are done
Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer in the UK. There are often no signs or symptoms of lung cancer at an early stage.
The targeted Lung Health Check programme aims to find lung cancer early, sometimes before you have symptoms.
Lung health checks look at how well your lungs are working and can help diagnose lung cancer as early as possible. Early diagnosis can make lung cancer more treatable and make treatment more successful.
Who is eligible for a lung health check
The Government has announced that the NHS will roll out targeted lung screening across England. Currently, lung health checks are only available in some parts of England. They will be available everywhere by 2029.
If you're eligible, you'll get a letter or phone call from your GP or a local NHS service inviting you to an appointment.
You may be invited if all the following apply to you:
you live in an area where lung health checks are currently offered
you're aged between 55 and 74
you're registered with a GP surgery
you're a current or former smoker
Check if lung health checks are available in your area
You can look for lung health checks in your area by visiting the websites below:"
What happens at a lung health check,"Your appointment may be in person, by phone, or online.
A health professional will ask about your health and lifestyle to find out more about your risk of lung cancer.
This includes questions about your breathing, lifestyle, and family and medical history. They will also take your height and weight measurements.
What happens after your lung health check
At the end of the lung health check, 1 of the following things will happen:
No further action – if the lung health check suggests you are not at higher risk of developing lung cancer, then no further action is needed.
Referral to your GP – if the lung health check finds problems with your breathing or lung health, you may be referred to your GP for a follow-up appointment to discuss this in more detail.
Offered a CT scan of your lungs – if the lung health check finds you're at a higher risk of developing lung cancer, you may be invited for a CT scan to take a detailed picture of your lungs. This might be on the same day, or you may be invited to another appointment. The lung health check team will write to your GP with details of your appointment.
Information:
If you are a current smoker, you will be offered advice on how to stop smoking.
Having a CT scan
If you're invited for a CT scan, it may be done in:
a mobile scanning unit in your local community – these can be in lots of different locations, such as in a supermarket car park
your local hospital
Your appointment will last about 30 minutes. The CT scan itself will only take a few minutes and does not hurt.
Getting your CT scan results
You will receive a letter with your results within 4 weeks of the CT scan. This will tell you what happens next.
If the scan shows anything concerning, you may be referred for further lung scans or treatment.
If you have not been invited for a lung health check
The lung health check service is being rolled out across England. They are starting in areas with higher lung cancer rates and new locations are being added regularly.
If you have not been invited for a lung health check but think you should have been, you can contact your local area through the websites above to see if you can be referred.
They may not be available in your area currently. If a service becomes available in your local area, you will receive an invitation.
Information:
If you're not sure the GP knows that you currently smoke, or have smoked in the past, contact the GP surgery and ask them to update your record. This will make sure you are invited for a lung health check in the future.
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
You're worried about symptoms of lung cancer, such as:
a cough that does not go away after 3 weeks
an existing cough that changes or gets worse
chest infections that keep coming back
coughing up blood
being short of breath a lot
unexplained tiredness
an ache or pain when breathing or coughing
loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss
Do not wait for a lung health check if you have any of these symptoms."

When a lung transplant is needed,"A lung transplant will often be recommended if:
a person has advanced lung disease that's not responding to other methods of treatment
a person's life expectancy is thought to be less than 2 to 3 years without a transplant
Conditions that can be treated with a lung transplant include:
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a general term for a number of conditions that damage the lungs, usually as a result of smoking
cystic fibrosis – an inherited condition that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged up with a thick, sticky mucus
pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis – scarring of the lungs"
Types of transplant,"There are 3 main types of lung transplant:
a single lung transplant – where a single damaged lung is removed from the recipient and replaced with a lung from the donor; this is often used to treat pulmonary fibrosis, but it's not suitable for people with cystic fibrosis because infection will spread from the remaining lung to the donated lung
a double lung transplant – where both lungs are removed and replaced with 2 donated lungs; this is usually the main treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis or COPD
a heart-lung transplant – where the heart and both lungs are removed and replaced with a donated heart and lungs; this is often recommended for people with severe pulmonary hypertension
The demand for lung transplants is far greater than the available supply of donated lungs.
This means a transplant will only be carried out if it's thought there's a relatively good chance of it being successful.
For example, a lung transplant would not be recommended for someone with lung cancer because the cancer could come back in the donated lungs.
You also will not be considered for a lung transplant if you smoke."
Living donors,"It's possible for a person to receive a lung transplant from living donors (2 living donors are usually required for 1 recipient).
But lung transplants from living donors are currently rare in the UK.
During this type of lung transplant, the lower lobe of the right lung is removed from 1 donor and the lower lobe of the left lung is removed from the other donor.
Both lungs are removed from the recipient and replaced with the lung implants from the donors in a single operation.
Most people who receive lung transplants from living donors have cystic fibrosis, and their donors are close relatives.
The recipient and donors need to have matching blood groups."
Preparation,"Before being placed on the transplant list you'll need to have some tests to make sure your other major organs, such as your heart, kidneys and liver, will function properly after the transplant.
You may also need to make lifestyle changes, such as giving up smoking and losing weight if you're overweight, so you're as healthy as possible when it's time for the transplant to take place.
Find out more about preparing for a lung transplant"
The lung transplant procedure,"A lung transplant usually takes between 6 and 8 hours to complete, depending on the complexity of the operation.
A cut is made in your chest and the damaged lungs are removed.
Depending on your individual circumstances, you may be connected to a heart and lung bypass machine to keep your blood circulating during the operation.
The donated lungs will then be connected to the relevant airways and blood vessels, and the chest will be closed.
Find out more about how a lung transplant is performed
A lung transplant is a major operation that may take several months to recover from.
It could be quite a while before you're able to return to work, so you'll need to make necessary arrangements with your employer.
Find out more about recovering from a lung transplant"
Risks,"A lung transplant is a complex type of surgery that carries a high risk of complications.
A common complication is the immune system rejecting the donated lungs.
Because of this, a medicine known as an immunosuppressive is given to dampen the effects of the immune system, reducing the risk of rejection.
But taking immunosuppressives carries its own risks as they increase the chances of infection.
Find out more about the risks associated with a lung transplant"
Outlook,"The outlook for people who have had a lung transplant has improved in recent years and it's expected to continue improving.
In 2022, the NHS Blood and Transplant service reported that on average:
83 people out of 100 live for 1 year after a lung transplant
55 people our of 100 live for 5 years after a lung transplant
The NHS Organ Donor Register
All adults in England are considered as organ donors when they die, unless they have opted out, or they are from an excluded group.

Check if you have lupus,"There are lots of possible symptoms of lupus.
The main symptoms include:
joint and muscle pain
extreme tiredness that will not go away no matter how much you rest
rashes that usually come on after being in the sun – the rash is often over the nose and cheeks
You might also have:
headaches
mouth ulcers
a high temperature
hair loss
weight loss
swollen glands, usually in the neck, armpits or groin
depression and anxiety
chest or tummy pain
changes in the colour of your fingers and toes when you're cold, anxious or stressed (Raynaud's)
Symptom flare-ups
Lupus often flares up (relapses) and symptoms become worse for a few weeks, sometimes longer.
Symptoms then settle down (remission). The reason why symptoms flare up or settle down is not known.
Some people do not notice any difference and their symptoms are constant.
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
you often get symptoms of lupus
Lupus is better managed if it's found and treated early."
Tests for lupus,"Lupus is not always easy to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.
A GP will usually do some blood tests. They may diagnose lupus if the tests show you have high levels of a certain type of antibody, and you also have the typical symptoms of lupus.
You might be referred for X-rays and scans of your heart, kidneys and other organs if the doctor thinks they might be affected.
If lupus is confirmed, you'll be advised to have regular checks and tests, such as blood tests to check for anaemia and urine tests to check for kidney problems.
Lupus can range from mild to severe
Severity How it affects the body
Mild
Joint and skin problems, tiredness
Moderate
Inflammation of other parts of the skin and body, including your lungs, heart and kidneys
Severe
Inflammation causing severe damage to the heart, lungs, brain or kidneys, which can be life- threatening"
Treatment for lupus,"Treatment you may have for lupus includes:
anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen
hydroxychloroquine for fatigue and skin and joint problems
steroid tablets, injections and creams for kidney inflammation and rashes
Immunosuppressant or biological medicines are sometimes used to treat severe lupus. They help to calm or control your body's immune system."
Things you can do if you have lupus,"Although medicines are important in controlling lupus, you can help manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of it getting worse.
Do
use high-factor (at least factor 50) sunscreen and wear a hat in the sun – you can get sunscreen on prescription if you have lupus
learn to pace yourself to avoid getting too tired
try to stay active, even on a bad day
try relaxation techniques to manage stress – stress can make symptoms worse
tell your employer about your condition – you might be able to adjust your working pattern
ask for help from family, friends and health professionals
eat a healthy, balanced diet, including vitamin D and calcium
Don’t
do not smoke – smoking makes lupus worse so it's important to stop smoking
do not sit in direct sunlight or spend a lot of time in rooms with fluorescent lights"
Causes of lupus,"Lupus is an autoimmune condition. This means the body's natural defence system (immune system) attacks healthy parts of your body.
It's not contagious.
The causes of lupus are not fully understood. Possible causes include:
viral infection
certain medicines
sunlight
puberty
childbirth
menopause
More women than men get lupus, and it's more common in women with an African, Caribbean, Asian or Chinese background."
Lupus in pregnancy,"Lupus can cause complications in pregnancy.
See a doctor before trying to get pregnant. They can discuss the risks and check if your medicine needs to be changed."
Symptoms of Lyme disease,"A circular or oval shape rash around a tick bite can be an early symptom of Lyme disease in some people.
The rash can appear up to 3 months after being bitten by an infected tick, but usually appears within 1 to 4 weeks. It can last for several weeks.
The rash can have a darker or lighter area in the centre and might gradually spread. It's not usually hot or itchy.
The rash may be flat, or slightly raised, and look pink, red, or purple when it appears on white skin. It can be harder to see the rash on brown and black skin and it may look like a bruise.
The rash may look like a bullseye on a dartboard.
Credit:
Sometimes the edges of the rash may feel slightly raised.
Credit:
Some people also get flu-like symptoms a few days or weeks after they were bitten by an infected tick, such as:
a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery
headache
muscle and joint pain
tiredness and loss of energy"
The chance of getting Lyme disease,"Not all ticks in England carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.
But it's still important to be aware of ticks and to safely remove them as soon as possible, just in case.
Ticks that may cause Lyme disease are found all over the UK, but high-risk places include grassy and wooded areas in southern and northern England and the Scottish Highlands."
How to spot and remove ticks,"Important
Tick bites are not always painful. You may not notice a tick unless you see it on your skin.
Regularly check for ticks on your clothes and skin, and on children and pets after being outdoors.
To remove a tick safely:
Use fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool. You can buy these from some pharmacies, vets and pet shops.
Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible.
Slowly pull upwards, taking care not to squeeze or crush the tick. Dispose of it when you have removed it.
Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water.
The chance of getting ill is low. You do not need to do anything else unless you notice a rash or become unwell.
How to remove a tick safely.
Credit:"
Treatment from a GP,"If a GP thinks you might have Lyme disease, they'll prescribe a course of antibiotics.
The antibiotics you're given will depend on your symptoms, but you may need to take them for up to 28 days. It's important to finish the course, even if you start to feel better.
Some people with severe symptoms will be referred to a specialist in hospital so antibiotics can be given directly into a vein.
Most people with Lyme disease get better after antibiotic treatment. This can take months for some people, but the symptoms should improve over time.
People with symptoms of Lyme disease that last a long time after treatment may be referred to a specialist in hospital for advice and more blood tests.
Important
Some websites offer tests and treatment for Lyme disease that may not be supported by scientific evidence.
Speak to a doctor for advice before buying tests or treatment online."
How to avoid tick bites,"To reduce the chance of being bitten:
cover your skin while walking outdoors and tuck your trousers into your socks
use insect repellent on your clothes and skin – products containing DEET are best
stay on clear paths whenever possible
wear light-coloured clothing so ticks are easier to see and brush off"
Ongoing symptoms of Lyme disease,"A few people who are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease continue to have symptoms, like tiredness, aches and loss of energy, that can last for years.
These symptoms are often compared to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.
It's not clear why this happens to some people and not others. This means there's also no agreed treatment.
Speak to a doctor if your symptoms come back, or do not improve, after treatment with antibiotics.
The doctor may be able to offer you further support if needed, such as:
referral for a care needs assessment
telling your employer, school or higher education institution that you require a gradual return to activities
communicating with children and families' social care"
Symptoms of lymphoedema,"The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body. It can be difficult to fit into clothes, and jewellery and watches can feel tight.
At first, the swelling may be soft and easy to push in, leaving a dent, and may come and go. It may get worse during the day and go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.
Other symptoms in an affected body part can include:
an aching, heavy feeling
difficulty with movement
repeated skin infections
developing hard, tight or thickened skin
folds developing in the skin
wart-like growths developing on the skin
fluid leaking through the skin
Signs of lymphoedema in the head and neck may include swelling or heaviness in the face, mouth or throat, and problems with swallowing and speech."
What causes lymphoedema?,"Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The main functions of the lymphatic system are helping fight infection and draining excess fluid from tissues.
There are 2 main types of lymphoedema:
primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes that affect the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually starts during infancy, adolescence, or early adulthood
secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system; it can be the result of a cancer treatment, an infection, injury, inflammation of the limb, or a lack of limb movement
Read more about the causes of lymphoedema"
Who's affected,"Lymphoedema is thought to affect more than 200,000 people in the UK. Primary lymphoedema is rare and secondary lymphoedema is much more common.
Secondary lymphoedema often affects people with cancers that involve the lymph system or who've had treatment to the lymph nodes, such as breast cancer, vulval cancer, penile cancer, and head and neck cancer.
People who have treatment for skin cancer (melanoma) in the lymph nodes in the groin can also get lymphoedema.
Your treatment team will let you know if you're at risk of getting lymphoedema from your cancer or cancer treatment. Any planned treatment you have will try to avoid causing damage to your lymph nodes.
Cancer Research UK has more information about lymphoedema and cancer."
Diagnosing lymphoedema,"See a GP if you experience the typical symptoms of lymphoedema, such as swelling in your arms and legs. They may refer you to a specialist lymphoedema treatment centre for further assessment.
In many cases, lymphoedema can be diagnosed from your symptoms and medical history, and by examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged.
Occasionally, further tests may be necessary to assess and monitor your condition.
If you're being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you'll be monitored for it afterwards.

Treating lymphoedema,"There's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.
These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.
Read more about treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema."
Complications,"Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema. It can also have a significant psychological impact. It can be serious if it's not treated quickly.
Cellulitis
If you have lymphoedema, the build-up of fluid in your tissues makes you more vulnerable to infection.
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) that often affects people with lymphoedema. Cellulitis can also sometimes cause lymphoedema.
Symptoms of cellulitis can include:
redness and a feeling of heat in the skin – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin
pain and increased swelling in the affected area
a high temperature
chills
Antibiotics taken by mouth (orally) can usually be used to treat cellulitis, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).
Psychological impact
Living with a long-term condition that affects your appearance can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression.
You may be depressed if you've been feeling down for the past few months and no longer find pleasure in things you usually enjoy.
If this is the case, talk to a GP or a member of your lymphoedema treatment team. Effective treatments are available for depression.
Talking to other people with lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety.
Visit the Lymphoedema Support Network website for information and advice. They can also put you in touch with a support group in your area.
If you continue with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable."
Why does it happen?,"We don't know why macular holes develop. The vast majority of cases have no obvious cause. They most often affect people aged 60 to 80 and are more common in women than men.
One possible risk factor is a condition called vitreomacular traction. As you get older, the vitreous jelly in the middle of your eye starts to pull away from the retina and macula at the back of the eye. If some of the vitreous jelly remains attached, it can lead to a macular hole.
A few cases may be associated with:
retinal detachment – when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients
severe injury to the eye
being slightly long-sighted (hyperopic)
being very short-sighted (myopic)
persistent swelling of the central retina (cystoid macular oedema)"
What should I do?,"If you have blurred or distorted vision, or there's a black spot in the centre of your vision, see your GP or optician as soon as possible. You'll probably be referred to a specialist in eye conditions (ophthalmologist).
If you do have a macular hole and you don't seek help, your central vision will probably get gradually worse.
Relatively early treatment (within months) may give a better outcome in terms of improvement in vision.
Sometimes the hole may close and heal by itself, so your ophthalmologist may want to monitor it before recommending treatment."
What is the treatment and how successful is it?,"Vitrectomy surgery
A macular hole can often be repaired using an operation called a vitrectomy.
The operation is successful in closing the hole in around 9 out of 10 people who've had the hole for less than 6 months. If the hole has been present for a year or longer, the success rate will be lower.
Even if surgery does not close the hole, your vision will usually at least become stable, and you may find you have less vision distortion.
In a minority of patients, the hole does not close despite surgery, and the central vision can continue to deteriorate. However, a second operation can still be successful in closing the hole.
Ocriplasmin injection
If a macular hole is caused by vitreomacular traction, it may be possible to treat it with an injection of ocriplasmin, also called Jetrea, into the eye. The injection helps the vitreous jelly inside your eye to separate from the back of the eye and allows the macular hole to close.
The injection takes a few seconds and you'll be given local anaesthetic, as eye drops or an injection, so you won't feel any pain. You'll also be given eye drops to dilate your pupil so the ophthalmologist can see the back of your eye.
An ocriplasmin injection is usually only available in the early stages – while the macular hole is less than 400 micrometres wide – but causing severe symptoms.
Ocriplasmin can cause some mild side effects, which usually go away, such as:
temporary discomfort, redness, dryness or itching
swelling of your eye or eyelid
sensitivity to light
flashing lights
blurred, distorted vision
decrease in vision or blind spots
A small number of people may develop more severe side effects, such as a noticeable loss of vision, enlargement of the macular hole or retinal detachment. Surgery is usually needed to correct macular hole enlargement or retinal detachment.
Seek help immediately if you have:
severely decreased or distorted vision
severe eye pain
double vision, headaches, or you are feeling or being sick
Your vision may be blurry immediately after the injection. You should not drive or use any tools or machines until it's back to normal.
If the ocriplasmin injection fails to close the macular hole, vitrectomy surgery may be suggested to close the macular hole and improve the vision."
What does vitrectomy surgery involve?,"Macular hole surgery is a form of keyhole surgery performed under a microscope.
Small incisions are made in the white of the eye and very fine instruments are inserted.
First, the vitreous jelly is removed (vitrectomy) and then a very delicate layer (the inner limiting membrane) is carefully peeled off the surface of the retina around the hole to release the forces that keep the hole open.
The eye is then filled with a temporary gas bubble, which presses the hole flat onto the back of the eye to help it seal.
The bubble of gas will block the vision while it's present, but it slowly disappears over a period of about 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the type of gas used.
Macular hole surgery usually lasts about an hour and can be done while you're awake (under local anaesthetic) or asleep (under general anaesthetic). 
Most patients opt for a local anaesthetic, which involves a numbing injection around the eye, so no pain is felt during the operation."
What can I expect after the operation?,"Temporary poor vision
With the gas in place, the vision in your eye will be very poor – a bit like having your eye open under water.
Your balance may be affected and you'll have trouble judging distances, so be aware of steps and kerbs. You may have problems with activities such as pouring liquids or picking up objects.
In the 7 to 10 days after the operation, the gas bubble slowly starts to shrink. As this happens, the space that was taken up by the gas fills with the natural fluid made by your eye, and your vision should start to improve.
It generally takes 6 to 8 weeks for the gas to be absorbed and vision to improve.
Mild pain or discomfort
Your eye may be mildly sore after the operation and will probably feel sensitive.
Contact your ophthalmologist immediately or go to your nearest eye A&E department if at any time:
you're in severe pain
your vision gets worse than it was on the day after the surgery
Protective dressing
When you wake up, your eye will be padded with a protective plastic shield taped over it. The pad and shield can be removed the day after the operation.
Going home
You may be able to go home the same day, but most patients need to stay in hospital overnight.
If you've had a general anaesthetic, you will not be able to leave the hospital unless a responsible adult is there to help you get home.
Medication
You'll usually be prescribed 2 or 3 types of eye drops to take after surgery:
an antibiotic
a steroid
a drug to control the pressure in your eye
You'll be seen again in the clinic about 2 weeks after the operation and, if all is well, the drops will be reduced over the following weeks.
Caring for your eye at home
For the first few weeks after you return home, you may need to avoid:
rubbing your eye – you may be asked to wear an eyepatch
swimming – to avoid infection from the water
strenuous exercise
wearing eye make-up"
Do I need to position myself face down after the operation?,"Once at home, you may have to spend several hours during the day with your head held still and in a specific position, called posturing.
The aim of lying or sitting face down is to keep the gas bubble in contact with the hole as much as possible, to encourage it to close.
There's evidence that lying face down improves the success rate for larger holes, but it may not be needed for smaller holes.
If you're asked to do some face-down posturing, your head should be positioned so the tip of your nose points straight down to the ground. This could be done sitting at a table, or lying flat on your stomach on a bed or sofa. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need to do this and, if so, for how long.
If face-down posturing isn't advised, you may simply be told to avoid lying on your back for at least 2 weeks after the surgery.
Sleeping
You may be advised to avoid sleeping on your back following surgery, to make sure the gas bubble is in contact with the macular hole as much as possible.
Your ophthalmologist will advise you whether you need to sleep like this and for how long."
Am I able to travel after macular hole surgery?,"You must not fly or travel to high altitude on land while the gas bubble is still in your eye (up to 12 weeks after surgery).
If you ignore this, the bubble may expand at altitude, causing very high pressure inside your eye. This will result in severe pain and permanent loss of vision."
What if I need another operation shortly after my treatment?,"If you need a general anaesthetic while the gas is still in your eye, it's vital you tell the anaesthetist so they can avoid certain anaesthetic agents that can cause expansion of the bubble."
Can I drive after the operation?,"You probably won't be able to drive for 6 to 8 weeks after your operation while the gas bubble is still present in your eye. Speak to your specialist if you're unsure.
You'll notice the bubble shrinking and will be aware when it has completely gone."
How much time will I need off work?,"Most people will need some time off work, although this will depend to an extent on the type of work you do and the speed of recovery. Discuss this with your surgeon."
What are the possible complications of macular hole surgery?,"It's unlikely you'll suffer harmful effects from a macular hole operation.
However, you should be aware of the following possible complications.
The hole may fail to close, but this normally won't have made your vision any worse, and it's usually possible to repeat the surgery.
You'll almost certainly get a cataract after the surgery, usually within a year if you've not already had a cataract operation. This means the natural lens in your eye has gone cloudy. If you do already have a cataract, it may be removed at the same time the hole is being repaired.
Retinal detachment is when the retina detaches from the back of the eye. It happens in around 6%of people having macular hole surgery. This can potentially cause blindness, but it's usually repairable in a further operation.
Bleeding occurs very rarely, but severe bleeding within the eye can result in blindness.
Infection is also very rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 1,000 patients. An infection needs further treatment and could lead to blindness.
An increase in pressure within the eye is quite common in the days after macular hole surgery, usually due to the expanding gas bubble. In most cases, it's short-lived and controlled with extra eye drops or tablets to reduce the pressure, protecting the eye from damage. If the high pressure is extreme or prolonged, there may be some damage to the optic nerve as a result."
How successful is macular hole surgery?,"The most important factor in predicting whether the hole closes as a result of surgery is the length of time the hole has been present.
If you've had a hole for less than 6 months, there's about a 90% chance your operation will be successful – 9 in 10 operations will successfully close the hole.
If the hole has been present for a year or longer, the success rate will be lower.
Most people have some improvement in vision after they've recovered from the surgery. At the very least, the operation usually prevents your sight from getting any worse.
Your doctor will speak to you in more detail about what results you can expect from the surgery.
Even if surgery does not successfully correct your central vision, a macular hole never affects your peripheral vision, so you'd never go completely blind from this condition."
Can I develop a macular hole in my other eye?,"After carefully examining your other eye, your surgeon should be able to tell you the risk of developing a macular hole in this eye.
In some people this is extremely unlikely, in others there's a 1 in 10 chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye.
It's very important to monitor any changes in the vision of your healthy eye and report these to your eye specialist, GP or optician urgently."
How does it differ from age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"A macular hole is not the same as macular degeneration, although they affect the same area of the eye and can sometimes both be present in the same eye.
AMD is damage to the macula leading to the gradual loss of central vision. It's unclear what causes it, but getting older, smoking and a family history of the condition are known to increase your risk."
Check if you're at risk of malaria,"Malaria is caused by being bitten by an infected mosquito. It can take just 1 bite to get it.
The infection is very common in certain parts of the world.
It's found in tropical regions, including:
large areas of Africa and Asia
Central and South America
Dominican Republic and Haiti
parts of the Middle East
some Pacific islands
Malaria is not found in the UK and you cannot catch it from another person."
How to avoid malaria,"If you're travelling to an area where malaria is found, get advice from a GP, nurse, pharmacist or travel clinic before you go.
It's best to do this at least 4 to 6 weeks before you travel, but you can still get advice at the last minute if you need to.
You may be prescribed antimalarial tablets to reduce the risk of getting malaria and told how you can prevent mosquito bites.
Do
take any antimalarial medicine you're prescribed – you usually need to start taking it a few days or weeks before you go, until a few weeks after you get back
use insect repellent on your skin – make sure it's 50% DEET-based
sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticide
wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs in the evening, when mosquitos are most active"
Symptoms of malaria,"Malaria can be hard to spot, but symptoms include:
a high temperature, sweats and chills
headaches and feeling confused
feeling very tired and sleepy (especially in children)
feeling and being sick, tummy pain and diarrhoea
loss of appetite
muscle pains
yellow skin or whites of the eyes
a sore throat, cough and difficulty breathing
These symptoms usually appear between 7 and 18 days after you've been bitten by an infected mosquito.
But sometimes you may not have symptoms for months after travel, and rarely years."
Treatments for malaria,"Malaria is an emergency and needs to be treated quickly.
It's treated with antimalarial medicines.
Some people will stay in hospital to have specialist care and treatment.
Malaria can sometimes come back and will need to be treated again if this happens."
"Is there such a thing as a ""male menopause""?","The ""male menopause"" (sometimes called the andropause) is an unhelpful term sometimes used in the media.
This label is misleading because it suggests the symptoms are the result of a sudden drop in testosterone in middle age, similar to what occurs in the female menopause. This is not true.
Although testosterone levels fall as men age, the decline is steady at about 1% a year from around the age of 30 to 40, and this is unlikely to cause any problems in itself.
A testosterone deficiency that develops later in life, also known as late-onset hypogonadism, can sometimes be responsible for these symptoms, but in many cases the symptoms are nothing to do with hormones."
Personal or lifestyle issues ,"Lifestyle factors or psychological problems can also be responsible for many of these symptoms.
For example, erectile dysfunction, low sex drive and mood swings may be the result of:
stress
depression
anxiety
There are also physical causes of erectile dysfunction, such as smoking or heart problems, which may happen alongside any psychological cause.
Psychological problems are typically brought on by work or relationship issues, money problems or worrying about ageing parents.
A ""midlife crisis"" can also be responsible. This can happen when men think they have reached life's halfway stage.
Anxieties over what they have accomplished so far, either in their job or personal life, can lead to a period of depression.
Other possible causes of the ""male menopause"" include:
lack of sleep
a poor diet
lack of exercise
drinking too much alcohol
smoking
low self-esteem"
Late-onset hypogonadism ,"In some cases, where lifestyle or psychological problems do not seem to be responsible, the symptoms of the ""male menopause"" may be the result of hypogonadism, where the testes produce few or no hormones.
Hypogonadism is sometimes present from birth, which can cause symptoms like delayed puberty and small testes.
Hypogonadism can also occasionally develop later in life, particularly in men who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.
This is known as late-onset hypogonadism and can cause the ""male menopause"" symptoms.
But this is an uncommon and specific medical condition that's not a normal part of ageing.
A diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism can usually be made based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests used to measure your testosterone levels."
What to do,"If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, see your GP. They'll ask about your work and personal life to see if your symptoms may be caused by a mental health issue, such as stress or anxiety.
If stress or anxiety are affecting you, you may benefit from medication or a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Exercise and relaxation can also help. 
Read about:
stress management
treating anxiety
help for low mood and depression
exercise for depression 
breathing exercises for stress"
Do I need hormone replacement therapy (HRT)?,"Your GP may also order a blood test to measure your testosterone levels.
If the results suggest you have a testosterone deficiency, you may be referred to an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone problems.
If the specialist confirms this diagnosis, you may be offered testosterone replacement to correct the hormone deficiency, which should relieve your symptoms.
This treatment may be given as an injection or a gel."
Check if you have mallet finger,"If you have mallet finger the tip of your finger will bend and you will not be able to straighten it.
Credit:
Your finger may also be:
painful or tender
swollen or bruised"
Things you can do before you get medical help,"If you think you have mallet finger, there are some things you can do while waiting for medical help.
Do
lift your hand up to reduce swelling
take painkillers to help ease the pain
remove any rings from the finger"
Treatment for mallet finger,"If you have mallet finger, the finger needs to be kept straight to let the injury heal.
A doctor or nurse will put the finger in a splint, securing it with tape. You'll still be able to bend your finger at the middle joint.
You'll need to:
keep the splinted finger dry – the skin inside the splint can be sore if it gets wet
wear the splint for up to 8 weeks, only removing it to clean your finger and the splint
If the injury does not heal, you may need to wear the splint again for another 8 weeks.
Rarely, you may need surgery.
Cleaning the finger and splint
Clean the finger and splint every day. It's easier to do this if someone can help you.
It's important to keep the fingertip straight when the splint is off.
Rest your finger flat on a table.
Cut the tape and slide the splint off your finger.
Wash the finger and the splint with soap and water.
Dry the finger and splint.
Slide the splint back into place over your finger, keeping the finger straight.
Put new tape on. The middle joint of your finger can move, but it's important the damaged joint cannot move."
Recovering from mallet finger,"If you have mallet finger, it can take several months for the finger to get back to normal.
Tenderness, swelling and redness are common for the first few months. The redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin.
You may need to take time off work, depending on your job.
Don’t
do not bend your finger, as the injury will not heal
do not do sports or exercise involving your hands
Information:
The doctor or nurse may give you hand exercises to do around 6 to 8 weeks after your injury happened."
Signs and symptoms of malnutrition,"Common signs of malnutrition include:
unintentional weight loss – losing 5% to 10% or more of weight over 3 to 6 months is one of the main signs of malnutrition
a low body weight – people with a body mass index (BMI) under 18.5 are at risk of being malnourished (use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI)
a lack of interest in eating and drinking
feeling tired all the time
feeling weak
getting ill often and taking a long time to recover
in children, not growing or not putting on weight at the expected rate
Read more about the symptoms of malnutrition."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if:
you've unintentionally lost a lot of weight over the last 3 to 6 months
you have other symptoms of malnutrition
you're worried someone in your care, such as a child or older person, may be malnourished
If you're concerned about a friend or family member, try to encourage them to see a GP.
A GP can check if you're at risk of malnutrition by measuring your weight and height, and asking about any medical problems you have or any recent changes in your weight or appetite.
If they think you could be malnourished, they may refer you to a healthcare professional such as a dietitian to discuss treatment."
Who's at risk of malnutrition,"Malnutrition is a common problem that affects millions of people in the UK.
Anyone can become malnourished, but it's more common in people who:
have a long-term health conditions that affect appetite, weight and/or how well nutrients are absorbed by the gut, such as Crohn's disease
have problems swallowing (dysphagia)
are socially isolated, have limited mobility, or a low income
need extra energy, such as people with cystic fibrosis, are recovering from a serious injury or burns, and those with tremors or shaking hands
People who are 65 years and over are particularly at risk, and weight loss is not an inevitable result of old age. Children under the age of five are also at risk.
Read more about the causes of malnutrition."
Treatments for malnutrition,"Treatment for malnutrition depends on your general health and how severely malnourished you are.
The first dietary advice is usually to:
eat ""fortified"" foods that are high in calories and protein
snack between meals
have drinks that contain lots of calories
Some people also need support with underlying issues such as limited mobility. For example, care at home or occupational therapy.
If a child is malnourished, their family or carers may need advice and support to address the underlying reasons why it happened.
If these initial dietary changes are not enough, a doctor, nurse or dietitian may also suggest you take extra nutrients in the form of nutritional drinks or supplements.
If you have difficulty eating and this cannot be managed by making changes such as eating soft or liquid foods, other treatments may be recommended, such as:
a feeding tube – this can be either passed down your nose and into your stomach, or inserted directly into your stomach through the skin of the tummy
nutrition that's given directly into a vein
Read more about how malnutrition is treated."
Preventing malnutrition,"The best way to prevent malnutrition is to eat a healthy, balanced diet.
You need to eat a variety of foods from the main food groups, including:
plenty of fruit and vegetables
plenty of starchy foods such as bread, rice, potatoes, pasta
some milk and diary foods or non-dairy alternatives
some sources of protein, such as meat, fish, eggs and beans
The Eatwell Guide has more information about the types of food you should include in your diet and how to get the right balance between them all.
Speak to a GP or specialist if you have a health problem that puts you at increased risk of malnutrition. You may have more complex dietary needs or need to take supplements."
What causes Marfan syndrome?,"Marfan syndrome is hereditary, which means it can be passed to a child from a parent who's affected.
In around 3 in 4 cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from 1 parent.
The syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means a child can inherit it even if only 1 parent has the syndrome.
There is therefore a 1 in 2 chance that the child of a parent with Marfan syndrome will inherit the syndrome.
The gene defect leads to reduced production of a protein called fibrillin, resulting in parts of the body being able to stretch abnormally when placed under any kind of stress.
The defective fibrillin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should.
This means a person with Marfan syndrome may be tall because their arms and legs grow longer than normal.
In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, neither parent has the syndrome.
In these cases, the fibrillin gene changes (mutates) for the first time in the parent's egg or sperm.
The mutated gene can be passed on to the child, who will then go on to develop the syndrome.
Find out more about genetic inheritance"
Diagnosing Marfan syndrome,"Diagnosing Marfan syndrome can be difficult as the symptoms can vary significantly from person to person.
As the symptoms of Marfan syndrome do not always develop during childhood, it may not be identified until the teenage years.
In most cases, a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on a thorough physical examination and a detailed assessment of a person's medical and family history.
Find out more about how Marfan syndrome is diagnosed"
Treating Marfan syndrome,"There's no cure for Marfan syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.
As Marfan syndrome affects several different parts of the body, you'll be treated by a team of different healthcare professionals.
You'll be closely monitored and any complications will be treated if they occur.
A serious problem caused by Marfan syndrome can occur if the heart and the aorta, the body's main artery, are significantly affected. This can lead to a reduction in the number of years a person is expected to live.
Find out more about the possible treatments for Marfan syndrome"
Information about you,"If you or your child has Marfan syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps researchers to better understand congenital and rare diseases to help make sure that people living with these conditions receive the best possible care.
You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register"
How common is Marfan syndrome?,"Although Marfan syndrome is rare, affecting about 1 in 5,000 people in the UK, it's one of the most common connective tissue disorders.
Men and women are affected equally."
When is a mastectomy recommended?,"A mastectomy may be recommended if:
cancer is in a large area of the breast
cancer has spread throughout the breast
the breast is full of pre-cancerous cells
Some women at high risk of breast cancer choose to have a mastectomy even when there's no sign of cancer."
Preparing for a mastectomy,"Before having a mastectomy, you will have the opportunity to discuss the operation with a specialist breast care nurse or surgeon. You can discuss how the procedure might affect you physically and emotionally.
You'll get practical advice about bras and bra inserts, if you need them.
Your surgeon will discuss the type of mastectomy you'll have, the possible complications and the option of breast reconstruction. You may need to have chemotherapy or hormone therapy before the operation to reduce the size of any tumours."
The operation,"A mastectomy is carried out under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep while it happens.
During the operation, a horizontal or diagonal cut is made across your breast so the tissue can be removed. The amount removed will depend on the type of mastectomy you're having.
The surgeon will usually put one or two drainage tubes in place to stop fluid building up in the breast space. These may be left in for a few days.
Types of mastectomy
Some of the main types of mastectomy are:
standard mastectomy – all of the breast tissue and most of the skin covering it is removed
skin-sparing mastectomy – all of the breast tissue is removed, including the nipple, but most of the skin covering the breast is left
nipple-sparing mastectomy – a skin-sparing mastectomy where the nipple isn't removed
radical mastectomy – a now-rare procedure where all of the breast tissue is removed, as well as the skin covering it, the two muscles behind the breast and the lymph nodes in the armpit
modified radical mastectomy – as above except the large muscle behind the breast (the larger of the two pectoral muscles) is left in place
The operation usually involves removing most of the breast tissue and skin, and the nipple.
Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped balls that help remove bacteria and other waste from the body. If the cancer has spread to them, the lymph nodes under your arm will be removed during the operation.
If pre-surgery tests didn't find cancer in your lymph nodes, a few may be removed during the operation for further testing. If these tests find cancer, you might need radiotherapy or another operation.
Some hospitals are able to test the lymph nodes while you're being operated on, which reduces the need for a second operation."
Breast reconstruction,"If you're having a mastectomy, your surgeon will usually talk to you about the possibility of having breast reconstruction.
Breast reconstruction is an operation to make a replacement for the tissue removed during a mastectomy. It's often done at the same time as a mastectomy, but it can be done at a later date.
Some people decide not to have breast reconstruction.
Find out more about breast reconstruction."
Recovery,"Most people who have a mastectomy recover well. You may wake up with:
a drip in your arm so you can be given fluids
one or more drainage tubes coming from the wound
a dressing to help keep your wound clean
You will probably feel sore for a few days and should be given painkillers in hospital. If they don't work, tell the nursing staff before you leave so you can try something else.
Most people find their wounds take around 2 to 3 weeks to heal, but it may be several months before your chest and arm area fully recover.
The area will be bruised, swollen and stiff at first. You may also have:
painless swelling around your stitches (seroma) – this usually disappears without treatment after several weeks
numbness where your lymph nodes were removed – this should improve with time
Scar
The scar from a mastectomy will extend across the skin of the chest and into the armpit, usually hidden by the bra cup. It will fade over time but never completely disappear. It will also feel permanently numb.
If you don't like the look of your scar, you may be able to have some corrective surgery. Read more about treating scars."
Going home,"Most people go home the day after their operation, although some feel well enough to go home on the same day.
If you've had breast reconstruction, you may need to stay in hospital for up to a week depending on how you're recovering.
Before you leave hospital, your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what to do when you get home. You'll probably feel more tired than usual for several weeks and will need a lot of rest, so try not to do too much.
The results of the operation and any further treatment will be discussed at a follow-up appointment around 2 weeks after the operation.
Arm exercises
Arm exercises are recommended to encourage the full range of movement back to your arm and shoulder.
You can start to do the gentle exercises your doctor or nurse gives you as soon as you feel comfortable, usually the day after your surgery.
You may be given an exercise leaflet – here's an example of an exercise routine from Breast Cancer Now. You may also be offered physiotherapy.
Avoid more strenuous exercise, including housework and heavy lifting, until you get the all-clear from your doctor or nurse.
Bra inserts
Before leaving hospital, you'll have the opportunity to be fitted with a lightweight breast shape (prosthesis) to wear inside your bra.
You'll usually be fitted with a longer-term prosthesis and given advice on bra fitting 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.
Driving
Get advice from your doctor or nurse about when to start driving. Generally, you should be OK to drive if you can make an emergency stop without discomfort in the wound.
Some people are able to drive about 3 weeks after the operation, but it may be sooner or later than this depending on how you feel.
Some insurance companies will not insure drivers for a number of weeks after surgery, so you may want to check your policy.
Returning to work
You can return to work when you feel up to it. Taking 4 to 8 weeks off is fairly typical, but it varies from person to person.
The hospital staff or your GP can supply you with a medical note for your employer if needed."
Complications,"If you're concerned your wound isn't healing well, contact hospital staff or your GP.
Get urgent medical advice if:
your wound becomes infected – it may be red, painful or swollen, or ooze liquid
your arm and hand become swollen and sore because of a build-up of fluid (lymphoedema)
your wound is bleeding"
Emotional support,"Recovering from a mastectomy can be emotionally difficult. You may find it helpful, before and after your mastectomy, to talk to others who have had the operation.
You can get information on contacting others who have had a mastectomy from your doctor or nurse, or from organisations such as:
Macmillan Cancer Support
Cancer Research UK
Breast Cancer Now
Find cancer support services near you."
Check if you have mastitis,"Mastitis usually only affects 1 breast, and symptoms often come on quickly. They include:
a swollen area on your breast that may feel hot and painful to touch – the area may become red but this can be harder to see if you have black or brown skin
a wedge-shaped breast lump or a hard area on your breast
a burning pain in your breast that might be constant or only when you breastfeed
nipple discharge, which may be white or contain streaks of blood
You may also get flu-like symptoms, such as aches, a high temperature, chills and tiredness."
Things you can do to ease mastitis,"Do
if you are breastfeeding, continue to breastfeed your baby when they want and for as long as they want. You can also offer your baby a breastfeed if your breasts are uncomfortably full
when breastfeeding make sure your baby is positioned and attached properly. Your midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist can advise you.
a cloth soaked in warm water and applied to the breast (or a shower or bath) may improve milk flow
breast pain may be soothed using a cold compress (for example a cloth soaked in cold water)
rest and drink lots of fluids
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce any pain or high temperature
Don’t
do not wear tight-fitting clothing or bras until you feel better
do not take aspirin
do not express more milk than your baby needs
do not apply firm pressure to the breast - any pressure should be gentle
do not stop breastfeeding suddenly –  find out how to stop breastfeeding
do not apply oils, soaks or creams to your breast"
Treatment for mastitis from a GP,"A GP will usually prescribe antibiotics if you have mastitis and your symptoms are not getting better.
If you're breastfeeding a very small amount of the antibiotic may go into your breast milk. There is no risk to your baby, but it might make them irritable and restless.
What to do if mastitis comes back
If you are breastfeeding and keep getting mastitis, it might be due to problems with positioning and attaching.
If you have any breastfeeding problems, it's important to ask for help from a midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist as soon as possible."
Causes of mastitis,"Mastitis is common in breastfeeding women as it can be caused by a build-up of milk.
Women who are not breastfeeding can also get mastitis, as can men. This can be caused by:
smoking – toxins found in tobacco can damage breast tissue
damage to the nipple, such as a piercing or skin condition such as eczema
having a breast implant
having a weakened immune system due to a health condition such as diabetes
shaving or plucking hairs from around your nipples"
Mast cells,"Mast cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue found in the hollow centres of some bones, and live longer than normal cells. They're an important part of the immune system and help fight infection.
When mast cells detect a substance that triggers an allergic reaction (an allergen), they release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream.
Histamine makes the blood vessels expand and the surrounding skin itchy and swollen. It can also create a build-up of mucus in the airways, which become narrower."
Symptoms of mastocytosis,"The symptoms of mastocytosis can vary depending on the type.
Cutaneous mastocytosis
The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin, such as bumps and spots, which can form on the body and sometimes blister.
Systemic mastocytosis
Some people with systemic mastocytosis may experience episodes of severe symptoms, often with specific triggers such as physical exertion or stress. Many people do not have any problems.
During an episode you may have:
skin reactions – such as itching and flushing
gut symptoms – such as diarrhoea and vomiting
muscle and joint pain
mood changes, headaches and tiredness (fatigue)
There are 3 main subtypes of systemic mastocytosis. They are:
indolent systemic mastocytosis – symptoms are usually mild to moderate and vary from person to person; indolent systemic mastocytosis accounts for around 90% of adult systemic mastocytosis cases
aggressive mastocytosis – where mast cells multiply in organs, such as the spleen, liver and digestive system; the symptoms are more wide-ranging and severe, although skin lesions are less common
systemic mastocytosis with associated blood (haematological) disease – where a condition that affects the blood cells, such as chronic leukaemia, also develops
Severe allergic reaction
People with mastocytosis have an increased risk of developing a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. This is known as anaphylaxis.
The increased risk of anaphylaxis is caused by the abnormally high number of mast cells and their potential to release large amounts of histamine into the blood.
If you or your child has mastocytosis, you may need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector, which can be used to treat the symptoms of anaphylaxis. 
Read more about the symptoms of mastocytosis."
Causes of mastocytosis,"The cause or causes of mastocytosis are not fully known, but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation.
The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF).
SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells, such as blood cells and mast cells, inside the bone marrow.  
In very few cases of mastocytosis it appears the KIT mutation is passed down through families. However, in most cases the mutation happens for no apparent reason."
Diagnosing mastocytosis,"A physical examination of the skin is the first stage in diagnosing cutaneous mastocytosis.
Your GP or skin specialist (dermatologist) may rub the affected areas of skin to see if they become red, inflamed and itchy. This is known as Darier's sign.
It's usually possible to confirm a diagnosis by carrying out a biopsy, where a small skin sample is taken and checked for mast cells.
The following tests are commonly used to look for systemic mastocytosis:
blood tests – including a full blood count (FBC) and measuring blood tryptase levels
an ultrasound scan to look for enlargement of the liver and spleen if it seems likely
a DEXA scan to measure bone density
a bone marrow biopsy test – where a local anaesthetic is used and a long needle is inserted through the skin into the bone underneath, usually in the pelvis
A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy."
Treating mastocytosis,"There's no cure for mastocytosis, so the aim of treatment is to try to relieve the symptoms.
Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms.
Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream (topical corticosteroids) for a short time.
Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin.
Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis, such as red skin and itchiness.
Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of histamine and are often used to treat allergic conditions.
Read more about treating mastocytosis."
Complications of mastocytosis,"In children, the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis usually improve over time, but remain stable in adults.
In many cases the condition gets better on its own by the time a child has reached puberty.
The outlook for systemic mastocytosis can vary, depending on the type you have.
Indolent systemic mastocytosis should not affect life expectancy, but other types can. 
A few people develop a serious blood condition, such as chronic leukaemia, over their lifetime."
Check if you or your child has mastoiditis,"The symptoms of mastoiditis usually include:
pain, soreness or tenderness behind the ear
redness behind the ear (this can be harder to see on brown or black skin)
swelling behind the ear, which can cause it to stick out
discharge from the ear
a high temperature
tiredness and irritability
headache
hearing loss in the affected ear
You're more likely to get mastoiditis if you have a severe ear infection or get lots of ear infections."
What happens at your GP appointment,"Mastoiditis is a serious infection and should be diagnosed and treated quickly.
If you have symptoms of mastoiditis, a GP will use a small magnifying lens called an otoscope to check for infection inside the ear.
If the GP thinks you have mastoiditis, they'll refer you to an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist at a hospital.
Sometimes a scan may be needed to show the mastoid bone in more detail."
Treatments for mastoiditis,"If you have mastoiditis, you'll be treated by an ear specialist in hospital.
The main treatment is antibiotics. These are given directly into a vein through a drip (intravenously).
You'll usually need to stay in hospital for 1 or 2 days to make sure the antibiotics are working.
If your symptoms start to get better, you may be given antibiotic tablets to take at home.
If antibiotics do not work or the infection gets worse, you may need:
treatment to drain pus from your ear using a needle or by making a small cut in or behind the ear
surgery to remove part of the mastoid bone (mastoidectomy)"
Is MCADD serious?,"MCADD is a potentially serious condition that can be life-threatening if not recognised quickly and treated appropriately.
However, most cases are picked up soon after birth and can be managed quite easily.
With proper care, there's no reason why someone with MCADD cannot live a normal, healthy and active life."
Symptoms of MCADD,"Babies with MCADD are at risk of developing the following symptoms:
irritability
poor feeding
sleepiness
floppiness
breathing difficulties
vomiting
seizures (fits)
coma
If your baby is ill or is not feeding well, they should be given a special high-sugar drink, known as glucose polymer. This is called the emergency regimen.
Families with a child with MCADD are taught how to prepare and give the emergency regimen.
If you see no improvement after giving the emergency regimen, you should take your child to your nearest A&E department immediately.
Take any relevant paperwork about your child's MCADD with you and tell hospital staff your child has MCADD.
It's also helpful to contact your specialist care team to say you are on your way but do not delay going to hospital."
What causes MCADD?,"MCADD is caused by a fault in the gene that provides the instructions to make an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD).
This genetic fault causes the enzyme to either not work properly or be missing entirely, which means the body cannot fully break down fat to release energy.
If the body needs to break down fat quickly (for example, if you're unwell and have not eaten for a while), energy cannot be produced quickly enough to meet the body's needs and substances created when fat is partially broken down can build up to harmful levels in the body.
This can lead to serious problems if not treated quickly."
How MCADD is inherited,"A child will only be born with MCADD if they inherit a copy of the faulty gene that causes it from both of their parents.
The parents will not normally have the condition themselves because they usually only have one copy of the faulty gene each. This is known as being a ""carrier"".
If both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there's a:
1 in 4 chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and will not have MCADD or be able to pass it on
1 in 2 chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier
1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have MCADD
Read more about genetic and genomic testing"
Screening and testing for MCADD,"A newborn blood spot test is now offered to all babies in England to earlier help detect problems including MCADD. 
When your baby is 5 to 8 days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate MCADD.
You should receive the results by the time your baby is 6 to 8 weeks old. You'll be contacted sooner if a problem is found so you can attend a hospital appointment to discuss this further.
If your baby has a screen positive result, further urine and blood tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes MCADD.
If you've previously had a child with MCADD, the newborn blood spot test should be carried out within 24 to 48 hours of birth."
How MCADD is treated,"There's no specific treatment for MCADD. A specialist care team will give you advice about how to look after your child and support them as they get older.
They will also:
arrange regular follow-up appointments
provide you with contact details for your specialist care team and written information
Children and adults with MCADD can eat a normal diet, as long as they:
frequently take special high-sugar drinks when they're ill – this includes common illnesses such as a high temperature, diarrhoea, or vomiting
avoid long periods without eating during the newborn period and infancy even when well – the length of time your child can go without eating is known as the maximum ""safe fasting time"" and it varies depending on age; you'll be given advice about this
The high-sugar drinks used for treating MCADD are available on prescription from a GP. You'll be advised by a specialist dietitian about when to use them and how much to use. If the drinks do not help or your child refuses them, they may need to be treated in hospital.
You can find more detailed information about MCADD treatment in the British Inherited Metabolic Diseases Group (BIMDG) MCADD information sheet for parents and carers (PDF, 116kb)."
Information about you,"If you or your child has MCADD, your clinical team will pass information about you or them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register on GOV.UK"
Support groups,"In addition to the support of your care team, you may find it useful to contact a national or local support group for people with MCADD and their families.
One of the main groups in the UK is Metabolic Support UK. You can find information about MCADD on its website and you can speak to their Family Advisers for free on 0845 241 2173."
Check if you or your child has measles,"Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms, followed by a rash a few days later. Some people may also get small spots in their mouth.
Cold-like symptoms
The first symptoms of measles include:
a high temperature
a runny or blocked nose
sneezing
a cough
red, sore, watery eyes
Spots in the mouth
Credit:
Small white spots may appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips a few days later. These spots usually last a few days.
The measles rash
A rash usually appears a few days after the cold-like symptoms.
The rash starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body.
Credit:
Credit:
The spots of the measles rash are sometimes raised and join together to form blotchy patches. They're not usually itchy.
Credit:
The rash looks brown or red on white skin. It may be harder to see on brown and black skin.

Credit:"
How to look after yourself or your child,"Measles usually starts to get better in about a week.
After seeing a GP, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
It can help to:
rest and drink plenty fluids, such as water, to avoid dehydration
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve a high temperature – do not give aspirin to children under 16 years
use cotton wool soaked in warm water to gently remove any crusts from your or your child's eyes
Important
Stay off nursery, school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears.
Also try to avoid close contact with babies and anyone who is pregnant or has a weakened immune system."
How to avoid spreading or catching measles,"Measles is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There are things you can do to reduce the risk of spreading or catching it.
Do
wash your hands often with soap and warm water
use tissues when you cough or sneeze
throw used tissues in the bin
Don’t
do not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding"
Complications of measles,"Measles can lead to serious problems if it spreads to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain.
Problems that can be caused by measles include:
pneumonia
meningitis
blindness
seizures (fits)
These problems are rare, but some people are more at risk. This includes babies and people with weakened immune systems.
Measles in pregnancy
If you get measles when you're pregnant, it could harm your baby.
It can cause:
miscarriage or stillbirth
premature birth (before the 37th week of pregnancy)
your baby having a low birthweight
It's important to get medical advice if you're pregnant and have been in close contact with someone who has measles."
Get vaccinated against measles,"The MMR vaccine can prevent measles. It also protects you from mumps and rubella.
The MMR vaccine is offered to all children in the UK. 2 doses can give lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella.
Ask at your GP surgery if you're not sure you or your child have had the vaccine. They can give it for free on the NHS."
Which medicines can I buy without prescription?,"Some medicines for minor illnesses can be bought over the counter without a prescription, so you can treat yourself without needing to see a GP.
Simple painkillers and cough remedies, for example, can be bought directly from supermarkets and other stores.
Other types of medicine, such as eyedrops or emergency contraception, are available without a prescription but need a pharmacist's supervision, so are only available to buy from behind the pharmacy counter. The pharmacist may ask you questions to make sure the medicine is suitable for you.
Prescription-only medicines, such as antibiotics, must be prescribed by a qualified health professional.
This may be a GP, hospital doctor, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, optometrist, physiotherapist, podiatrist, paramedic or therapeutic radiographer."
Buying medicines online,"You can also buy medicines online. But be very careful if you do this, as many websites sell fake medicines.
Many websites selling medicines are not registered as pharmacies, so buying from them is potentially unsafe. Medicine from an unregistered website could be dangerous to your health because it might be out of date, diluted or fake, or may not be suitable for you.
It's best to see your GP before buying medicines online as they know your medical history and can advise you whether the medicine would be suitable.
If you choose to buy medicines online, ensure that:
any online pharmacy is registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)
any online doctor service is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the General Medical Council (GMC)"
Brand names versus generics,"Many medicines have at least 2 different names:
the brand name – created by the pharmaceutical company that made the medicine
the generic name – the name of the active ingredient in the medicine
For example, sildenafil is the generic name of a medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. But the company that makes sildenafil, Pfizer, sells it under the brand name Viagra.
Companies take out exclusive rights called patents on each new medicine they discover. If a company has a patent on a medicine, only that company can market it under their brand name once it's been granted a licence.
Once the patent expires, other manufacturers can market generic versions. The generic versions will be the same as the branded medicine because they contain the same active ingredients.
They are used more often by the NHS because they're just as effective but cost far less. It's similar to buying branded goods or a supermarket's own label – the supermarket's version is usually cheaper.
If the name of your prescription medicine keeps changing, it might be because you're being given different brands of the same medicine, or the generic version rather than the branded one."
How new medicines become available,"Licensed medicines
Before any new medicine can be used to treat people in the UK, it goes through a strictly monitored development process.
This involves researching the medicine in the lab and testing it in clinical trials. After passing the clinical trials, a licence will be granted before it can be made available for wider use.
Read more about clinical trials.
Licences are only granted if strict safety and quality standards are met. In the UK, licences are granted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
Licences confirm the health condition the medicine should be used for and the recommended dosage.
This can be found in the information leaflet that comes with the medicine. The dosage instructions are usually on the label of the medicine packet.
Unlicensed medicines
Sometimes a healthcare professional may recommend that you take an off-label or unlicensed medicine.
Off-label use means that the medicine isn't licensed for treatment of your condition. But the medicine will have a licence to treat another condition and will have undergone clinical trials for this.
Your doctor may recommend an unlicensed medication if they think it will treat your condition effectively and the benefits are greater than any risks."
Safety of medicines,"No medicine is completely risk free, but the MHRA tries to ensure any medicine approved for treating people in the UK is as safe as possible.
Medicines continue to be carefully regulated after they've been licensed. This involves checking for problems and previously unknown side effects.
In rare cases, medicines may be withdrawn if there are serious safety concerns or the risks of the medicines outweigh the benefits.
You can help the MHRA monitor the safety of medicines by reporting any suspected side effects to the Yellow Card Scheme. Reports can also be made on behalf of someone you're caring for."
Symptoms of meningitis,"Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:
a high temperature (fever)
being sick
a headache
a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it (but a rash will not always develop)
a stiff neck
a dislike of bright lights
drowsiness or unresponsiveness
seizures (fits)
These symptoms can appear in any order. You do not always get all the symptoms."
When to get medical help,"Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E immediately if you think you or someone you look after could have meningitis or sepsis.
Trust your instincts and do not wait for all the symptoms to appear or until a rash develops. Someone with meningitis or sepsis can get a lot worse very quickly.
Call NHS 111 for advice if you're not sure if it's anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis.
If you've had medical advice and are still worried or any symptoms get worse, get medical help again."
How meningitis is spread,"Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection.
Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis.
Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through:
sneezing
coughing
kissing
Meningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but are not ill themselves.
It can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common."
Vaccinations against meningitis,"Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis.
These include the:
MenB vaccine – offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks and a booster at 1 year
6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age
pneumococcal vaccine – 2 doses offered to babies at 12 weeks and 1 year, and a single dose offered to adults aged 65 or over
Hib/MenC vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year of age
MMR vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months
MenACWY vaccine – offered to teenagers, sixth formers and ""fresher"" students going to university for the first time"
Treatments for meningitis,"People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.
Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week.
Treatments include:
antibiotics given directly into a vein
fluids given directly into a vein
oxygen through a face mask
Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home.
Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime."
Outlook for meningitis ,"Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems.
Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious long-term problems.
These can include:
hearing loss or vision loss, which may be partial or total
problems with memory and concentration
recurrent seizures (epilepsy)
co-ordination, movement and balance problems
loss of limbs – amputation of affected limbs is sometimes necessary
Overall, it's estimated up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.
Find out more about the complications of meningitis"
Check if it's period pain,"Period pain usually happens to women around the start of their period. It can affect anyone who has periods.
You may have period pain if:
you have pain in your tummy at the start of your period, or several days before your period
you have painful cramps in your tummy that spread to your back and thighs
you have a sharp pain or a dull ache in your tummy
Period pain usually lasts for up to 3 days and can affect your daily activities."
How you can ease period pain,"There are some things you can do to help ease period pain.
Do
have a warm bath or shower
use a heat pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a tea towel on your tummy
try massaging your tummy and back
try some gentle exercise like yoga, swimming, walking or cycling
use painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen
Information:
Cutting down on alcohol and not smoking may also help ease period pain."
Causes of period pain,"Period pain happens when your womb tightens during your period. It's often a normal part of the menstrual cycle.
Sometimes painful periods can be caused by a condition such as:
womb tissue growing in other places (endometriosis and adenomyosis)
growths in and around the womb (fibroids)
an infection of the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries (pelvic inflammatory disease)
An intrauterine device (IUD) can also cause period pain, particularly during the first 3 to 6 months after it's put in."
Treatments for period pain,"If you have severe period pain, a GP may recommend:
anti-inflammatory medicines like naproxen, flurbiprofen or mefenamic acid
a TENS machine – a small device that uses mild electrical impulses to reduce pain
contraception like the pill, implant or injection – these thin the womb lining, making your period lighter and easing the pain
The GP may refer you to a specialist (gynaecologist) if your period pain does not get better.
You might need tests, such as an ultrasound scan, to find out what's causing your period pain. If a condition is found, treating it will help.
For example, if you have fibroids, you may be given medicine to shrink them or have surgery to remove them. If you have pelvic inflammatory disease, you'll usually need antibiotics."
Symptoms of mesothelioma,"The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically do not appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.
Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include:
chest pain
shortness of breath
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
a high temperature and sweating, particularly at night
a persistent cough
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
clubbed (swollen) fingertips
Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include:
tummy pain or swelling
feeling or being sick
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
diarrhoea or constipation
See a GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past."
What causes mesothelioma?,"Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction.
These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. 
It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos.
The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. But materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.
Read more about asbestosis."
How mesothelioma is diagnosed,"If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they'll refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.
A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including:
an X-ray of your chest or tummy
a CT scan – a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body
fluid drainage – if there's a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed
a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that's inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed
These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it's spread."
Treatments for mesothelioma,"The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.
As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. 
This is known as palliative or supportive care.
Possible treatments include:
chemotherapy – this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer
radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control
surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful
immunotherapy – this involves using a combination of 2 medicines to help stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells; immunotherapy cannot cure mesothelioma, but it can slow the spread of the disease and prolong lifespan
You'll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible.
For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain.
Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home.
Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you."
Outlook for mesothelioma,"Unfortunately, the outlook for mesothelioma tends to be poor. This is because it does not usually cause any obvious symptoms until late on and can progress quite quickly once it reaches this stage.
There are currently around 2,500 deaths from mesothelioma each year in the UK. This number is expected to drop in the future because asbestos was banned in 1999."

Symptoms of metabolic syndrome,"You may not have any symptoms of metabolic syndrome.
You usually find out you have it after a blood test or check-up."
Check if you're at risk of metabolic syndrome,"Metabolic syndrome is very common. It's not known what causes it.
It is linked to insulin resistance. This is when your body does not respond to the hormone insulin properly. It may also be linked to having too much fat around your tummy.
You are more likely to get metabolic syndrome if you:
are living with obesity
eat a high-saturated-fat diet
do not exercise much
have a Hispanic or South Asian background
smoke
drink a lot of alcohol
Your risk of getting metabolic syndrome also increases as you get older."
Tests for metabolic syndrome,"If your GP or hospital specialist thinks you have metabolic syndrome, they will:
ask about medical conditions you or family members have
check your body mass index (BMI) and waist measurement

How do you catch MERS?," syndrome coronavirus (also known as MERS or MERS-CoV) is a rare but severe respiratory illness.
It can start with a fever and cough, which can develop into pneumonia and breathing difficulties.
MERS was first identified in 2012 in the Middle East and is most common in that region.
The risk of infection with MERS to people in the UK is very low.
How do you catch MERS?
MERS is spread between animals and people. There's evidence that camels in the Middle East are the main source of the virus.
MERS can also be passed from person to person through cough droplets. But it does not seem to be very contagious between people unless they're in close contact.
There have been 5 cases of MERS in the UK since 2012. The most recent case was identified in August 2018, with previous cases diagnosed in 2012-13.
Symptoms of MERS
Symptoms include:
fever
cough
difficulty breathing
diarrhoea and vomiting
You should call a GP or NHS 111 if you have symptoms and believe you could have caught the infection – for instance, if you have recently been to the Middle East or have been in contact with someone with a confirmed infection.
Treatment for MERS
There's no specific treatment for MERS. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms.
Around 35% of people who get MERS die as a result of the infection.
Advice to travellers going to the Middle East
All travellers, particularly those with long-term medical conditions, should practise good hygiene.
This means regularly washing your hands with soap and water, especially after visiting farms, barns or market areas.
You should also:
avoid contact with camels
avoid raw camel milk and/or camel products
avoid eating or drinking any type of raw milk, raw milk products, and any food that may be contaminated with animal secretions, unless it's been peeled and cleaned and/or thoroughly cooked
Advice to travellers returning from the Middle East
If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning from the Middle East, you should get medical advice.
Call NHS 111 or a GP."
Check if it's a migraine,"A migraine tends to be a very bad headache with a throbbing pain on 1 side of the head.
You may get other symptoms just before a migraine, such as:
feeling very tired and yawning a lot
craving certain foods or feeling thirsty
changes in your mood
a stiff neck
peeing more
You may also get warning signs you're about to have a migraine (called an aura), such as:
problems with your sight, such as seeing zigzag lines or flashing lights
numbness or a tingling that feels like pins and needles
feeling dizzy
difficulty speaking
Aura symptoms should not last for longer than an hour.
There are different types of migraine with different symptoms.
Types of migraine
Symptoms Migraine type
No warning signs
Migraine without aura
Warning signs like seeing zigzag lines, numbness or tingling, feeling dizzy or difficulty speaking just before the migraine starts
Migraine with aura
Symptoms like flashing lights, but no headache
Migraine aura without headache (silent migraine)
Migraines usually last between 2 hours and 3 days, with some symptoms (such as feeling very tired) starting up to 2 days before the head pain starts and finishing after the headache stops.
Some people have migraines several times a week, while others do not have them very often.
Most people find their migraines slowly get better as they get older."
Treatment for migraines,"Migraine treatments include:
painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol
medicines called triptans
medicines that stop you feeling sick or being sick
You may have to try a combination of medicines before you find something that works.
A GP may also recommend making changes to your lifestyle to help manage your migraines, such as eating at regular times and drinking less caffeine.
If your migraines are severe, you might be offered other things to help, such as learning relaxation techniques and acupuncture.
If these treatments do not manage your migraines, you may be offered a new type of medicine called a gepant. These work in a different way than other migraine medicines, so may be of more use to you.
The Migraine Trust has more information on gepants
If none of these treatments help your symptoms, or they're getting worse, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
Important
Try not to take high doses of painkillers too often as this could make it harder to treat your migraines."
Causes of migraines,"It's not known what causes migraines.
You're more likely to get them if you have a close family member who gets them.
Some people find certain triggers can cause migraines, such as:
starting their period
anxiety and depression
stress and tiredness
not eating regularly or skipping meals
too much caffeine
not getting enough exercise
It can help to keep a migraine diary to help you work out what might trigger your migraines."
Things you can do to ease or reduce migraines,"There are things you can do yourself to manage your migraines, with help and advice from a GP.
Do
try sleeping or lying down in a darkened room during a migraine
try to avoid things you know trigger your migraines, such as certain foods
stay well hydrated and limit how much caffeine and alcohol you drink
try to keep to a healthy weight
eat meals at regular times
get regular exercise
get plenty of sleep
try to manage your stress"
Symptoms of a miscarriage,"The main sign of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, which may be followed by cramping and pain in your lower abdomen.
If you have vaginal bleeding, contact a GP or your midwife.
Most GPs can refer you to an early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away if necessary.
You may be referred to a maternity ward if your pregnancy is at a later stage.
But bear in mind that light vaginal bleeding is relatively common during the first trimester (first 3 months) of pregnancy and does not necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage."
Causes of a miscarriage,"There are potentially many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause is not usually identified.
The majority are not caused by anything you have done.
It's thought most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby.
Chromosomes are genetic ""building blocks"" that guide the development of a baby.
If a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes, it will not develop properly.
In most cases, a miscarriage is a one-off event and most people go on to have a successful pregnancy in the future."
Preventing a miscarriage,"The majority of miscarriages cannot be prevented.
But there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of a miscarriage.
Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and using drugs while pregnant.
Being a healthy weight before getting pregnant, eating a healthy diet and reducing your risk of infection can also help."
What happens if you think you're having a miscarriage,"If you have the symptoms of a miscarriage, you'll usually be referred to a hospital for tests.
In most cases, an ultrasound scan can determine if you're having a miscarriage.
When a miscarriage is confirmed, you'll need to talk to your doctor or midwife about the options for the management of the end of the pregnancy.
Often the pregnancy tissue will pass out naturally in 1 or 2 weeks.
Sometimes medicine to assist the passage of the tissue may be recommended, or you can choose to have minor surgery to remove it if you do not want to wait."
After a miscarriage,"A miscarriage can be an emotionally and physically draining experience.
You may have feelings of guilt, shock and anger.
Advice and support are available at this time from hospital counselling services and charity groups.
You may also find it beneficial to have a memorial for the baby you lost.
You can try for another baby as soon as your symptoms have settled and you're emotionally and physically ready.
It's important to remember that most miscarriages are a one-off and are followed by a healthy pregnancy."
How common are miscarriages?,"Miscarriages are much more common than most people realise.
It's thought around 1 in 8 known pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Many miscarriages happen before someone knows they're pregnant.
Losing 3 or more pregnancies in a row (recurrent miscarriages) is uncommon and only affects around 1 in 100 women."
Causes of missed or late periods,"Many women will have missed or late periods at some time. Missed or late periods can affect anyone who has periods.
Common causes of a missed or late period include:
being pregnant
stress
the start of menopause (perimenopause), usually between the ages of 45 and 55
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
sudden weight loss
being overweight
doing too much exercise
taking the contraceptive pill
breastfeeding
Sometimes the gap between your periods may just vary each time. Your periods might come early or late. This is known as having irregular periods.
Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as heart disease, diabetes or an overactive thyroid."
Treatment for missed or late periods,"Treatment for late or missed period depends on what is causing it.
A GP may refer you to a specialist (gynaecologist or endocrinologist) if you need tests or scans to find out what's causing you to miss your periods.
Examples of treatments include:
the combined contraceptive pill to help make your periods more regular if you have a condition like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if you are starting menopause (perimenopause)
A GP can also provide advice or therapy to help you reduce stress and help you to maintain a healthy weight."
Finding out you have a molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy may not have any symptoms, or you may have some symptoms of pregnancy.
You may find out about a molar pregnancy during your 1st pregnancy ultrasound scan at around 8 to 14 weeks.
Some people find out after their pregnancy ends with a miscarriage."
Tests for a molar pregnancy,"If a midwife or doctor thinks you have a molar pregnancy, you'll need:
blood tests to check your level of the pregnancy hormone hCG, which is usually higher than normal in a molar pregnancy
an ultrasound scan
an appointment with a specialist (gynaecologist) or at an early pregnancy assessment unit
Finding out you have a molar pregnancy can be very difficult. A doctor or midwife can give you advice about the support that's available."
Treatment for a molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy will not be able to survive.
It may end on its own, with a miscarriage.
If this does not happen, it's usually treated with a procedure to remove the pregnancy.
You'll usually be given a general anaesthetic before the procedure, so you'll be asleep.
Sometimes you might be able to take medicine to end a molar pregnancy.
Follow-up care
After treatment for a molar pregnancy you'll have regular blood and urine tests to check your hCG hormone level is returning to normal.
If your hormone level does not return to normal you'll need further treatment."
"Sex, contraception, and trying for a baby after a molar pregnancy","You can have sex as soon as you feel ready, but it's important to use contraception while you're getting follow-up care. Talk to a GP about what type of contraception is right for you.
Having a molar pregnancy does not affect your chances of getting pregnant again. But it's important to wait until your doctor tells you it's safe before you start trying for a baby."
Causes of a molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy happens by chance. It's not caused by either parent doing something wrong.
You may be more likely to have a molar pregnancy if:
you're a young teenager or over 45 years old when you get pregnant
you've had a molar pregnancy before
you have an Asian background"
Types of molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy is sometimes called a hydatidiform mole.
There are 2 types of molar pregnancy:
a complete molar pregnancy – this is where abnormal cells grow in the womb after conception and there's no sign of a baby
a partial molar pregnancy – this is where there may be early signs of a baby, but it cannot fully develop or survive"
Where to find help and support for a molar pregnancy,"It can take time to recover after a molar pregnancy, both physically and emotionally.
The specialists looking after you can give you advice if you need support. They may be able to recommend support services in your area.

They often have uneven edges.
Credit:
Sometimes they may bleed, itch, or be crusty or raised.
Credit:"
Treatments for moles,"Moles only need treating if they're a sign of melanoma.
If the GP thinks your mole is melanoma, you'll be referred to a specialist in hospital. You should get an appointment within 2 weeks.
The main treatment for melanoma is surgery to remove the mole.
Cosmetic mole removal
Most moles are harmless. Harmless moles are not usually treated on the NHS.
You can pay a private clinic to remove a mole, but it may be expensive."
How to prevent cancerous moles,"UV light from the sun can increase the chance of a mole becoming cancerous. If you have lots of moles, you need to be extra careful in the sun.
It's important to check your moles regularly for any changes.
There are some things you can do to protect your moles from sun damage, especially during hot weather.
Do
stay in the shade between 11am and 3pm, when sunlight is strongest
cover skin with clothes – wear a hat and sunglasses if you have moles on your face
regularly apply a high-factor sunscreen (minimum SPF30) and apply it again after swimming
Don’t
do not use sunlamps or sunbeds – they use UV light"
Check if it's molluscum contagiosum,"Molluscum contagiosum is more common in children, but anyone can get it.
Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is spots.
The spots are about 2 to 5mm wide and usually appear together. They are raised and dome-shaped with a shiny white dimple in the middle.
Credit:
Children with the infection often get spots on their body and in or around folds of skin (groin, behind the knee and armpits).
Credit:
In adults where the infection is spread through sexual contact, spots may be around the lower tummy, genital area and thighs.
Credit:


Someone with a weakened immune system may get spots on the face, around the eyes or have many or bigger spots.
Credit:"
How to look after yourself or your child,"The spots caused by molluscum contagiosum are usually harmless and should clear up within 18 months without needing treatment.
Molluscum contagiosum is contagious. It is usually passed on by direct skin to skin contact.
The chance of passing it on to other people during normal activities is small so you or your child should be able to carry on with your normal activities. If you are not sure, check with a GP.
There are some things you can do to help reduce the risk of the infection spreading and help ease any symptoms.
Do
try things to help with dryness and itchy skin, such as holding a damp towel against the skin, having cool baths or using an unperfumed moisturiser regularly
keep the affected area covered, including using waterproof bandages if you go swimming
use a condom while having sex if you are infected
Don’t
do not squeeze or scratch the spots, as it could cause an infection or scarring
do not share baths or things such as towels, bedding or clothes"
Treating molluscum contagiosum,"It's rare to need treatment for molluscum contagiosum because it usually clears up on its own.
But treatment may be recommended if the spots are causing problems.
For example, a GP may suggest:
antibiotics if your spots become infected
steroid cream to treat skin that's itchy, dry or sore (like an eczema rash)
A GP may refer you to a specialist for tests and treatment if:
you have lots of spots or the spots are having a big impact on your life
you have spots near your eyelids or eyes
you have a weakened immune system – for example, if you’re having chemotherapy or have HIV"
Check if you have Morton's neuroma,"Morton's neuroma usually affects the nerves between your 3rd and 4th toes.
Credit:
The main symptoms of Morton's neuroma include:
a shooting, stabbing or burning pain
feeling like a pebble or lump is stuck under your foot
Some people may also have tingling or numbness in their foot.

Find a pharmacy"
Causes of motion sickness,"Motion sickness is caused by repeated movements when travelling, like going over bumps in a car or moving up and down in a boat, plane or train.
The inner ear sends different signals to your brain from those your eyes are seeing. These confusing messages cause you to feel unwell."
Symptoms of motor neurone disease,"Symptoms of motor neurone disease happen gradually and may not be obvious at first.
Early symptoms can include:
weakness in your ankle or leg – you might trip, or find it harder to climb stairs
slurred speech, which may develop into difficulty swallowing some foods
a weak grip – you might drop things, or find it hard to open jars or do up buttons
muscle cramps and twitches
weight loss – your arms or leg muscles may have become thinner over time
difficulty stopping yourself from crying or laughing in inappropriate situations"
Who gets motor neurone disease and why,"Motor neurone disease is an uncommon condition that mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages.
It's caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves called motor neurones.
These cells gradually stop working over time. It's not known why this happens.
Having a close relative with motor neurone disease, or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia, can sometimes mean you're more likely to get it.
But it does not run in families in most cases."
When to see a GP,"You should see a GP if you have possible early symptoms of motor neurone disease, such as muscle weakness. It's unlikely you have motor neurone disease, but getting a correct diagnosis as early as possible can help you get the care and support you need.
You should also see a GP if a close relative has motor neurone disease or frontotemporal dementia and you're worried you may be at risk of it. The GP may refer you for genetic counselling to talk about your risk and the tests you can have."
Tests and diagnosis,"It can be difficult to diagnose motor neurone disease in the early stages.
There's no single test for it and several conditions cause similar symptoms.
To help rule out other conditions, a neurologist may arrange:
blood tests
a scan of your brain and spine
tests to measure the electrical activity in your muscles and nerves
a lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) – when a thin needle is used to remove and test the fluid from within your spine"
Treatment and support,"There's no cure for motor neurone disease, but treatment can help reduce the impact the symptoms have on your life.
You'll be cared for by a team of specialists and a GP.
Treatments include:
highly specialised clinics, typically involving a specialist nurse and occupational therapy to help make everyday tasks easier
physiotherapy and exercises to maintain strength and reduce stiffness
advice from a speech and language therapist
advice from a dietitian about diet and eating
a medicine called riluzole that can slightly slow down the progression of the condition
medicines to relieve muscle stiffness and help with saliva problems
emotional support for you and your carer"
How it progresses,"Motor neurone disease gets gradually worse over time.
Moving around, swallowing and breathing get increasingly difficult, and treatments like a feeding tube or breathing air through a face mask may be needed.
The condition eventually leads to death, but how long it takes to reach this stage varies a lot.
A few people live for many years or even decades with motor neurone disease.
You might prefer not to know how long you might live. Speak to a GP or your care team if you want to find out more."
More information and support,"Having motor neurone disease can be very challenging for you, your friends and your family.
Speak to a GP or your care team if you're struggling to cope and need more support.

How you get mpox,"Mpox can be passed on from person to person through:
any close physical contact with mpox blisters or scabs (including during sexual contact, kissing, cuddling or holding hands)
touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with mpox
the coughs or sneezes of a person with mpox when they're close to you
In parts of west and central Africa, mpox can also be caught from infected rodents (such as rats, mice and squirrels) if:
you're bitten
you touch their fur, skin, blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs
you eat their meat and it has not been cooked thoroughly"
Symptoms of mpox,"If you get infected with mpox, it usually takes between 5 and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear.
The first symptoms of mpox include:
a high temperature
a headache
muscle aches
backache
swollen glands
shivering (chills)
exhaustion
joint pain
A rash usually appears 1 to 5 days after the first symptoms. The rash often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body. This can include the mouth, genitals and anus.
You may also have anal pain or bleeding from your bottom.
The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox. It starts as raised spots, which turn into small blisters filled with fluid. These blisters eventually form scabs which later fall off.
The symptoms usually clear up in a few weeks. While you have symptoms, you can pass mpox on to other people."
Treatment for mpox,"Mpox is usually mild and most people recover within a few weeks without treatment.
But if your symptoms are more severe and you become unwell, you may need treatment in hospital.
The risk of needing treatment in hospital is higher for:
older people
young children
people with a condition or who are taking a medicine that affects their immune system
Because the infection can be passed on through close contact, it's important to isolate if you're diagnosed with it.
You may be asked to isolate at home if your symptoms are mild."
Vaccination to protect against mpox,"Mpox is caused by a similar virus to smallpox. The smallpox (MVA) vaccine should give a good level of protection against mpox.
Who can get mpox vaccination
The NHS is offering the smallpox (MVA) vaccine to people who are most likely to be exposed to mpox.
People who are most likely to be exposed include:
healthcare workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected mpox
men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men, and who have multiple partners, participate in group sex or attend sex-on-premises venues (staff at these venues are also eligible)
people who've been in close contact with someone who has mpox – ideally, they should have 1 dose of the vaccine within 4 days of contact, but it can be given up to 14 days after
Healthcare workers will usually be offered 2 doses of the vaccine.
Men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men will be offered 2 doses of the vaccine. The 2nd dose will be offered from 2 to 3 months after the 1st dose.
Your local NHS services will contact you when you can get your 2nd dose.
Important:
Changes to mpox vaccination
The NHS mpox outbreak vaccination programme ended in July 2023. But it is still available in London and Greater Manchester to eligible people who:
live in London or Greater Manchester
regularly travel to London or Greater Manchester to have sex
regularly travel to other countries to have sex
How to get mpox vaccination
Your local NHS services may contact you and offer you a vaccine if you're at risk of exposure.
You may also be offered the vaccine alongside other appointments, such as for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
If you're gay, bisexual or a man who has sex with other men, you can also get the smallpox vaccine from a vaccination site.
Find an mpox vaccination site
If none of the mpox vaccination sites are open or suitable for you, contact a sexual health clinic."
Things you can do to avoid getting and passing on mpox,"Although mpox is rare, there are things you can do to reduce your chance of getting it and passing it on.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser
talk to sexual partners about their sexual health and any symptoms they may have
be aware of the symptoms of mpox if you're sexually active, especially if you have new sexual partners
take a break from sex and intimate contact if you have symptoms of mpox until you're seen by a doctor and are told you cannot pass it on
Don’t
do not share bedding or towels with people who may have mpox
do not have close contact (within 1 metre) with people who may have mpox
do not go near wild or stray animals, including animals that appear unwell or are dead, while travelling in west and central Africa
do not eat or touch meat from wild animals while travelling in west and central Africa"

What happens during an MRI scan?,"During an MRI scan, you lie on a flat bed that's moved into the scanner.
Depending on the part of your body being scanned, you'll be moved into the scanner either head first or feet first.
Credit:
The MRI scanner is operated by a radiographer, who is trained in carrying out imaging investigations.
They control the scanner using a computer, which is in a different room, to keep it away from the magnetic field generated by the scanner.
You'll be able to talk to the radiographer through an intercom and they'll be able to see you on a television monitor and through the viewing window throughout the scan.
At certain times during the scan, the scanner will make loud tapping noises. This is the electric current in the scanner coils being turned on and off.
You'll be given earplugs or headphones to wear.
It's very important to keep as still as possible during your MRI scan.
The radiographer may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds or follow other instructions during the scan.
The scan lasts 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken.
Read more about how an MRI scan is performed."
How does an MRI scan work?,"Most of the human body is made up of water molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
At the centre of each hydrogen atom is an even smaller particle called a proton. Protons are like tiny magnets and are very sensitive to magnetic fields.
When you lie under the powerful scanner magnets, the protons in your body line up in the same direction, in the same way that a magnet can pull the needle of a compass. You will not be able to feel this.
Short bursts of radio waves are then sent to certain areas of the body, knocking the protons out of alignment.
When the radio waves are turned off, the protons realign. This sends out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers.
These signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body.
They also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals.
In the same way that millions of pixels on a computer screen can create complex pictures, the signals from the millions of protons in the body are combined to create a detailed image of the inside of the body."
Safety,"An MRI scan is a painless and safe procedure. You may find it uncomfortable if you have claustrophobia, but most people are able to manage it with support from the radiographer.
Most modern MRI scanners have a wider tunnel, which can help reduce claustrophobia. Going into the scanner feet first may be easier, although this isn't always possible.
Extensive research has been carried out into whether the magnetic fields and radio waves used during MRI scans could pose a risk to the human body.
No evidence has been found to suggest there's a risk, which means MRI scans are one of the safest medical procedures available.
But MRI scans may not be recommended in certain situations. For example, if you have a metal implant fitted, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint, you may not be able to have an MRI scan.
If you're pregnant, a doctor will discuss with you whether an MRI scan is suitable for you.
Read more about who can and can't have an MRI scan."
Symptoms of MRSA,"Most people with MRSA bacteria on their skin do not have any symptoms.
But if you get an MRSA infection under your skin, you may have an area of skin that:
is painful and swollen
feels warm when you touch it
leaks pus or liquid
looks red – though this may be harder to see on brown or black skin
If the infection spreads to your blood or lungs, or another part of your body, symptoms may include:
high temperature
difficulty breathing
chills
dizziness
confusion"
Treatments for MRSA,"MRSA can be treated with antibiotics.
Antibiotic tablets can be used for mild MRSA infections.
More serious infections may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given by injection or a drip into a vein in your arm.
You may need antibiotics for a few days or up to a few months, depending on how serious the infection is.
If you get complications, you may need further treatment, such as surgery to drain a build-up of pus (abscess)."
Preventing MRSA infections,"People staying in care homes and hospitals (especially those having surgery) are at a higher risk of getting an MRSA infection.
If you're visiting someone in a care home or hospital, follow any instructions you're given about washing or sanitising your hands.
Testing for MRSA before going into hospital
If you're due to have surgery, you may be offered a screening test for MRSA before you go into hospital.
This usually involves wiping swabs (similar to cotton buds) on:
the inside of your nostril
the back of your mouth
your groin
The swabs are then sent for testing.
If the result shows you have MRSA on your skin, you’ll need to treat it with a special nasal cream or spray, body wash and shampoo for around 5 to 10 days.
You will be sent these items along with instructions on how to use them."
Causes of MRSA infection,"MRSA usually lives harmlessly on the skin and mainly spreads through touch.
This can happen if you touch a person with MRSA, or something they’ve touched.
MRSA will only cause an infection if it spreads inside the body.
MRSA infections can affect anyone, but you may be more at risk if you:
have long stays in hospital (especially if you’re being treated for a serious condition)
have a break or opening in your skin, for example for a drip into a vein, a cut from surgery, a serious burn or wound, or other damage to your skin
have a weakened immune system (for example, because of a condition such as HIV or treatment such as chemotherapy)"
Symptoms of mucositis,"Mucositis affects the mouth and gut (digestive system).
Mucositis in your mouth
The symptoms of mucositis in your mouth usually begin around a week after starting chemotherapy, or about 2 weeks after starting radiotherapy.
Symptoms of oral mucositis include:
a dry mouth
a sore mouth, which can make eating and drinking painful
mouth ulcers
bad breath
a fungal mouth infection (oral thrush)
How severe your symptoms are will depend on the type of treatment you’re having.
Mucositis in your gut
The symptoms of mucositis in your gut usually begin around 2 weeks after starting chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Symptoms of mucositis in your gut include:
diarrhoea
sores (ulcers) around your bottom
bleeding from your gut (you may have blood in your poo)
pain when swallowing
constipation
stomach cramps and bloating"
Things you can do to help ease mucositis,"There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms of mucositis while you’re having chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Do
brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush at least twice a day – gently clean between your teeth using floss once a day if you can
rinse your mouth with warm water, salt water, or mild alcohol-free mouthwash several times a day
chew sugar-free gum or suck ice cubes, crushed ice or ice lollies if your mouth is dry
eat soft, moist foods, like soup, jelly or soft fruit
use lip balm to stop your lips getting dry
leave out dentures if you wear them, and keep them clean and moist even when you're not wearing them
drink plenty of water, eat less fibre and take diarrhoea medicine as advised by a doctor or pharmacist (if you have diarrhoea)
Don’t
do not smoke
do not use alcohol-based mouthwashes
do not eat hot food
do not eat spicy, acidic, rough or hard foods like crisps and crusty bread
do not drink hot, fizzy or alcoholic drinks
How to rinse with salt water"
Treatments for mucositis,"If you have mucositis in your mouth, treatments your care team may offer include:
painkillers, which may be tablets, mouthwashes, gels or sprays
mouthwashes that clean, numb and protect your mouth
sprays or gels to keep your mouth moist (saliva substitutes)
If you have mucositis in your gut, the treatments recommended will depend on your symptoms and how severe they are.
For example, you may be given medicines to:
relax your gut if you have stomach cramps or bloating
ease pain and reduce stomach acid
stop diarrhoea or reduce soreness inside your bottom (rectum)
Low-level laser therapy
There’s also a treatment for oral mucositis called low-level laser therapy.
A small probe that produces infra-red light is either put inside your mouth or outside your mouth, close to your cheek. The light can help prevent and treat mucositis.
The treatment can be given before and during a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Each session lasts 20 to 30 minutes."
Talking to others can help,"If you have side effects from cancer treatment, like mucositis, you may find it helps to talk to people in a similar situation.
Ask your care team about support groups in your area.
Some cancer charities also have online forums that you may find helpful."
Symptoms of multiple myeloma,"In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.
Eventually, myeloma causes a wide range of problems, including:
a persistent bone pain, usually in the back, ribs or hips
tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath – caused by anaemia
high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) – which may cause symptoms including extreme thirst, stomach pain, needing to pee frequently, constipation or confusion
weight loss
blurred vision, dizziness or headaches – caused by thickened blood (hyperviscosity)
repeated infections
bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods
weak bones that break (fracture) easily – if this affects the spine, it might cause symptoms such as pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and problems controlling your bladder and bowels, which requires emergency investigation
kidney problems
Myeloma doesn't usually cause a lump or tumour. Instead, it damages the bones and affects the production of healthy blood cells.
Read more about the symptoms of multiple myeloma."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis.
Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection and any other symptoms that suggest you might have myeloma. They may also arrange blood and urine tests.
If myeloma is suspected, you'll be referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment.
Read more about diagnosing multiple myeloma."
Causes of multiple myeloma,"It's not known exactly what causes multiple myeloma. However, there is a close link between multiple myeloma and a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).
MGUS is where there is an excess of protein molecules, called immunoglobulins, in your blood. This doesn't cause any symptoms and doesn't need treatment.
Every year, around 1 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma.
There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so people with MGUS will have regular tests to check for cancer.
Multiple myeloma is also more common in:
men
adults over 60 – most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare
black people – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations than white and Asian populations
people with a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma"
Treatment for multiple myeloma,"Treatment can often help to control the condition for several years, but most cases of multiple myeloma can't be cured. Research is ongoing to try to find new treatments.
Treatment for multiple myeloma usually includes:
anti-myeloma medicines to destroy the myeloma cells or control the cancer when it comes back (relapses)
medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma – such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia
As part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma.
Read more about treating multiple myeloma."
Support groups for multiple myeloma,"If you've been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may want to contact a local or national support group, such as Myeloma UK.
Your local haematology team will be able to direct you to helpful resources.
Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences.

Symptoms of multiple sclerosis,"The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress)."
Getting medical advice,"See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.
Find out more about diagnosing MS"
Types of multiple sclerosis,"MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise."
What causes multiple sclerosis?,"MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved."
Treatments for multiple sclerosis,"There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of inactive progressive MS, with no relapses or MRI activity.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched."
Living with multiple sclerosis,"If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.
Read more advice about living with MS"
Outlook,"MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time."
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis,"There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS."
Symptoms of multiple system atrophy (MSA),"Symptoms of MSA usually start when someone is between 50 and 60 years of age, but they can begin at any time after 30.
The symptoms are wide-ranging and include muscle control problems, similar to those of Parkinson's disease.
Many different functions of the body can be affected, including the urinary system, blood pressure control and muscle movement.
Although there are many different possible symptoms of MSA, not everyone who's affected will have all of them.
Bladder problems
Men and women with MSA will usually have one or more of the following bladder symptoms:
constantly feeling the need to pee
peeing more frequently
loss of bladder control
unable to empty the bladder properly
unable to pee
Erection problems
Men with MSA will usually have erectile dysfunction (the inability to get and maintain an erection), although this is a common problem that many men without the condition develop.
Low blood pressure when standing up 
Someone with MSA will often feel lightheaded, dizzy and faint after standing up. This is known as postural hypotension and is caused by a drop in blood pressure when you stand up or suddenly change position.
When you stand up after lying down, your blood vessels usually narrow quickly and your heart rate increases slightly to prevent your blood pressure from dropping and decreasing blood flow to your brain.
This function is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. But with MSA, this system does not work properly, so the control is lost.
Problems with co-ordination, balance and speech
In MSA, a part of the brain called the cerebellum is damaged. This can make the person clumsy and unsteady when walking, and can also cause slurred speech.
These problems are collectively known as cerebellar ataxia.
Slowness of movement and feeling stiff 
A person with MSA has much slower movements than normal (bradykinesia). This can make it difficult to carry out everyday tasks. Movement is hard to initiate, and the person will often have a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps. 
Some people may also have stiff and tense muscles. This can make it even more difficult to move around and cause painful muscle cramps (dystonia).
These symptoms are typical of Parkinson's disease but, unfortunately, the medicine used to relieve them in people with Parkinson's disease (levodopa) is not very effective for people with MSA.
Other signs and symptoms
People with MSA may also have:
shoulder pain and neck pain
constipation
cold hands and feet
problems controlling sweating
muscle weakness in the body and limbs – it may be more pronounced in one arm or leg
uncontrollable laughing or crying
sleep problems – insomnia, snoring, restless legs or nightmares
noisy breathing and unintentional sighing
a weak, quiet voice
swallowing problems
blurred vision
depression
dementia (although this is uncommon)"
Causes of multiple system atrophy (MSA),"The causes of MSA are not well understood.
It does not appear to be inherited – there's no evidence that an affected person's children will develop it.
Research is looking at whether family history and the environment play a role in your chances of getting MSA.
The brain cells of a person with MSA contain a protein called alpha-synuclein. A build-up of abnormal alpha-synuclein is thought to be responsible for damaging areas of the brain that control balance, movement and the body's normal functions."
Diagnosing multiple system atrophy (MSA),"There's no specific test to diagnose MSA.
A diagnosis can usually be made based on the symptoms, although it can potentially be confused with Parkinson's disease.
MSA or Parkinson's disease?
A person is more likely to have MSA rather than Parkinson's disease if:
their symptoms have progressed rapidly
they've had falls in the early stages of the condition
they do not respond well to the medicine levodopa
their speech is severely affected
they gasp and breathe noisily
Further tests
If MSA is suspected, a doctor (usually a neurologist) will test the person's reflexes and normal bodily functions, such as their bladder function and blood pressure.
A brain scan, usually an MRI scan, is often needed to detect any loss of brain cells."
Treating multiple system atrophy (MSA),"There's currently no cure for MSA and no way of slowing its progression. 
People with the condition typically live for 6 to 9 years after their symptoms start and may get worse quickly during this time. Some people may live for more than 10 years after being diagnosed.
The symptoms can be managed so that the person is as independent and comfortable as possible.
Find out how to manage:
low blood pressure
constipation
urinary incontinence
swallowing problems
Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can help people with MSA stay mobile and maintain their fitness and muscle strength."
Help and support,"Help for carers
Practical and financial help is available if you care for someone with MSA.
Your local authority can carry out a carer's assessment to assess your needs and determine the help and support you're entitled to.
Find out more about carer's assessments.
Support for people with multiple system atrophy (MSA)
If you have MSA and are finding coping with day-to-day life difficult, your doctor or nurse can refer you to a social worker.
They can carry out an assessment and recommend the help you need. For example, you may need:
care attendants – who can help with everyday tasks such as housework, dressing and washing
meals on wheels – your local council may be able to offer financial help for this; check your eligibility for getting meals at home
benefits – you may be eligible for a number of benefits, such as Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
home adaptations – to make moving around at home easier and ensure your home environment is as comfortable as possible
Find out more about care and support needs assessments. 
Further information and support

Symptoms of mumps,"Mumps is most recognisable by the painful swellings in the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive ""hamster face"" appearance.
Credit:
Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain, and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands."
When to see a GP,"It's important to contact a GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. 
While mumps is not usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.
Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal.
Let your GP know in advance if you're coming to the surgery so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection.
If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection team (HPT). The HPT will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.
Find your local health protection team on GOV.UK"
How mumps is spread,"Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.
A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.
During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated.
If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by:
regularly washing your hands with soap
using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze
avoiding school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop"
Preventing mumps,"You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined MMR vaccine for mumps, measles and rubella.
The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. 
Your child should be given 1 dose when they're around 12 to 13 months and a second booster dose at 3 years and 4 months.
Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides around 88% protection against mumps.
Anyone who did not have both doses of the MMR vaccine as a child can contact a GP to arrange to be vaccinated."
Treatment for mumps,"There's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within 1 or 2 weeks.
Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes:
getting plenty of bed rest and fluids
using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin should not be given to children under 16
applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain"
Complications,"Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health. Serious complications are rare.
But mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain.
Other complications include swelling of the testicles or ovaries (if the affected person has gone through puberty).
Find out more about the complications of mumps"
Who's affected,"Most cases of mumps occur in younger adults who did not receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule and did not have mumps as a child. 
Older adults who were born in the UK before the vaccine was introduced are likely to have had mumps as a child. Once you have been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection.
The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988. Adults born between 1980 and 1990 may not have been vaccinated as children, and are less likely than older adults to have had mumps as a child.
Mumps is currently most common among people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s who missed out on the MMR vaccine as children."
What causes muscular dystrophy?,"MD is caused by changes (mutations) in the genes responsible for the structure and functioning of a person's muscles.
The mutations cause changes in the muscle fibres that interfere with the muscles' ability to function. Over time, this causes increasing disability.
The mutations are often inherited from a person's parents. If you have a family history of MD, your GP may refer you for genetic testing and counselling to evaluate your risk of developing the condition or having a child with MD and to discuss the options available to you.
Read more about the causes of MD and genetic testing for MD."
Types of muscular dystrophy,"There are many different types of MD, each with somewhat different symptoms. Not all types cause severe disability and many don't affect life expectancy.
Some of the more common types of MD include:
Duchenne MD – one of the most common and severe forms, it usually affects boys in early childhood; people with the condition will usually only live into their 20s or 30s
myotonic dystrophy – a type of MD that can develop at any age; life expectancy isn't always affected, but people with a severe form of myotonic dystrophy may have shortened lives
facioscapulohumeral MD – a type of MD that can develop in childhood or adulthood; it progresses slowly and isn't usually life-threatening
Becker MD – closely related to Duchenne MD, but it develops later in childhood and is less severe; life expectancy isn't usually affected as much
limb-girdle MD – a group of conditions that usually develop in late childhood or early adulthood; some variants can progress quickly and be life-threatening, whereas others develop slowly
oculopharyngeal MD – a type of MD that doesn't usually develop until a person is between 50 and 60 years old, and doesn't tend to affect life expectancy
Emery-Dreifuss MD – a type of MD that develops in childhood or early adulthood; most people with this condition will live until at least middle age

Who's affected by muscular dystrophy?,"In the UK, around 70,000 people have MD or a related condition.
Duchenne MD is the most common type of MD. In the UK, about 100 boys are born with Duchenne MD each year, and there are about 2,500 people living with the condition in the UK at any one time.
Myotonic MD is the second most common type of MD, affecting around 1 person in every 8,000. 
Facioscapulohumeral MD is thought to affect around 1 in every 20,000 people in the UK, making it the third most common MD."
Diagnosing muscular dystrophy,"Many different methods can be used to diagnose the various types of MD. The age at which the condition is diagnosed will vary depending on when symptoms first start to appear.
Diagnosis will involve some or all of the following stages:
investigating any symptoms
discussing any family history of MD
physical examination
blood tests
electrical tests on the nerves and muscles
a muscle biopsy (where a small tissue sample is removed for testing)
See a GP if you or your child has any symptoms of MD. If necessary, they may refer you to a hospital for further tests."
Treating muscular dystrophy,"There's no cure for MD, but a range of treatments can help with the physical disabilities and problems that may develop. These can include:
mobility assistance – including exercise, physiotherapy and physical aids
support groups – to deal with the practical and emotional impact of MD
surgery – to correct postural deformities, such as scoliosis
medicine – such as steroids to improve muscle strength, or ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to treat heart problems
New research is looking into ways of repairing the genetic mutations and damaged muscles associated with MD.
Muscular Dystrophy UK has more information about research being carried out to help find effective treatments for MD
Read more about treating MD."
Support groups,"MD can affect you emotionally, as well as physically. Support groups and organisations may help you understand and come to terms with your condition. They can also provide useful advice and support for those who care for people with MD.
There are several national charities that offer support for people affected by MD, such as the Muscle Help Foundation and Muscular Dystrophy UK. Ask your GP or other healthcare professionals treating you about local support groups.
There are also some national support groups that promote research or provide support for specific types of MD, such as Action Duchenne, Duchenne UK and the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have MD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat MD. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of myasthenia gravis,"Common symptoms of myasthenia gravis include:
droopy eyelids
double vision
difficulty making facial expressions
problems chewing and difficulty swallowing
slurred speech
weak arms, legs or neck
shortness of breath and occasionally serious breathing difficulties
The symptoms tend to get worse when you're tired. Many people find they're worse towards the end of the day, and better the next morning after getting some sleep.
Read more about the symptoms of myasthenia gravis."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have long-lasting or worrying symptoms that could be caused by myasthenia gravis.
They'll ask about your symptoms and medical history.
The GP may refer you to a specialist for tests to help diagnose myasthenia gravis or look for other possible causes of your symptoms.
Tests you may have include a blood test, a test to see how well your nerves are working, and some scans, such as a CT scan or MRI scan.
Read more about tests for myasthenia gravis."
Treatments for myasthenia gravis,"Treatments to help keep the symptoms of myasthenia gravis under control include:
avoiding anything that triggers the symptoms – some people find that things such as tiredness and stress make their symptoms worse
medicine to help improve muscle weakness
surgery to remove the thymus gland (a small gland in the chest linked to myasthenia gravis)
If the symptoms suddenly get worse – for example, you develop severe breathing or swallowing difficulties – you may need urgent treatment in hospital.
Read more about how myasthenia gravis is treated."
Outlook for myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis is a long-term condition that typically has phases when it improves and phases when it gets worse.
It usually affects most of the body, spreading from the eyes and face to other areas over weeks, months or years. But for some people with myasthenia gravis only the eyes are affected.
It is common for people to have ""flare-ups"", where symptoms are very troublesome, followed by periods of remission, where symptoms improve.
While remission can sometimes be permanent, this is rare in cases of myasthenia gravis.
If severe, myasthenia gravis can be life-threatening, but it does not have a significant impact on life expectancy for most people."
Cause of myasthenia gravis ,"Myasthenia gravis is caused by a problem with the signals sent between the nerves and the muscles.
It's an autoimmune condition, which means it's the result of the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection) mistakenly attacking a healthy part of the body.
In myasthenia gravis, the immune system damages the communication system between the nerves and muscles, making the muscles weak and easily tired.
It's not clear why this happens, but it's been linked to issues with the thymus gland (a gland in the chest that's part of the immune system).
Many people with myasthenia gravis have a thymus gland that's larger than normal. Around 1 in 10 people have an abnormal growth of the thymus called a thymoma."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have myasthenia gravis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat myasthenia gravis. You can opt out of the register at any time."
What happens in MDS?,"Normally, the spongy tissue found inside bones (bone marrow) produces:
red blood cells to carry oxygen around your body
white blood cells to help fight infection
platelets to help your blood clot
But in MDS, your bone marrow doesn't make enough of these healthy blood cells. Instead, it makes abnormal cells that aren't fully developed (immature).
As the condition progress, your bone marrow gets gradually taken over by the immature blood cells, which don't work properly.
They squeeze out the healthy ones, making the number of cells that manage to get into the bloodstream lower and lower.
The condition can develop slowly (indolent) or quickly (aggressive), and in some people it can develop into a type of leukaemia called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)."
Main types of MDS,"MDS can affect just one type of blood cell or many, depending on the type of MDS you have.
Until 2016, the types of MDS were called:
refractory anaemia – where you don't have enough red blood cells
refractory cytopenia – where you don't have enough red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets
refractory anaemia with excess blasts – where you don't have enough red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets, and have a higher risk of developing AML
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the terms to:
MDS with single lineage dysplasia (replacing refractory anaemia)
MDS with multilineage dysplasia (replacing refractory cytopenia)
MDS with excess blasts (replacing refractory anaemia with excess blasts)
There are other types of MDS, and your doctor may also talk to you about the ""risk group"" of your MDS. This refers to how likely it is that your MDS might develop into AML.
Find more information on the types and risk groups of MDS:
Macmillan Cancer Support: blood cancer
MDS UK Patient Support Group: What is MDS?"
Symptoms of MDS,"The symptoms you have will depend on the type of MDS. For most people, symptoms are mild at first and slowly get worse.
They can include:
weakness, tiredness and occasional breathlessness (because of the low number of red blood cells)
frequent infections (because of the low number of white blood cells)
bruising and easy bleeding, such as nosebleeds (because of the low number of platelets)
If you have any of these symptoms, you should speak to your GP about them.
Some people with MDS don't have any symptoms. They may find out they have MDS after having blood tests for something else."
Risk of development into leukaemia,"Some people with MDS go on to develop acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is cancer of the white blood cells.
This is known as ""transformation"". It can take a few months or up to several years before transformation takes place.
The risk of this happening depends on what kind of MDS you have, and the number of normal and abnormal blood cells you have.
Ask your doctor about your risk of developing AML."
Treatments for MDS,"The type of treatment you get will depend on the type of MDS you have, your risk of developing AML, and whether you have any other health conditions.
The aim of treatment is to get the number and type of blood cells in your bloodstream back to normal and manage your symptoms.
If your MDS has only a low risk of transforming into cancer, you may not need any treatment at first and may just be monitored with regular blood tests.
Treating your symptoms (supportive treatment)
Symptoms of MDS can often be controlled with a combination of the following treatments:
injections of growth factor medicines, such as erythropoietin or G-CSF – to increase the number of healthy red or white blood cells
a blood transfusion – of either red blood cells or platelets, depending on which you need
medicine to get rid of the excess iron in your blood – which can build up after a lot of blood transfusions
antibiotics to treat infections – if your white blood cell count is low
Lenalidomide
The medicine lenalidomide can be used to treat a rare type of MDS called deletion 5q, or del(5q).
People with del(5q) can have severe anaemia (a lack of red blood cells), which requires regular blood transfusions.
Lenalidomide is a type of treatment known as a biological therapy. It's swallowed as a capsule and affects the way your immune system works.
Azacitidine
Azacitidine is type of medicine known as a hypomethylating agent, which is injected under the skin.
It's sometimes offered to people with more serious types of MDS, and may improve blood production and slow down the progress of MDS.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is sometimes given if you have a type of MDS that increases your risk of AML.
It involves taking medicines that destroy the immature blood cells by stopping them growing. It's taken either as a tablet or an injection.
Your chemotherapy treatment will probably be similar to that used for AML.
Find out more about how AML is treated
Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressant medicines, such as anti-thymocyte globulins (ATGs) and ciclosporin, can be used to suppress the immune system and can sometimes help improve blood count.
Stem cell (bone marrow) transplant
A stem cell transplant (also called a bone marrow transplant) is given after chemotherapy.
It involves replacing your abnormal blood cells with healthy cells from a donor. The healthy blood cells are fed into your bloodstream through a drip.
It can sometimes cure MDS, but isn't suitable for everyone.
A stem cell transplant will generally only be offered if you're young and otherwise in reasonably good health, as it's a very intensive treatment.
It helps if you have a suitable donor in your family (a close relative, such as a brother or sister). But it's sometimes possible to have a stem cell transplant using an unrelated donor whose tissue type closely matches yours.
Find out more about having a stem cell transplant"
Causes of MDS,"The cause of MDS is not usually known. This is called primary MDS.
Rarely, MDS can be caused by chemotherapy. This is known as secondary MDS, or treatment-related MDS.
MDS doesn't normally run in families, but some rare types occasionally do."
Diagnosis of MDS,"MDS is diagnosed by carrying out blood tests and bone marrow tests.
The blood tests will show how many normal and abnormal blood cells you have.
A bone marrow test involves taking a sample of your bone marrow, usually from your hip bone, under local anaesthetic.
The doctor passes a needle through your skin and into your bone, drawing out a sample of your bone marrow into a syringe. This will be sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.
The bone marrow test takes 15 to 20 minutes and can be done on the ward or in the outpatients department.
Find out more about bone marrow tests on Cancer Research UK"
Further support,"Having MDS may have a significant impact on your life, both emotionally and physically.
There are organisations that offer support and information to people diagnosed and living with MDS, including:
MDS UK Patient Support Group
MDS Foundation: global patient support groups
Blood Cancer UK: support for you
Leukaemia Care: support and information
Macmillan Cancer Support: cancer information and support
Cancer Research UK: coping with cancer"
Clinical trials,"The treatment of MDS is constantly evolving and new medicines are being tested all the time.
You may be offered the chance to take part in a clinical trial.

Signs of short-sightedness,"Short-sightedness usually starts in children from age 6 to 13. It can also happen in adults.
Signs you or your child may be short-sighted include:
difficulty reading words from a distance, such as reading the whiteboard at school
sitting close to the TV or computer, or holding a mobile phone or tablet close to the face
getting headaches
rubbing the eyes a lot
Short-sightedness often runs in families, so you may have relatives who are also short-sighted.
It can get worse until the eye has stopped growing, at around 20 years of age."
What happens during an eye test,"To check if you or your child is short-sighted, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test.
You'll be asked to look at a light or read letters on a chart while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes.
To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given special eyedrops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly.
If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician."
Treatments for short-sightedness,"Short-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses.
These help your eyes focus correctly, so you can see distant objects more clearly.
Glasses are suitable for children and adults. Contact lenses are only suitable for adults and some children
An optician will advise you about the best option for your short-sightedness."
How to stop short-sightedness getting worse,"It's not clear why short-sightedness happens and it's hard to prevent it.
But there are some things that can help stop it getting worse.
These include:
spending more time outdoors (especially children)
wearing bi-focal or multi-focal contact lenses
Some opticians may advise wearing a special lens overnight (orthokeratology). This can help you see better without glasses or contact lenses.
If you're worried about your or your child's eyesight getting worse, talk to an optician."
Complications of short-sightedness,"Young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to get other conditions, such as:
a squint – where the eyes point in different directions
a lazy eye – where sight in 1 eye does not develop properly
Some adults with severe short sight-sightedness are more likely to develop:
glaucoma – increased pressure inside the eyes
detached retina – where the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose; this needs urgent treatment to prevent losing your sight
cataracts – cloudy patches inside the lens of the eye"
Check if it's myositis,"The main symptom of myositis is muscle weakness, which can start very gradually and cause you to trip or fall over a lot.
You may also find it difficult to do things like:
get up from a chair
climb stairs
lift objects, such as a cup of tea
comb your hair
There are different types of myositis. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are the most common.
Depending on the type, other symptoms can include:
painful or aching muscles
feeling very tired
weight loss
night sweats
a patchy, red rash, usually on the eyelids, face, neck and the backs of the hands – this can look different on brown or black skin
problems with swallowing (dysphagia) or breathing
There may be times when your symptoms are better than at other times."
What happens at your appointment,"If a GP thinks you have myositis, they will do a blood test and refer you to a specialist.
The specialist may do more tests, including:
blood tests
an MRI scan
an electromyography (EMG) scan to look at the electrical activity in your muscles
a biopsy to take samples of your muscle"
Causes of myositis,"It's not clear what causes myositis, but it may be passed on from your parents in your genes.
Most types of myositis are autoimmune conditions, where the body's immune system attacks itself, causing swelling of the muscles and joints."
Treatment for myositis,"It's not possible to cure myositis, but treatment can help control the symptoms.
Treatment usually includes:
medicines, such as steroids, to reduce swelling and stop your immune system attacking your body
physiotherapy to help you stay active and improve your muscle strength
If your myositis is severe or gets worse, you may be offered other treatments to stop your immune system's response.
These can include:
medicines, including some usually used to treat rheumatoid arthritis
immunoglobulin therapy, which uses antibodies (part of the immune system) taken from blood donations
You may also be offered speech and language therapy if you have difficulties swallowing or communicating."
Check if you have Ménière's disease,"Ménière's disease symptoms come and go.
When you get symptoms, they start suddenly and can last anywhere between a few minutes and 24 hours. Some people have symptoms more often than others.
Symptoms include:
feeling like you or everything around you is spinning (vertigo)
losing your balance
ringing or buzzing sounds in 1 or both ears (tinnitus)
hearing loss
feeling pressure, discomfort or pain deep inside your ear
feeling or being sick
Over time, your hearing may gradually get worse and you may get constant tinnitus."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of Ménière's disease, a GP will ask you about your symptoms, check inside your ears, and look at your head and neck.
They may also ask you to do some exercises, such as marching on the spot or standing with your heels together and your eyes closed.
If the GP thinks you have Ménière's disease, they'll refer you to a specialist for further tests, such as blood tests and an MRI scan."
Treatment for Ménière's disease,"There's no cure for Ménière's disease, but your symptoms can be managed with treatment.
Treatment includes:
medicines to help symptoms such as vertigo, feeling sick and being sick
hearing aids
help to manage your tinnitus, which can include different types of therapy
help to improve your balance (vestibular rehabilitation)
Rarely, you may be offered surgery on your inner ear if you're finding it difficult to manage your symptoms.
Ménière's disease can have an impact on your everyday life, which can affect your mental health.
Counselling and relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises, can help."
Things you can try to help with Ménière's disease,"Ménière's disease symptoms can come on suddenly and without warning.
There are some lifestyle changes you can make that may help manage the symptoms.
Do
keep your medicines with you at all times
consider the risks and take care if doing things like swimming, climbing ladders or using dangerous machinery
drink lots of fluids
talk to a GP about trying a low-salt diet
try to avoid caffeine in drinks such as tea and coffee and foods like chocolate
Don’t
do not drive if you feel dizzy or symptoms of vertigo are coming on
do not drink alcohol
do not smoke"
Symptoms of nail patella syndrome,"Almost everyone with nail patella syndrome has abnormal nails, and many people also have problems with their knee caps (patellae), elbows and pelvis.
Some of the problems will be obvious from birth, but others may not become apparent until later on.
There are several symptoms and problems associated with nail patella syndrome.
Nails
Nails may be missing, underdeveloped, discoloured, split, ridged or pitted.
Thumbnails are most severely affected, with each fingernail being less severely affected from the index finger to the little finger.
Toenails are usually less affected by the condition.
Kneecaps 
The kneecaps may be missing, small, irregularly shaped and easily dislocated, and can click, lock or may feel unstable or painful.
Arms and elbows 
Some people aren't able to fully extend their arms or turn their palms up while keeping their elbows straight. The elbows may also angle outwards, and dislocations can occur.
Pelvis 
Bony growths on the pelvic bone (visible on X-rays) are common, but don't usually cause problems.
Kidneys
There may be protein in the urine (an early sign of kidney problems), which can be accompanied by blood in the urine. This can sometimes progress to kidney disease.
Other symptoms
People with nail patella syndrome may also have:
increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) which can develop at an earlier age than usual
numbness, tingling or a burning sensation in the hands and feet
poor blood circulation in the hands and feet
constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
difficulty putting on weight, particularly muscle
thin bones (osteoporosis), particularly in the hips
a high forehead and hairline"
Causes of nail patella syndrome,"Nail patella syndrome is usually caused by a fault in a gene called LMX1B that's inherited from one parent.
But there isn't always a family history of nail patella syndrome. In some cases, an LMX1B gene mutation (alteration) occurs for the first time on its own."
Genetic testing,"Nail patella syndrome is usually diagnosed based on your or your child's symptoms. In most cases, a blood test to check for the faulty gene can confirm the diagnosis.
In about 5% of people diagnosed with nail patella syndrome, a fault in the LMX1B gene can't be found.
Having children
If you have nail patella syndrome, there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance that any child you have will be born with the condition.
If you're planning to have a baby, talk to your GP about getting a referral to a genetic counsellor. They can explain the risks and what your options are.
These may include:
having tests during pregnancy to see if your baby will be born with nail patella syndrome
trying pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)
PGD is similar to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), but the embryos are tested to check that they don't have the faulty gene before they're implanted in the womb.
Read more about PGD from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority"
Treatments for nail patella syndrome,"There's no cure for nail patella syndrome, but treatments are available to help manage the symptoms.
Kneecap and joint problems
If your kneecaps are easily dislocated and painful, painkillers, physiotherapy, splinting and bracing may help.
But the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided because they can affect the kidneys.
Some people may need corrective surgery for problems with the bones and joints. This should be carried out after an MRI scan by a surgeon who understands the condition.
Tests and treatment for kidney problems
Urine tests should be carried out at birth to check for kidney problems. High levels of protein in the urine may need to be treated with medication.
Later on, your urine and blood pressure should be tested every year.
Kidney problems may occur during (or be made worse by) pregnancy in women who have nail patella syndrome.
It's recommended that pregnant women with the condition have their blood pressure taken and urine tested frequently.
If your kidneys aren't working properly, you may need dialysis, where a machine is used to replicate many of the kidney's functions.
If you have severe kidney disease, you may need a kidney transplant.
Tests and treatment for glaucoma
Screening for glaucoma should start as soon as a child is able to co-operate with the examination.
Treatment for glaucoma may involve using eye drops or having a procedure to reduce the pressure inside the eye. 
Read more about testing for glaucoma and treating glaucoma.
Other tests
A dental examination should be carried out at least every 6 months.
An assessment of bone density is recommended for young adults to check for osteoporosis."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you or your child has nail patella syndrome, your clinical team may pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Your nails may change over time,"It's normal for nails to:
become thicker or break more easily (brittle) as you get older
become harder, softer or more brittle during pregnancy (they should be healthier within 6 months of having a baby)
change colour, become loose and eventually fall off after an injury
Fingernails that fall off after an injury should grow back within 6 months. Toenails can take up to 18 months."
Things you can do to look after your nails,"There are some things you can do to help with common nail problems.
Do
wear rubber gloves if your hands are often in water or you regularly use cleaning products
clean your nails with a soft nailbrush
apply hand cream to your nails and fingertips regularly
trim your nails regularly (it may help to cut them after a shower or bath)
cut injured, loose nails back to where they are still attached, so they do not bend or catch on objects
Don’t
do not cut your nails down the edges, and only trim straight across the top to help avoid an ingrown toenail
do not clean under your nails with sharp objects
do not wear shoes that pinch your toes, especially when exercising
do not bite or pick your nails or the skin around them
do not ignore fungal infections on your skin, such as athlete's foot"
Causes of nail problems,"Most nail problems are caused by:
injuries or biting your nails
staining your nails, for example, by smoking or applying a lot of nail varnish
not regularly trimming your nails, or cutting them at an angle
your hands often being in water or cleaning products
a fungal nail infection
Nail problems can sometimes be a symptom of a more serious or long-term condition, such as:
psoriasis
iron deficiency anaemia
an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid
diabetes
heart, lung or liver disease
Some medicines can also cause nail problems. Check the side effects of any medicine you're taking."
Check if your baby has nappy rash,"Symptoms of nappy rash can include:
red or raw patches on your baby’s bottom or the whole nappy area
skin that looks sore and feels hot to touch
scaly and dry skin
an itchy or painful bottom
your baby seeming uncomfortable or distressed
spots, pimples, or blisters on bottom (spots can appear red or brown, but may be less noticeable on brown and black skin)
Credit:"
Things you can do to help with nappy rash,"Nappy rash can be treated and prevented by following some simple advice.
Do
change wet or dirty nappies as soon as possible
keep the skin clean and dry – pat or rub the skin gently to dry it
leave nappies off when possible
use extra absorbent nappies
make sure your baby's nappies fit properly
clean your baby's skin with water or fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes
bath your baby daily (but not more than twice a day, as washing too much can make the skin dry out)
Don’t
do not use soaps, baby lotion or bubble bath as they can irritate the skin
do not use talcum powder or antiseptics on nappy rash
do not put nappies on too tightly as it can irritate the skin
A pharmacist can help with nappy rash
If the rash is causing your baby discomfort, a pharmacist can recommend a nappy rash cream or medicine to treat it at home.
They may suggest using a thin layer of a barrier cream to protect the skin or giving your baby child's paracetamol for pain relief (only suitable for babies over 2 months old).
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for nappy rash,"A GP may prescribe treatment if your baby is in a lot of discomfort or they think your baby might have an infection.
They may prescribe:
a steroid cream or ointment to help with redness and soreness
an antifungal cream, if they think your baby has a thrush infection
antibiotics, if they think your baby has a bacterial infection"
Causes of nappy rash,"It's normal for babies to sometimes get nappy rash.
It can be caused by:
your baby's skin being in contact with pee or poo for a long time
not cleaning the nappy area or changing the nappy often enough
the nappy rubbing against your baby's skin
an allergic reaction to soap, detergent or bubble bath
irritation from fragranced baby wipes or wipes containing alcohol
some types of medicines, such as antibiotics or laxatives (used to make a baby poo more often)
thrush (a fungal infection)"
What causes narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is often caused by a lack of the brain chemical hypocretin (also known as orexin), which regulates wakefulness.
The lack of hypocretin is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the cells that produce it or the receptors that allow it to work.
But this does not explain all cases of narcolepsy, and the exact cause of the problem is often unclear.
Things that have been suggested as possible triggers of narcolepsy include:
hormonal changes, which can occur during puberty or the menopause
major psychological stress
an infection, such as swine flu, or the medicine used to vaccinate against it (Pandemrix)
Find out more about the causes of narcolepsy."
Who's affected,"It's difficult to know exactly how many people have narcolepsy because many cases are thought to go unreported.
But it's estimated to affect about 30,000 people in the UK.
Men and women are thought to be affected equally by narcolepsy, although some studies have suggested the condition may be more common in men.
The symptoms of narcolepsy often begin during adolescence, although it's usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40."
Diagnosing narcolepsy,"See a GP if you think you may have narcolepsy. They may ask about your sleeping habits and any other symptoms you have.
They may also carry out tests to help rule out other conditions that could be causing your excessive daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnoea, restless legs in bed and kicking during sleep, or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).
If necessary, you'll be referred to a specialist in sleep disorders, who'll analyse your sleep patterns.
This will usually involve staying overnight in a specialist sleep centre so various aspects of your sleep can be monitored.
Find out more about diagnosing narcolepsy."
Treating narcolepsy,"There's currently no cure for narcolepsy, but making changes to improve your sleeping habits and taking medicine can help minimise the impact the condition has on your daily life.
Taking frequent, brief naps evenly spaced throughout the day is one of the best ways to manage excessive daytime drowsiness.
This may be difficult when you're at work or school, but a GP or specialist may be able to devise a sleep schedule that will help you get into a routine of taking naps.
Keeping to a strict bedtime routine can also help, so you should go to bed at the same time each night whenever possible.
If your symptoms are particularly troublesome, you may be prescribed medicine that can help reduce daytime sleepiness, prevent cataplexy attacks and improve your sleep at night.
These medicines are usually taken as daily tablets, capsules or drinkable solutions.
Find out more about treating narcolepsy."
Narcolepsy and driving,"If you're diagnosed with narcolepsy, it may affect your ability to drive.
Stop driving immediately and inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
You'll need to complete a medical questionnaire so your individual circumstances can be assessed.
You'll usually be allowed to drive again if your narcolepsy is well controlled and you have regular reviews to assess your condition.

Tell the DVLA about your condition at GOV.UK: Narcolepsy and driving"
Symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer,"The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are:
a blocked nose that does not go away and usually only affects 1 side
nosebleeds
a decreased sense of smell
mucus running from your nose – this can be bloody
mucus draining into the back of your nose and throat
These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis.
At a later stage, symptoms can include:
pain or numbness in the face, particularly in the upper cheek, that does not go away
swollen glands in the neck
partial loss of vision or double vision
a bulging eye
a watering eye that does not go away
pain or pressure in 1 ear
a persistent lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms.
It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but it's worth getting them checked out.
If a GP thinks you might need some tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, you'll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant at a hospital.
Diagnosing nasal and sinus cancer
Tests you may have to help diagnose nasal and sinus cancer include:
a nasal endoscopy (nasoendoscopy) – where a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera and light at the end is inserted into your nose to examine the area; this can be uncomfortable, so before the procedure you'll be asked whether you'd like anaesthetic sprayed on the back of your throat
a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined; this may be done during an endoscopy
a fine needle aspiration – where fluid and cells are taken from a lymph node using a needle to see if the cancer has spread
If you're diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer, you may have a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan or ultrasound scan to help stage and grade the cancer.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages and grades of different types of nasal and sinus cancer."
Risk groups for nasal and sinus cancer,"Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer.
These include:
prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work – including wood dust, leather dust, cloth fibres, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde
smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer
human papillomavirus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat"
Treatments for nasal and sinus cancer,"The treatment recommended for you will depend on several factors, including the stage at which the cancer was diagnosed, how far it's spread, and your general level of health.
Treatment may include:
surgery to remove a tumour – this can be performed through open surgery or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery)
radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small pieces of a tumour that may be left after surgery
chemotherapy – where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery
If you smoke, it's important that you give up.
Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause you to have more side effects from treatment.
Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who'll discuss the treatment options with you. 
A combination of treatments will often be recommended."
Outlook for nasal and sinus cancer,"There are many different types of cancer that can affect the nasal cavity and sinuses.
The outlook varies, depending on the specific type of nasal and sinus cancer you have, its exact location, how far it's spread before being diagnosed and treated, and your overall level of health and fitness.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the outlook for nasal and sinus cancer."
Help and support,"Being diagnosed with nasal and sinus cancer can be a shock and may be difficult to come to terms with. Everyone reacts differently.
Talking about how you feel with your family and friends can be a big help.
But if you're unable to talk with family or friends, other sources of help and support are available.
For example, Cancer Research UK has nurses you can speak to by calling 0808 800 4040 (freephone), 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

Check if you have nasal polyps,"Symptoms of nasal polyps include:
a blocked nose
a runny nose
a feeling that mucus is slowly dripping down the back of your throat (postnasal drip)
a reduced sense of smell or taste
snoring
Nasal polyps can sometimes feel like a cold. But colds tend to clear up within a few days, whereas nasal polyps will not get better unless they're treated.
If your polyps block your sinuses (the air pockets around your nose) you may also have symptoms of sinusitis."
Treatment for nasal polyps,"A GP should be able to tell if you have nasal polyps by looking inside your nose.
If you have nasal polyps, you'll usually be given steroid nose drops or a spray to shrink the polyps.
Sometimes, you may be given steroid tablets, usually for up to 2 weeks, to help relieve symptoms.
Make sure you follow the advice of the GP about how to use your medicine and how long to take it for.
Surgery to remove polyps
If there's no sign of improvement after about 12 weeks, the GP may suggest surgery to remove your polyps.
Most people who have surgery see an improvement, but it's common for polyps to grow back, usually within a few years.
Important
You may need to keep using a steroid nasal spray after surgery to stop the polyps returning quickly."
Things you can do if you have nasal polyps,"After seeing a GP for nasal polyps, a pharmacist can recommend:
steroid nasal sprays that do not need a GP prescription
salt water washes (called a saline rinse or nasal douche) to help unblock your nose
How to make your own salt water wash to help unblock your nose"
Causes of nasal polyps,"It's not clear what causes nasal polyps.
Certain things can increase your risk of getting nasal polyps, like:
asthma
an intolerance or sensitivity to aspirin
Nasal polyps are rare in children."
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer,"It's often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions.
Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:
a lump in the neck that doesn’t go away after 3 weeks
hearing loss (usually only in 1 ear)
tinnitus (hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source)
a blocked or stuffy nose (usually only blocked on 1 side)
nosebleeds
headaches
double vision
numbness in the bottom part of your face
swallowing problems
a hoarse voice
unintentional weight loss
See a GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if they haven't improved after 3 weeks.
It's very unlikely they'll be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, but it's best to get them checked out."
Causes of nasopharyngeal cancer,"The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
These include:
being of south Chinese or north African descent
having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish
coming into contact with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes glandular fever
having a job where you regularly come into contact with hardwood dust or a chemical called formaldehyde
having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who's had the condition
The human papilloma virus (HPV) is also thought to be a risk factor for developing nasopharyngeal cancer.
About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer, and the average age at diagnosis is about 50."
Diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer,"If you go to a GP with symptoms like those of nasopharyngeal cancer, they'll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.
This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light.
The GP will refer you to a head and neck cancer specialist (oncologist) if they think further tests are necessary.
At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions.
Some of the tests you may have include:
a nasendoscopy – a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is put in your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; you're usually conscious but local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat
imaging scans – MRI scans, CT scans or PET-CT scans can be used to look for tumours and check if the cancer has spread
a panendoscopy – a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together
a biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory
Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer.
They'll also be able to ""stage"" the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it's spread.
Read more about the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website"
How nasopharyngeal cancer is treated,"If you're diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you'll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together in a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case.
The 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are:
radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy – where medicine is used to kill cancer cells
A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is often used.
Surgery isn't usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer because it's difficult for surgeons to access the affected area.
If you smoke, it's important you give up. Smoking increases your risk of cancer returning and may cause more side effects from treatment.
Read about how to quit smoking.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.
It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.
Most of the time, external radiotherapy is used. A machine focuses high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.
In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.
It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This maximises the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.
Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.
External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends.
This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won't need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments.

Media last reviewed: 1 July 2021
Media review due: 1 July 2024
Sometimes, internal radiotherapy may be needed if nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment.
A radioactive source is put into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.
Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.
Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:
red and sore skin in the treatment area
feeling sick
changes to your sense of taste
dry mouth
hair loss
These side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you have these problems, as treatment is often available to help.
Read more about what happens during radiotherapy and the side effects of radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.
It's usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months.
You won't usually need to stay in hospital overnight during treatment.
Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as:
feeling sick
diarrhoea
sore mouth
tiredness
These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. 
You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins.
Read more about what happens during chemotherapy and the side effects of chemotherapy.
Follow-up
After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll become gradually less frequent over time."
Outlook,"The outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer depends on your age, general health and how advanced the condition is when you're diagnosed.
Radiotherapy can often cure very early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer. But it's sometimes diagnosed at a more advanced stage because it doesn't always cause obvious symptoms until later on.
More advanced cancers are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. They're often curable if the cancer hasn't spread beyond the head and neck region.
There aren't any UK survival statistics for nasopharyngeal cancer. In England, almost 75 out of every 100 people diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer will live for at least 1 year after diagnosis.
About 50 people out of 100 will live for 5 years or more after being diagnosed.

How well natural family planning works,"Effectiveness of fertility awareness method
When used correctly all the time, fertility awareness methods are between 91% and 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.
If you do not follow the instructions exactly, it is only 76% effective. This means 24 in 100 women will get pregnant when tracking their fertility for a year.
Effectiveness of lactational amenorrhea method
If you are breastfeeding and follow lactational amenorrhea method correctly all the time, it is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.
If you do not follow the instructions exactly, it’s 98% effective and 2 in 100 women will get pregnant again within 6 months of giving birth."
How to find out about natural family planning,"You need an expert such as a fertility awareness practitioner or a midwife to teach you about natural family planning.
You can find out about natural family planning from:
sexual health clinics, also called family planning or contraception clinics
some GP surgeries
some young people's services (call the national sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for more information)
You can find a fertility awareness practitioner on the Fertility UK website.
If you’re pregnant, you can talk to your midwife about breastfeeding and the lactational amenorrhoea method.
Find contraception information and advice services"
How natural family planning works,"There are different instructions for:
tracking your menstrual cycle to know when you're fertile (fertility awareness method)
breastfeeding a newborn baby to delay ovulation (lactational amenorrhoea method)
A healthcare professional specially trained in fertility awareness can teach you what you need to do every day for natural family planning to work.
Ask a midwife, or ask at a GP surgery or sexual health clinic to see if there’s someone available who can support you.
Using the fertility awareness method
With the fertility awareness method, you record the following every day:
your body temperature
details of your vaginal discharge
your menstrual cycle
By tracking these you can see the days when you’re most likely to get pregnant (most fertile) each month. On fertile days, use a condom or avoid having sex.
It can take 2 to 3 menstrual cycles to understand how to do this properly. Use additional contraception during this time, or do not have sex.
There are apps and fertility monitoring devices designed to help you track your fertile days, but none are officially recommended by the NHS.
Using the lactational amenorrhoea method
With the lactional amenorrhoea method, you need to breastfeed your baby:
at least every 4 hours during the day
at least every 6 hours during the night
This method only works for the first 6 months after giving birth and you need to start as soon as you have your baby.
It will not work if you have a period, or you give your baby formula milk or solid food.
If you express breastmilk it may not be as effective, but there’s very little research into this."
Can I use natural family planning?,"Natural family planning is not suitable for everyone.
It may be helpful if you cannot use other types of contraception because of a health condition.
Natural family planning may not be suitable for you if:
you have irregular periods (fertility awareness method)
you cannot breastfeed (lactational awareness method)
you need to avoid getting pregnant due to a health condition
you take a medicine that can affect your baby, such as some medicines for bipolar disorder, migraine and epilepsy
Speak to a doctor or nurse, or ask your midwife, if you want to know whether you can use natural family planning.
Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to a doctor first."

How you can ease neck pain yourself,"Do
take paracetamol or ibuprofen – or use ibuprofen gel on your neck
use a low, firm pillow
put heat or cold packs on your neck
try neck flexibility exercises
Don’t
do not wear a neck collar – it's better to keep your neck moving (unless a doctor tells you not to)
do not do anything that could be dangerous because you cannot move your neck – for example, driving or cycling
Putting heat or cold packs on your neck"
What can cause neck pain,"The most common causes of neck pain are:
the neck becoming locked in an awkward position while sleeping
bad posture – for example, when sitting at a desk for a long time
a pinched nerve
an injury – for example, whiplash from a traffic accident or fall"
How you can prevent neck pain,"Do
when sleeping, make sure your head is the same height as the rest of your body
have a firm mattress
sit upright – roll your shoulders back gently and bring your neck back
Don’t
do not keep your neck in the same position for a long time – for example, when sitting at a desk
do not sleep on your front
do not twist your neck when you're in bed"
Check if you have necrotising fasciitis,"Symptoms of necrotising fasciitis can develop quickly within hours or over a few days.
At first you may have:
intense pain or loss of feeling near to a cut or wound – the pain may seem much worse than you would usually expect from a cut or wound
swelling of the skin around the affected area
flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headache and tiredness
Later symptoms can include:
being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea
confusion
black, purple or grey blotches and blisters on the skin (these may be less obvious on black or brown skin)
Information:
Necrotising fasciitis is very rare. The symptoms are similar to more common skin infections like cellulitis."
Treatments for necrotising fasciitis,"Necrotising fasciitis gets worse quickly and can be fatal. It must be treated in hospital as soon as possible.
Treatment will usually include:
antibiotics
surgery to remove the affected area
Even after successful treatment, there may be long-term changes in how your body looks and how you move or use the affected part of your body. Sometimes amputation of affected limbs is needed.
You may need further surgery and physiotherapy to help you recover."
Causes of necrotising fasciitis,"Necrotising fasciitis is an infection that can happen after getting a wound. It causes damage to the deep layers of your skin.
The infection may get into the body through:
cuts and scratches
burns and scalds
insect bites
surgery
injecting drugs
You may be more at risk from developing necrotising fasciitis if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system."
What problems can it cause?,"Most children with nephrotic syndrome have times when their symptoms are under control (remission), followed by times when symptoms return (relapses).
In most cases, relapses become less frequent as they get older and often stop by their late teens.
Some of the main symptoms associated with nephrotic syndrome include:
swelling – the low level of protein in the blood reduces the flow of water from body tissues back into the blood vessels, leading to swelling (oedema). Swelling is usually first noticed around the eyes, then around the lower legs and the rest of the body.
infections – antibodies are a specialised group of proteins in the blood that help to fight infection. When these are lost, children are much more likely to get infections.
urine changes – occasionally, the high levels of protein being passed into the urine can cause it to become frothy. Some children with nephrotic syndrome may also pass less urine than usual during relapses.
blood clots – important proteins that help prevent the blood clotting can be passed out in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome. This can increase their risk of potentially serious blood clots. During a relapse, the blood also becomes more concentrated, which can lead to clotting."
Causes of nephrotic syndrome,"Most children with nephrotic syndrome have ""minimal change disease"". This means that their kidneys appear normal or nearly normal if a tissue sample is studied under a microscope.
But changes to the tissue sample can be seen if it's studied under an extremely powerful electron microscope.
The cause of minimal change disease is unknown.
Nephrotic syndrome can sometimes occur as a result of a kidney problem or another condition, such as:
glomerulosclerosis – when the inside of the kidney becomes scarred
glomerulonephritis – inflammation inside the kidney
an infection – such as HIV or hepatitis
lupus
diabetes
sickle cell anaemia
in very rare cases, certain types of cancer – such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma or lymphoma
These problems tend to be more common in adults with nephrotic syndrome."
Diagnosing nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome can usually be diagnosed after dipping a dipstick into a urine sample.
If there are large amounts of protein in a person's urine, there will be a colour change on the stick.
A blood test showing a low level of a protein called albumin will confirm the diagnosis.
In some cases, when the initial treatment does not work, your child may need a kidney biopsy.
This is when a very small sample of kidney tissue is removed using a needle so it can be studied under a microscope."
Managing nephrotic syndrome,"The main treatment for nephrotic syndrome is steroids, but additional treatments may also be used if a child develops significant side effects.
Most children have relapses until their late teens and need to take steroids when these occur.
Your child may be referred to a childhood kidney specialist (paediatric nephrologist) for tests and specialist treatment.
Steroids
Children diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome for the first time are normally prescribed at least a 4-week course of the steroid medicine prednisolone, followed by a smaller dose every other day for 4 more weeks. This stops protein leaking from your child's kidneys into their urine.
When prednisolone is prescribed for short periods, there are usually no serious or long-lasting side effects, although some children may experience:
increased appetite
weight gain
red cheeks
mood changes
Most children respond well to treatment with prednisolone, with the protein often disappearing from their urine and the swelling going down within a few weeks. This period is known as remission.
Diuretics
Tablets that help you pee more (diuretics) may also be given to help reduce the fluid build-up. They work by increasing the amount of urine produced.
Penicillin
Penicillin is an antibiotic, and may be prescribed during relapses to reduce the chances of an infection.
Dietary changes
You may be advised to reduce the amount of salt in your child's diet to prevent further water retention and oedema.
This means avoiding processed foods and not adding salt to what you eat.
Get tips on how to cut down on salt
Vaccinations
Children with nephrotic syndrome are advised to have the pneumococcal vaccine.
Some children may also be recommended the varicella (chickenpox) vaccination between relapses.
Live vaccines, such as MMR, chickenpox and BCG, should not be given while your child is taking medication to control their symptoms.
Additional medication
Other medications may be used alongside or in place of steroids if your child's remission cannot be maintained with steroids or they experience significant side effects.
Additional medications that may be used include:
levamisole
cyclophosphamide
ciclosporin
tacrolimus
mycophenolate
rituximab
Albumin infusions
Most of the protein lost in nephrotic syndrome is a type called albumin.
If your child's symptoms are severe, they may be admitted to hospital to receive albumin infusions.
Albumin is slowly added to the blood over a few hours through a thin plastic tube called a cannula, which is inserted into one of the veins in their arm."
Caring for your child at home,"If your child has been diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, you'll need to monitor their condition on a daily basis to check for signs of relapses.
You'll need to use a dipstick to test your child's urine for protein the first time they urinate each day.
The results of a dipstick test are recorded as either:
negative – 0mg of proteinuria per decilitre of urine (mg/dL)
trace – 15 to 30mg/dL
1+ – 30 to 100mg/dL
2+ – 100 to 300mg/dL
3+ – 300 to 1,000mg/dL
4+ – over 1,000mg/dL
The result for each day needs to be written down in a diary for your doctor or specialist nurse to review during your outpatient appointments.
You should also note down the dose of any medication they're taking and any other comments, such as whether your child's feeling unwell.
If the dipstick shows 3+ or more of protein in the urine for 3 days in a row, this means your child is having a relapse.
If this happens, you either need to follow the advice given about starting steroids or contact your doctor.
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
your child has come into contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles and your doctor has told you that your child is not immune to these illnesses
your child is unwell or has a high temperature
your child has diarrhoea and is being sick"
Congenital nephrotic syndrome,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is usually caused by an inherited faulty gene.
For the condition to be passed on to a child, both parents must have a healthy copy of the gene and a faulty one.
Treating congenital nephrotic syndrome
If your child has congenital nephrotic syndrome, they'll need frequent albumin infusions to help them grow and develop normally. This often requires a stay in hospital.
Sometimes parents can be trained to administer the treatment at home.
Your child will be regularly reviewed at a clinic, where their blood pressure, growth, weight, kidney function and bone health will be monitored.
It can be difficult for parents to decide which option is best, so you should talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of hospital-based and home-based treatment.
Dialysis and kidney transplants
In some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove 1 or both of your child's kidneys.
This will stop proteins being lost in your child's urine and reduce their risk of potentially serious problems, such as blood clots.
If both kidneys do need to be removed, your child will need dialysis. Dialysis is where a machine replicates kidney function, from an early age until they can receive a kidney transplant.
A person only needs 1 kidney to survive, so a living person can donate a kidney. Ideally, this should be a close relative.
Find out more about kidney transplants"
Symptoms of neuroendocrine tumours,"The symptoms of a neuroendocrine tumour depend on where in the body it is and what hormones it produces.
For example, a tumour in the digestive system (gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumour) may cause diarrhoea, constipation or tummy pains.
A tumour in the lung (pulmonary neuroendocrine tumour) may cause wheezing or a persistent cough.
Some tumours may lead to abnormally large amounts of hormones being released into the bloodstream. These are known as ""functioning tumours"" and can cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems."
Causes of neuroendocrine tumours,"The cause of neuroendocrine tumours is not fully understood.
However, your chance of developing a tumour is increased if you have 1 of the following inherited conditions:
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)
neurofibromatosis type 1
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL)"
Diagnosing neuroendocrine tumours,"Many tests can be used to diagnose neuroendocrine tumours, including blood tests, urine tests, scans and a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination).
Types of scans used include:
ultrasound
CT (computerised tomography)
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
PET (positron emission tomography)
octreotide scans – where slightly radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and a special camera is used to highlight any cancerous cells"
Treatment for neuroendocrine tumours,"How a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your individual circumstances, such as:
where the tumour is
how advanced your condition is
your overall health
Unfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after the tumour has spread to other parts of the body.
However, it may still be possible to use surgery to remove the tumour. If surgery cannot completely cure your condition, it may be used to help reduce and manage any symptoms.
Medicine called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide or lanreotide, may be recommended. They stop your body producing too many hormones, and can reduce the severity of your symptoms and slow the condition's progression. You'll have an injection, usually once every 28 days.
It may also be possible to shrink the tumour or stop it growing using treatments that block its blood supply (embolisation), or using chemotherapy, radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells).
There are also other treatments – including everolimus, sunitinib and lutetium – that can be used to treat some neuroendocrine tumours in adults if:
they cannot be fully removed using surgery
they've spread
Everolimus is taken as a tablet, sunitinib is taken as a capsule and lutetium is given into a vein.
For more information, see:
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): guidance on everolimus and sunitinib
NICE: guidance on lutetium
Cancer Research UK: neuroendocrine tumours
Macmillan: neuroendocrine tumours"
Signs and symptoms,"In the early stages of having a neuroendocrine tumour, you may not have any symptoms.
You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.
If symptoms do develop, they tend to be general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.
Symptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.
Symptoms caused by the tumour
Symptoms will depend on where in the body the tumour develops:
a tumour in the bowel may cause tummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick or being sick) and bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
a tumour in the lung may cause a cough, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain and tiredness
a tumour in the stomach may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness
Some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance.
For example, a tumour in the appendix may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.
Symptoms caused by the hormones (carcinoid syndrome)
Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:
diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite
flushing of the skin, particularly the face
fast heart rate
breathlessness and wheezing
These symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.
Some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly.
There's also a risk of developing a rare but serious condition called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a changes in your blood pressure."
What causes neuroendocrine tumours?,"It's not known exactly why neuroendocrine tumours develop, but it's thought that most occur by chance.
Your chances of developing a neuroendocrine tumour may be increased if you have:
a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)
parents or siblings (brothers or sisters) with a carcinoid tumour
conditions called neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis
Read more about neuroendocrine tumours on the Cancer Research UK website"
Diagnosing neuroendocrine tumours,"A neuroendocrine tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix.
In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.
Otherwise, people usually see their GP after they have developed symptoms.
A neuroendocrine tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an endoscopy."
Treating neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome,"If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether.
Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).
If the tumour cannot be removed, but it's not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored. 
If it's causing symptoms, you may be offered treatment.
This can include:
injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour
radiotherapy to kill some of the cancer cells 
a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation
a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation
chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms
targeted drugs to help control the growth of the tumour, such as sunitinib, everolimus and interferon.
You may also be given medicine to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medicine.
Read more about surgery and treatments for neuroendocrine tumours on the Cancer Research UK website"
What can I do to help myself?,"There are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.
Generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:
alcohol
large meals
spicy foods
foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats
stress
If you have diarrhoea, it's important to keep drinking little and often to avoid dehydration."
Outlook,"If the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether.
But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medicine.
You might have treatment to help with symptoms if the tumour has spread to another organ, such as the liver.
Survival for people with neuroendocrine tumours depends on many things, including the person's condition and the type of tumour they have."
Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1,"NF1 is a condition you're born with, although some symptoms develop gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person.
In most cases, the skin is affected, causing symptoms such as:
birthmarks known as café au lait spots, which are light or dark brown patches that can be anywhere on the body
soft, non-cancerous tumours on or under the skin (neurofibromas)
clusters of freckles in unusual places – such as the armpits, groin and under the breast
problems with the bones, eyes and nervous system
Certain health problems are often associated with NF1, such as learning difficulties. Less commonly, NF1 is associated with a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.

Causes of neurofibromatosis type 1,"NF1 is caused by a faulty gene. If the NF1 gene is faulty, it leads to uncontrolled growth (tumours) developing in the nervous system.
In half of all cases of NF1, the faulty gene is passed from a parent to their child. Only one parent needs to have the faulty gene for their child to be at risk of developing the condition.
If either the mother or father has the faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance that each child they have will develop NF1.
In other cases, the faulty gene appears to develop spontaneously (where there is no family history of NF1). It's unclear why this happens. If you have a child who develops NF1 spontaneously, it's highly unlikely any further children you have will also develop the condition.
However, if you do have a child who develops NF1 spontaneously, they could pass on the condition to any children that they have."
Diagnosing neurofibromatosis type 1,"It's usually easy to diagnose NF1 in adults and older children by checking for the typical symptoms.
It may be diagnosed in babies who show symptoms of NF1 from birth. However, it's not always possible to make a firm diagnosis in early childhood because some symptoms take years to develop.
If NF1 is suspected, further tests such as scans, blood tests or a biopsy may be recommended. This is to assess whether your child has other symptoms or conditions associated with NF1.
If there's uncertainty about the diagnosis, your child may be able to have a blood test to see whether they have the faulty NF1 gene. However, the test is not completely reliable: around 5% of children who test negative for the faulty gene still develop NF1.
Before and during pregnancy
Couples with a family history of NF1 may wish to consider their options before having a baby. A GP can refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options.
These may include:
having a child with a donor egg or sperm
adopting a child
having a test during pregnancy – either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis to see if your baby will have NF1
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and tested to make sure they do not have the NF1 gene, before being implanted into the womb"
Treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1,"There's currently no cure for NF1. Treatment involves regular monitoring and treating any problems as they occur.
Treatment can involve:
surgery – to remove tumours and treat problems with bones
medicine – to control secondary conditions, such as high blood pressure
physiotherapy
psychological support
pain management
Careful monitoring and treatment can help people with NF1 live a full life. However, there's a risk of developing serious problems, such as certain types of cancer, that can reduce life expectancy.

NF1 and pregnancy,"If you become pregnant while living with NF1, you should be able to have a healthy pregnancy.
However, the number of neurofibromas may increase because of hormone changes. Make sure you're cared for by an obstetrician with knowledge of NF1, or speak to your NF1 specialist."

Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2,"Almost everyone with NF2 develops tumours along the nerves responsible for hearing and balance. These usually cause symptoms such as:
hearing loss that gradually gets worse over time
hearing ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus)
balance problems – particularly when moving in the dark or walking on uneven ground
You can also get other tumours inside the brain or spinal cord, or along the nerves to the arms and legs. This can lead to symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs, and persistent headaches.
Read more about the symptoms of NF2"
Causes of neurofibromatosis type 2,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by a faulty gene. If the NF2 gene is faulty, it leads to uncontrolled growths (tumours) developing in the nervous system.
In half of all cases of NF2, the faulty gene is passed from a parent to their child. Only 1 parent needs to have the faulty gene for their child to be at risk of developing the condition.
If either the mother or father has the faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance that each child they have will develop NF2.
In other cases, the faulty gene appears to develop spontaneously. It's unclear why this happens.
If you have a child who develops NF2 spontaneously, it's highly unlikely any further children you have will also develop the condition. However, your child with NF2 could pass on the condition to any children that they have.
Mosaic NF2
About 1 in 3 people with NF2 have a form of the disease called mosaic NF2. The symptoms of mosaic NF2 are milder and often restricted to a certain area or side of the body.
People with mosaic NF2 have lower than the usual 50% risk of having a child with NF2. However, if their child does have NF2, it will be the more common type and not mosaic NF2."
Diagnosing neurofibromatosis type 2,"It's usually easy to diagnose NF2 in adults and older children by checking for the typical symptoms.
It may be diagnosed in babies who show symptoms of NF2 from birth. However, it's not always possible to make a firm diagnosis before a child is 5 years old because some symptoms take years to develop.
If NF2 is suspected, further tests – such as scans, hearing tests, sight tests or blood tests – may be recommended. This is to assess whether your child has other symptoms or conditions associated with NF2.
If there's uncertainty about the diagnosis, your child may be able to have a blood test to see whether they have the faulty NF2 gene. However, the test is not completely reliable and may not find an alteration in the NF2 gene in all people with NF2 symptoms.
Before and during pregnancy
Couples with a family history of NF2 may wish to consider their options before having a baby. A GP can refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options, which may include:
having a child with a donor egg or sperm
adopting a child
having a test during pregnancy – either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis to see if your baby will have NF2
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – where eggs are fertilised and tested in a laboratory, and only eggs without the faulty NF2 gene are implanted in the womb."
Treatment for neurofibromatosis type 2,"There's currently no cure for NF2. Treatment involves regular monitoring and treating any problems as they occur.
Surgery can be used to remove most tumours, although it carries a risk of causing problems, such as complete deafness or facial weakness. Therefore, the risks and potential benefits need to be carefully considered before treatment.
Most people with NF2 eventually develop significant hearing loss and often benefit from using a hearing aid or learning to lip read. Special implants can sometimes be inserted to improve a person's hearing.
NF2 tends to get worse over time, although the speed at which this happens varies considerably. However, most people with NF2 eventually lose their hearing completely, and some people require a wheelchair or other type of mobility device.
Tumours developing inside the brain and spinal cord can place a strain on the body and shorten life expectancy.

Symptoms of NMO,"Each person will experience different symptoms, which can range from mild to severe.
These symptoms may include:
eye pain
loss of vision
colours appearing faded or less vivid
weakness in the arms and legs
pain in the arms or legs – described as sharp, burning, shooting or numbing
increased sensitivity to cold and heat
tight and painful muscle spasms in the arms and legs
vomiting
bladder, bowel and sexual problems
In many people with NMO, the spinal cord becomes swollen and irritated (inflamed). This is called transverse myelitis.
The optic nerve from the eye to the brain can also become inflamed – a condition called optic neuritis.
Some people may only experience transverse myelitis or optic neuritis but, if they have a specific antibody associated with NMO (AQP4) in their blood, they will be said to have NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD).
NMO-UK ha more information about the symptoms of NMO
NMO relapses
NMO can be one-off or relapsing. Some people may only have one attack of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis, with good recovery and no further relapses for a long time.
But if NMO is very severe, more attacks can follow. A relapse can take from several hours up to days to develop. The attacks can be unpredictable and it's not fully understood what triggers them.
NMO-UK has more information about NMO relapses"
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of NMO.
The GP will refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions that affect the nerves) for further testing to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other conditions with similar symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis.
You'll have an MRI scan of your brain and spinal cord, and blood tests. You may also have a lumbar puncture, where a sample of the fluid surrounding your spine is removed using a thin needle and tested.
NMO-UK ha more information about how NMO is diagnosed"
Treatments for NMO,"There's no cure for NMO, but treatments can help to ease symptoms, prevent future relapses and slows down the condition's progression.
You may be prescribed:
steroids to reduce the inflammation
medicine to suppress your immune system and ease your symptoms, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate or methotrexate
rituximab, a newer type of medicine to reduce inflammation
Rehabilitation techniques, such as physiotherapy, can also help if you have problems with your mobility.
Therapies and support groups are available.

Causes,"NMO is an autoimmune condition. This means the body's immune system reacts abnormally and attacks healthy tissues, causing the symptoms of NMO.
NMO is usually not inherited, but some people with NMO may have a history of autoimmune disorders in the family and may have another autoimmune condition themselves."
Driving,"Optic neuritis may affect your ability to drive. You have a legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your driving.

Why it happens,"NRDS usually occurs when the baby's lungs have not produced enough surfactant.
This substance, made up of proteins and fats, helps keep the lungs inflated and prevents them collapsing.
A baby normally begins producing surfactant sometime between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy.
Most babies produce enough to breathe normally by week 34.
If your baby is born prematurely, they may not have enough surfactant in their lungs.
Occasionally, NRDS affects babies that are not born prematurely.
For example, when:
the mother has diabetes
the baby is underweight
the baby's lungs have not developed properly
Around half of all babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy develop NRDS.
In recent years the number of premature babies born with NRDS has been reduced with the use of steroid injections, which can be given to mothers during premature labour."
Symptoms of NRDS,"The symptoms of NRDS are often noticeable immediately after birth and get worse over the following few days.
They can include:
blue-coloured lips, fingers and toes
rapid, shallow breathing
flaring nostrils
a grunting sound when breathing
If you're not in hospital when you give birth and notice the symptoms of NRDS in your baby, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance."
Diagnosing NRDS,"A number of tests can be used to diagnose NRDS and rule out other possible causes.
These include:
a physical examination
blood tests to measure the amount of oxygen in the baby's blood and check for an infection
a pulse oximetry test to measure how much oxygen is in the baby's blood using a sensor attached to their fingertip, ear or toe
a chest X-ray to look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of the lungs in NRDS"
Treating NRDS,"The main aim of treatment for NRDS is to help the baby breathe.
Treatment before birth
If you're thought to be at risk of giving birth before week 34 of pregnancy, treatment for NRDS can begin before birth.
You may have a steroid injection before your baby is delivered. A second dose is usually given 24 hours after the first.
The steroids stimulate the development of the baby's lungs. It's estimated that the treatment helps prevent NRDS in a third of premature births.
You may also be offered magnesium sulphate to reduce the risk of developmental problems linked to being born early.
If you take magnesium sulphate for more than 5 to 7 days or several times during your pregnancy, your newborn baby may be offered extra checks. This is because prolonged use of magnesium sulphate in pregnancy has in rare cases been linked to bone problems in newborn babies.
Treatment after the birth
Your baby may be transferred to a ward that provides specialist care for premature babies (a neonatal unit).
If the symptoms are mild, they may only need extra oxygen. It's usually given through an incubator, a small mask over their nose or face or tubes into their nose.
If symptoms are more severe, your baby will be attached to a breathing machine (ventilator) to either support or take over their breathing.
These treatments are often started immediately in the delivery room before transfer to the neonatal unit.
Your baby may also be given a dose of artificial surfactant, usually through a breathing tube.
Evidence suggests early treatment within 2 hours of delivery is more beneficial than if treatment is delayed.
They'll also be given fluids and nutrition through a tube connected to a vein.
Some babies with NRDS only need help with breathing for a few days. But some, usually those born extremely prematurely, may need support for weeks or even months.
Premature babies often have multiple problems that keep them in hospital, but generally they're well enough to go home around their original expected delivery date.
The length of time your baby needs to stay in hospital will depend on how early they were born."
Complications of NRDS,"Most babies with NRDS can be successfully treated, although they have a high risk of developing further problems later in life.
Air leaks
Air can sometimes leak out of the baby's lungs and become trapped in their chest cavity. This is known as a pneumothorax.
The pocket of air places extra pressure on the lungs, causing them to collapse and leading to additional breathing problems.
Air leaks can be treated by inserting a tube into the chest to allow the trapped air to escape.
Internal bleeding
Babies with NRDS may have bleeding inside their lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) and brain (cerebral haemorrhage).
Bleeding into the lungs is treated with air pressure from a ventilator to stop the bleeding and a blood transfusion.
Bleeding into the brain is quite common in premature babies, but most bleeds are mild and do not cause long-term problems.
Lung scarring
Sometimes ventilation (begun within 24 hours of birth) or the surfactant used to treat NRDS causes scarring to the baby's lungs, which affects their development.
This lung scarring is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Symptoms of BPD include rapid, shallow breathing and shortness of breath.
Babies with severe BPD usually need additional oxygen from tubes into their nose to help with their breathing.
This is usually stopped after a few months, when the lungs have healed.
But children with BPD may need regular medicine, such as bronchodilators, to help widen their airways and make breathing easier.
Developmental disabilities
If the baby's brain is damaged during NRDS, either because of bleeding or a lack of oxygen, it can lead to long-term developmental disabilities, such as learning difficulties, movement problems, impaired hearing and impaired vision.
But these developmental problems are not usually severe. For example, 1 survey estimated that 3 out of 4 children with developmental problems only have a mild disability, which should not stop them leading a normal adult life."
What is screening?,"Screening is a way of identifying apparently healthy people who may have an increased risk of a particular condition. The NHS offers a range of screening tests to different sections of the population.
The aim is to offer screening to the people who are most likely to benefit from it. For example, some screening tests are only offered to newborn babies, while others such as breast screening and abdominal aortic aneurysm screening are only offered to older people.
Screening results
If you get a normal result (a screen negative result) after a screening test, this means you are at low risk of having the condition you were screened for. This does not mean you will never develop the condition in the future, just that you are low risk at the moment.
If you have a higher-risk result (a screen positive result), it means you may have the condition that you've been tested for. At this point, you will be offered further tests (called diagnostic tests) to confirm if you have the condition. You can then be offered treatment, advice and support.
Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective. However, screening tests are not perfect and they can lead to difficult decisions about having further tests or treatment.
Read on to find out about the benefits, risks and limitations of screening."
What types of screening are offered by the NHS in England?,"An independent expert group called the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the NHS, in all 4 UK countries, on which screening programmes to offer.
The NHS screening programmes currently offered in England are listed below. For more detailed information on each type of screening, follow the links.

Screening in pregnancy
The screening tests offered in pregnancy are:
screening for infectious diseases (hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis)
screening for Down's syndrome, Patau's syndrome and Edwards' syndrome
screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia
screening to check the physical development of the baby (known as the 20-week scan or mid-pregnancy scan)
diabetic eye screening if you are pregnant and have type 1 or type 2 diabetes
Screening for newborn babies
Newborn babies are offered:
a physical examination, which includes the eyes, heart, hips and testes
a hearing test
a blood spot test to check if the baby has any of 9 rare conditions
Diabetic eye screening
From the age of 12, all people with diabetes are offered an annual diabetic eye test to check for early signs of diabetic retinopathy.
Cervical screening
Cervical screening is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 to check the health of cells in the cervix. It is offered every 3 years for those aged 25 to 49, and every 5 years from the ages of 50 to 64.
Breast screening
Breast screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70 to detect early signs of breast cancer. Women over 70 can self-refer.
Bowel cancer screening
Everyone aged 60 to 74 is offered a bowel cancer screening home test kit every 2 years.
If you're 75 or over, you can ask for a kit every 2 years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 60 60.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening
AAA screening is offered to men during the screening year (1 April to 31 March) that they turn 65 to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms (a dangerous swelling in the aorta). Men over 65 can self-refer."
"Benefits, risks and limitations of screening","Making an informed choice
Before having any screening test, it's worth finding out about the test itself and what would happen next if you found out you have a higher risk of a particular condition.
Deciding whether or not to have a screening test is a personal choice and one which only you can make. When you are invited for screening, you will receive an information leaflet about the screening test.
You can discuss any aspect of the screening test with your health professional and decide whether or not it's right for you.
Different types of screening have different benefits and risks. Some of these are listed below.
The benefits of having a screening test include:
Screening can detect a problem early, before you have any symptoms.
Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective.
Finding out you have a health problem or an increased chance of a health problem can help people make better informed decisions about their health.
Screening can reduce the chance of developing a condition or its complications.
Some deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms, bowel cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer can be prevented.
The risks and limitations of screening include:
Screening tests are not 100% accurate. You could be told you have a problem when you do not – this is called a ""false positive"" and may lead to some people having unnecessary further tests or treatment as a result of screening. A screening test could also miss a problem – this is called a ""false negative"" and could lead to people ignoring symptoms in the future.
Some screening tests can lead to difficult decisions. For example, if a pregnancy screening test tells you your baby has a higher chance of having a particular condition, you may then be faced with a decision about having further diagnostic tests that involve a risk to your pregnancy. If the diagnostic test is positive, you may then need to decide whether to continue with your pregnancy.
Finding out you may have a health problem can cause considerable anxiety.
Even if your screening test result is normal or negative (meaning you are not at high risk), you could still go on to develop the condition.
How does the NHS decide which types of screening to offer?
An expert group called the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the NHS on which screening programmes to offer.
When considering who to screen and which conditions to screen for, the benefits of offering a screening programme are weighed up against the harms. The UK NSC only recommends screening when it believes the benefits to the group offered screening outweigh the harms.
The UK NSC regularly reviews its recommendations on screening for different conditions as new research becomes available. This is usually done every 3 years.
Find out how the UK NSC reviews evidence and monitors the quality of screening programmes.
Private screening
All screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Private companies offer a range of screening tests that you have to pay for. Some of the tests on offer are not recommended by the UK NSC because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms.
The UK NSC has produced a downloadable leaflet on private screening."
Confidentiality and use of data,"By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe. The NHS Constitution sets out how the NHS should handle your records to protect your privacy. There are also laws in place to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.
Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them, such as technicians carrying out screening, your GP and any clinicians involved in follow-up tests and treatment. They are also shared with the Government who uses them to check that local screening services are safe and effective. Screening records are sometimes also shared with researchers looking at how to improve the screening programmes.

What night sweats are,"It's normal to sweat during the night if the room or your bedding is making you too hot.
Night sweats are when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet, even though where you're sleeping is cool.
Adults and children can get night sweats."
Treatment for night sweats from a GP,"If you have night sweats, you will not usually need treatment, but the GP will want to check if you have any other symptoms.
If you're taking medicine and the GP thinks it might be causing night sweats, they may prescribe a different one."
Causes of night sweats,"The most common reasons for night sweats are:
menopause symptoms (""hot flushes"")
anxiety
medicines, such as some antidepressants, steroids and painkillers
low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)
alcohol or drug use
a harmless condition called hyperhidrosis that makes you sweat too much all the time
Sometimes the cause of night sweats is unknown."
Check it's a night terror or nightmare,"Night terrors and nightmares are different and happen at different stages of sleep.
During a night terror you may talk and move about but are asleep. It's rare to remember having a night terror.
Nightmares are bad dreams you wake up from and can remember.
Night terrors are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8, while nightmares can affect both children and adults.
Differences between night terrors and nightmares.
Night terrors Nightmares
Mainly affect children Affect both children and adults
Scream, shout, thrash about, jump out of bed, eyes open but not awake, will not remember it Strong feelings of fear, child may wake up and be able to remember the dream
Happen in the early part of the night, sometimes more than once, lasting up to 15 minutes Happen later in the night
Information:
If you cannot move or speak as you wake up or fall asleep, you may have sleep paralysis. This is not the same as having a night terror."
Causes of night terrors and nightmares,"Common causes of night terrors and nightmares include:
being very tired or unwell
sudden noises at night or needing to pee during the night (which can affect your deep sleep)
something that's frightened you (such as watching a scary film) or made you stressed, anxious or worried
They can also be caused by:
taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants
conditions that affect sleep, such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnoea
mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
conditions that affect the brain, such as dementia
Night terrors are more common in people with family members who have had night terrors or who sleepwalk."
How to help a child who has night terrors or nightmares,"For most people, night terrors and nightmares get better on their own.
If your child is having night terrors or nightmares, there are things you can try to help.
Do
try having a relaxing bedtime routine
keep a sleep diary (including things you did during the day and evening, how you were feeling and how you slept) to help identify any causes
try to deal with things that might be causing stress or anxiety
How to help someone having night terrors
During a night terror, you should:
stay calm and wait for the person to calm down
do not talk to them or try to stop them moving about, unless there's a risk they could hurt themselves or someone else
do not try to wake them – they may not recognise you and may get more upset if you try to comfort them
If they're having a night terror at the same time every night, try waking them up 15 minutes before the night terror every night for a week. This can sometimes stop the night terrors happening."
Treatments for night terrors and nightmares,"Treatment for nightmares in adults depends on what may be causing them.
If you're having nightmares caused by a traumatic event, a GP may recommend psychological treatment such as counselling.
If you have a condition that affects your sleep, treatment will usually involve trying to manage the condition better."
Who gets nipple discharge,"Nipple discharge is more common if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. But it can affect anyone.
Liquid may leak from your nipples on its own or when they’re squeezed. It can be lots of different colours, including clear, white, yellow, green or bloody.
Nipple discharge may be nothing serious, but sometimes it can be a sign of an underlying condition, including a breast cyst or breast cancer. You should always get it checked."
What happens at your appointments,"If you have nipple discharge, the GP will examine your breasts or chest.
They may refer you to a hospital or breast clinic for further tests, which may include:
an examination of your breasts or chest
a mammogram (breast X-ray) or an ultrasound scan
a small sample of cells taken for testing (biopsy) – this is done using a needle
The tests are often done during the same visit.
The hospital or breast clinic should let you know when and how you’ll get your tests results. Some may be available that day. Others, such as a biopsy, can take several weeks."
Causes of nipple discharge,"Nipple discharge has many possible causes.
Common causes include:
pregnancy or breastfeeding, which can lead to leaking from your nipples
non-cancerous changes in the breast that happen with age (duct ectasia)
a blocked or enlarged milk duct
a small, non-cancerous lump in the breast (papilloma)
a breast infection (mastitis)
a side effect of a medicine, including the contraceptive pill
Nipple discharge can sometimes be a sign of breast cancer, so it's important to get it checked."
Stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"NAFLD develops in 4 main stages.
Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it.
In a small number of cases, it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed.
The main stages of NAFLD are:
simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed
fibrosis – where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally
cirrhosis – the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer
It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the condition getting worse."
Am I at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?,"You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:
are obese or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an ""apple-like"" body shape)
have type 2 diabetes
have a condition that affects how your body uses insulin
are insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovary syndrome
have an underactive thyroid
have high blood pressure
have high cholesterol
have metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity)
are over the age of 50
smoke
But NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children.
Although it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD is not caused by drinking too much alcohol."
Symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"There are not usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably will not know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.
Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of NAFLD) may experience:
a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)
extreme tiredness
unexplained weight loss
weakness
If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms, such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy (oedema).
See a GP urgently or call 111 if you have any of these symptoms and have a liver condition."
How non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is diagnosed,"NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out.
But blood tests do not always pick up NAFLD.
The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy.
This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.
If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan).
Some people may also need a biopsy, where a small sample of liver tissue is taken using a needle so it can be analysed in a laboratory.
Children and young people with an increased risk of NAFLD (those with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome) should have an ultrasound scan of their liver every 3 years.
Other tests you may have include a CT scan or MRI scan."
Treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"Most people with NAFLD will not develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.
There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help.
Treatment also may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.
You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems."
Things you can do if you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD.
For example, it can help to: 
lose weight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 (use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI); losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it
eat a healthy diet – try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt; eating smaller portions of food can help, too
have water instead of sweet drinks
exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week; all types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you do not lose weight
stop smoking – if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes
NAFLD is not caused by alcohol, but drinking may make it worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol."
Check if it's non-allergic rhinitis,"The most common symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis are:
a blocked or runny nose
sneezing
an itchy nose
a reduced sense of smell
Sometimes non-allergic rhinitis can also cause a crust to form inside the nose. This may have a bad smell and bleed if you try to remove it."
Causes of non-allergic rhinitis,"Common causes of non-allergic rhinitis include:
having a cold
changes in the weather, such as temperature or humidity
exercising
smoke, perfume and paint fumes
alcohol and spicy food
hormone changes in pregnancy or puberty, or from taking medicines such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the contraceptive pill
conditions such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
medicines such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, aspirin and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen
using decongestant nasal sprays too often
Information:
Non-allergic rhinitis is different from allergic rhinitis, which is caused by allergies such as hay fever."
Things you can do if you have non-allergic rhinitis,"Non-allergic rhinitis is not harmful, but it can affect your life.
You can often treat it without seeing a GP.
Try to avoid the things that trigger your symptoms, if you can.
A pharmacist can advise you about medicines that can help, such as:
antihistamines
nasal sprays to unblock your nose
salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose
You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week. Using them for longer than this can make the problem worse.
Find a pharmacy
How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution
If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better."
Treatments for non-allergic rhinitis from a GP,"Non-allergic rhinitis often gets better on its own without any treatment.
If needed, a GP may prescribe stronger medicine, such as prescription nasal sprays.
They may also change any medicine you're taking if they think it may be causing your symptoms.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe."
Check if you have urethritis,"Symptoms of urethritis include:
pain or a burning feeling when you pee
white or cloudy discharge from the vagina or penis
an irritated or sore tip of the penis
If urethritis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), it can take a few days or weeks for symptoms to appear after having sex.
Urethritis does not always have symptoms. If you have sex without a condom, a person with urethritis and no symptoms can pass on the infection without realising it."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of urethritis, you may have:
a swab test – a cotton bud takes a sample from the urethra (this can feel uncomfortable for a few seconds)
a urine test – you'll be asked not to pee for at least 2 hours before giving a urine sample as this can help make the results more reliable
You may also be offered tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Healthcare professionals at the clinic or GP surgery will tell you when you'll get your test results.
If the test shows that you have urethritis, anyone you've had sex with recently should be contacted and asked to get tested and treated if needed. The sexual health clinic can advise you about this."
Treatment for urethritis,"Urethritis is usually treated with antibiotics. It may take a week or two for your symptoms to disappear completely.
Any current sexual partners may also need treatment.
Avoid having sex (including oral sex) until you and any sexual partners have finished treatment and the symptoms have gone.
You may be asked to come back for another appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to check the treatment has worked."
Causes of urethritis,"Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia.
You can get it if you have unprotected sex (without a condom) with someone who has the infection.
Rarely, it can be caused by damaging the urethra (for example, from a urinary catheter).
Sometimes no cause for the urethritis can be found."
How to avoid getting urethritis,"You can reduce your chances of getting urethritis by:
using a condom every time you have vaginal sex or anal sex
using a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex
not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them
You can get tested for urethritis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) even if you do not have symptoms. This can help you avoid passing on infections without realising it."
Complications of urethritis,"Although complications are rare, sometimes urethritis can cause further problems such as:
reactive arthritis  – where the immune system attacks the joints or eyes, which can cause joint pain and conjunctivitis
epididymitis – where the infection spreads to the testicles
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – where the infection spreads to the womb or fallopian tubes (if untreated this can cause infertility)"
Who's affected,"In the UK, more than 13,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with just over a third of cases diagnosed in people over 75.
Slightly more men than women are affected."
What causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown.
But your risk of developing the condition is increased if:
you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system
you take immunosuppressant medicine
you have previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever
You also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition."
How non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed,"The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy.
This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.
Find out more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma"
Treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"There are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into 1 of 2 broad categories:
high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer grows quickly and aggressively
low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer grows slowly and you may not experience any symptoms for many years
The outlook and treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type, grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person's age.
Low-grade tumours do not necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure.
High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.
The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:
chemotherapy
radiotherapy
a targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy
Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable."
What causes Noonan syndrome?,"Noonan syndrome is caused by a fault in one of several genes. At least 8 different faulty genes have been linked to the condition so far.
In some cases, the faulty gene associated with Noonan syndrome is inherited from one of the child's parents. The parent with the faulty gene may or may not have obvious features of the condition themselves. Only one parent needs to carry the fault to pass it on and each child they have has a 50% chance of being born with the condition.
In other cases, the condition is caused by a new genetic fault that isn't inherited from either parent. In these cases, the chance of the parents having another child with Noonan syndrome is very small. 
Read more about the causes of Noonan syndrome."
Treatments for Noonan syndrome,"There's currently no single treatment for Noonan syndrome, but it's often possible to successfully manage many aspects of the condition.
For example, severe heart defects may need to be repaired with surgery, and growth hormone medicine may be used to help prevent restricted growth.
Your child may need quite a lot of treatment and support to help manage the various problems they have. However, they'll usually need much less care as they get older, because the condition tends to cause fewer problems in adulthood.
Read more about treating Noonan syndrome."
Outlook,"Noonan syndrome can range from being very mild to severe and life-threatening.
In many cases, the problems associated with the condition can be successfully treated at a young age or become less prominent over time. Almost all children with Noonan syndrome reach adulthood and most are able to lead normal, independent lives.
However, problems such as heart defects can occasionally be severe and life-threatening. Some children may need emergency surgery to correct the problem as soon as possible, and most people with Noonan syndrome will need to have their heart monitored regularly throughout their life."
Noonan Syndrome Association,"If you or your child has been diagnosed with Noonan syndrome, you may find the Noonan Syndrome Association a useful source of support and advice.
The charity Newlife, which helps families with disabled children, runs a free nurse helpline you can call – 0800 902 0095 – for more information."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child has Noonan syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat Noonan syndrome. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Check if you have norovirus,"The main symptoms of norovirus are:
feeling sick (nausea)
diarrhoea
being sick (vomiting)
You may also have:
a high temperature
a headache
aching arms and legs
The symptoms start suddenly within 1 to 2 days of being infected.
How to treat norovirus yourself
You can usually treat yourself or your child at home.
The most important thing is to rest and have lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.
You will usually start to feel better in 2 to 3 days.
Find out how to treat diarrhoea and vomiting in children and adults
Important:
School, nursery or work
Stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least 2 days. This is when you're most infectious.
Do not visit hospitals or care homes during this time."
How norovirus is spread,"Norovirus can spread very easily.
You can catch norovirus from:
close contact with someone with norovirus
touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching your mouth
eating food that's been prepared or handled by someone with norovirus
Washing your hands frequently with soap and water is the best way to stop it spreading. Alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus."
Causes of a nosebleed,"The inside of the nose is easy to damage and that's when nosebleeds happen. This can be caused by:
picking your nose
blowing your nose too hard
the inside of your nose being too dry (maybe because of a change in air temperature)
Nosebleeds that need medical attention can come from deeper inside the nose and usually affect adults. They can be caused by:
an injury or broken nose
conditions that affect the blood vessels or how the blood clots
certain medicines, like warfarin
Sometimes the cause of a nosebleed is unknown.
Certain people are more likely to getting nosebleeds, including:
children
adults over 45 years old
pregnant women
people with high blood pressure"
How to stop a nosebleed yourself,"If you have a nosebleed, you should:
sit down and lean forward, with your head tilted forward and your mouth open
pinch your nose just above your nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes
breathe through your mouth
Holding an icepack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on the top of the nose may help reduce the blood flow. But the evidence to show it works is not very strong."
Treatment for nosebleeds,"If you have a nosebleed and a doctor can see where the blood is coming from, they may use a stick with a chemical on it to stop the bleeding. This is pushed into the nostril to seal the area.
If this is not possible, they might pack your nose with ribbon gauze or sponge, to stop the bleeding. You may need to stay in hospital for a day or two.
When your nosebleed stops, a doctor may prescribe an antiseptic cream to use inside your nose. This stops crusting, or scabs forming. Check the cream's ingredients first, as it may not be suitable if you have a peanut or soya allergy."
When a nosebleed stops,"After a nosebleed, to reduce the chance of another nosebleed, try not to do the following for 24 hours:
blow your nose
pick your nose
drink hot drinks or alcohol
do any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise
pick any scabs
lie down flat"
Types of NSAIDs,"NSAIDs are available as tablets, capsules, suppositories (capsules inserted into the bottom), creams, gels and injections.
Some can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others need a prescription.
The main types of NSAIDs include:
ibuprofen
naproxen
diclofenac
celecoxib
mefenamic acid
etoricoxib
indomethacin
aspirin for pain relief (low-dose aspirin is not normally considered to be an NSAID)
NSAIDs may be sold or prescribed under these names or a brand name.
They're all similarly effective, although you may find a particular one works best for you."
Who can take NSAIDs,"Most people can take NSAIDs, but some people need to be careful about taking them.
It's a good idea to ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice before taking an NSAID if you:
are over 65 years of age
are pregnant or trying for a baby
are breastfeeding
have asthma
have had an allergic reaction to NSAIDs in the past
have had stomach ulcers in the past
have any problems with your heart, liver, kidneys, blood pressure, circulation or bowels
are taking other medicines
are looking for medicine for a child under 16 (do not give any medicine that contains aspirin to children under 16)
NSAIDs might not necessarily need to be avoided in these cases, but they should only be used on the advice of a healthcare professional as there may be a higher risk of side effects.
If NSAIDs are not suitable, your pharmacist or doctor may suggest alternatives to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol."
Side effects of NSAIDs,"Like all medicines, there's a risk of side effects from NSAIDs.
These tend to be more common if you're taking high doses for a long time, or you're elderly or in poor general health.
Over-the-counter NSAIDs generally have fewer side effects than stronger prescription medicines.
Possible side effects of NSAIDs include:
indigestion – including stomach aches, feeling sick and diarrhoea
stomach ulcers – these can cause internal bleeding and anaemia; extra medicine to protect your stomach may be prescribed to help reduce this risk
headaches
drowsiness
dizziness
allergic reactions
in rare cases, problems with your liver, kidneys or heart and circulation, such as heart failure, heart attacks and strokes
If you're bothered by side effects, stop taking your medicine and tell your doctor."
Interactions with other medicines,"Some NSAIDs can react unpredictably with other medicines.
This can affect how well either medicine works and increase the risk of side effects.
It's particularly important to get medical advice before taking an NSAID if you're already taking:
another NSAID
low-dose aspirin or warfarin – medicines used to prevent blood clots
ciclosporin – a medicine used to treat autoimmune conditions, such as arthritis or ulcerative colitis
diuretics – medicines sometimes used to treat high blood pressure
lithium – a medicine used to treat mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and severe depression
methotrexate – a medicine used to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) – examples of SSRIs are citalopram and fluoxetine (Prozac)
If you're not sure whether a medicine you're taking is safe to take at the same time as an NSAID, check the leaflet that comes with it, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice."
Food and alcohol,"The leaflet that comes with your medicine should say whether you need to avoid any particular foods or drinks. Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you're not sure.
For information about a specific medicine, check the product information about medicines on the GOV.UK website.
Generally, you do not need to avoid any specific foods while taking NSAIDs. 
Tablets or capsules should normally be swallowed whole, without chewing, and taken with water or food to stop them upsetting your stomach.
It's usually safe to drink alcohol while taking NSAIDs, but drinking alcohol excessively may irritate your stomach."
Overdoses of NSAIDs,"Taking too much of an NSAID can be dangerous. This is known as taking an overdose.
Contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice immediately if you take too much of your medicine.
Call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else experiences serious effects of an overdose, such as fits (seizures), breathing difficulties, or loss of consciousness."
Alternatives to NSAIDs,"As NSAIDs can cause troublesome side effects, alternatives are often recommended first.
The main alternative for pain relief is paracetamol, which is available over the counter and is safe for most people to take.
NSAID creams and gels that you rub into your skin may be worth trying first if you have muscle or joint pain in a particular part of your body, as they tend to have fewer side effects than tablets or capsules.
Your doctor may also be able to recommend different medicines and therapies depending on the health problem you have.
For example, physiotherapy may help some people with muscle or joint pain."
How to tell if you're living with obesity,"The most widely used method to check if you're a healthy weight is body mass index (BMI).
BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the NHS BMI healthy weight calculator to find out your BMI.
For most adults, if your BMI is:
below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range
18.5 to 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range
25 to 29.9 – you're in the overweight range
30 to 39.9 – you're in the obese range
40 or above – you're in the severely obese range
If you have a South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background you'll need to use a lower BMI score to measure overweight and obesity:
23 to 27.4 – you're in the overweight range
27.5 or above – you're in the obese range
BMI score has some limitations because it measures whether a person is carrying too much weight but not too much fat. For example, people who are very muscular, like professional sportspeople, can have a high BMI without much fat.
But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight.
Another measure of excess fat is waist to height ratio, which can be used as an additional measure in adults who have a BMI under 35.
To calculate your waist to height ratio, measure around your waist just above your belly button, and divide it by your height, measured in the same units (for example, centimetres or inches).
A waist to height ratio of 0.5 or higher means you may have increased health risks."
Risks of living with obesity,"Obesity is a serious health concern that increases the risk of many other health conditions.
These include:
type 2 diabetes
coronary heart disease
some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer
stroke
Living with overweight and obesity can also affect your quality of life and contribute to mental health problems, such as depression, and can also affect self-esteem."
Causes of obesity,"Obesity is a complex issue with many causes. Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories, particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat.
Obesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity.
Genetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat.
There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines.
Some medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions."
Treating obesity,"The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly.
To do this, you can:
eat a balanced calorie-controlled diet as recommended by a GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)
take up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (2.5 to 5 hours) a week
You may benefit from joining a local weight management programme with group meetings or online support. Your GP can tell you about these.
You may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits.
If you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended.
If taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.
A specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide or semaglutide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry.
For some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend weight loss surgery."
Other obesity-related problems,"Living with obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.
Day-to-day problems related to obesity include:
breathlessness
increased sweating
snoring
difficulty doing physical activity
often feeling very tired
joint and back pain
low confidence and self-esteem
feeling isolated
The psychological problems associated with living with obesity can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.
Serious health conditions
Living with obesity can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including:
type 2 diabetes 
high blood pressure
high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke
asthma
metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity
several types of cancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer and womb cancer
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the gullet
gallstones 
reduced fertility
osteoarthritis, a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints
sleep apnoea, a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease
liver disease and kidney disease
pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia, when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy
Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is."
Outlook,"Managing a complex issue like obesity can be hard. Losing weight takes time and commitment.
The healthcare professionals involved with your care can provide encouragement and advice about how to mange your weight, build healthy lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss achieved.
Completing a weight management programme, regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with ways to lose weight can also help.
It's important to remember that losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease."
Couch to 5K,"If it's been a long time since you did any exercise, you should check out the Couch to 5K running plan.
It consists of podcasts delivered over the course of 9 weeks and has been specifically designed for absolute beginners.
To begin with, you start running for short periods of time, and as the plan progresses, gradually increase the amount.
At the end of the 9 weeks, you should be able to run for 30 minutes non-stop, which for most people is around 5 kilometres (3.1 miles)."
Check if you have sleep apnoea,"Symptoms of sleep apnoea mainly happen while you sleep.
They include:
breathing stopping and starting
making gasping, snorting or choking noises
waking up a lot
loud snoring
During the day, you may also:
feel very tired
find it hard to concentrate
have mood swings
have a headache when you wake up
Information:
It can be hard to tell if you have sleep apnoea. It may help to ask someone to stay with you while you sleep so they can check for the symptoms."
Getting tested for sleep apnoea,"If a GP thinks you might have sleep apnoea, they may refer you to a specialist sleep clinic for tests.
At the clinic, you may be given devices that check things like your breathing and heartbeat while you sleep.
You'll be asked to wear these overnight so doctors can check for signs of sleep apnoea.
You can usually do this at home, but sometimes you may need to stay in the clinic overnight.
The test can show if you have sleep apnoea and how severe it is. This is based on how often your breathing stops while you sleep (AHI score).
Understanding your AHI score"
Treatments for sleep apnoea,"Sleep apnoea can sometimes be treated by making lifestyle changes like losing weight, giving up smoking and reducing how much alcohol you drink.
But many people need to use a device called a CPAP machine. You'll be given this for free on the NHS if you need it.
CPAP machine
A CPAP machine gently pumps air into a mask you wear over your mouth or nose while you sleep.
It can help:
improve your breathing while you sleep by stopping your airways getting too narrow
improve the quality of your sleep and help you feel less tired
reduce the risk of problems linked to sleep apnoea, such as high blood pressure
Using a CPAP machine may feel strange or awkward at first, but try to keep using it. It works best if you use it every night.
Tell your doctor if you find it uncomfortable or hard to use.
Other treatments
Other treatments sometimes used for sleep apnoea include:
a gum shield-like device that holds your airways open while you sleep (mandibular advancement device)
surgery to help your breathing, such as removing large tonsils
These treatments may not work as well as a CPAP machine."
Things you can do to help with sleep apnoea,"If you've been diagnosed with sleep apnoea, there are some things you can do to help.
These may be all you need to do if your sleep apnoea is mild.
Do
try to lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly – being active can improve your symptoms and help you keep to a healthy weight
have good sleep habits like making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day
sleep on your side – try taping a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear, or buy a special pillow or bed wedge to help keep you on your side
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol – especially shortly before going to sleep
do not take sleeping pills unless recommended by a doctor – they can make sleep apnoea worse"
Sleep apnoea can cause other problems,"Without treatment, sleep apnoea can lead to other problems including:
high blood pressure
a higher chance of having a stroke
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
depression or mood changes
a higher chance of having a serious accident caused by tiredness, such as a car accident
difficulty concentrating at work or school
Sleep apnoea can also be difficult for your partner and put a strain on your relationship with them."
Causes of sleep apnoea,"Sleep apnoea happens if your airways become too narrow while you sleep. This stops you breathing properly.
Sleep apnoea has been linked to:
obesity
having a large neck
getting older – although children and young adults can also get it
having other family members with sleep apnoea
smoking and drinking alcohol
having large tonsils or adenoids
sleeping on your back
a condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)"
How to get occupational therapy,"You can get occupational therapy free through the NHS or social services, depending on your situation.
You can:
speak to a GP about a referral
find your local council on GOV.UK to ask if you can get occupational therapy
You can also pay for it yourself. The Royal College of Occupational Therapists lists qualified and registered occupational therapists.
Find an occupational therapist on the Royal College of Occupational Therapists website
You can check an occupational therapist is qualified and registered with the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) using the online register of health and care professionals on the HCPC website."
How occupational therapy can help you,"Occupational therapy can help you with practical tasks if you:
are physically disabled
are recovering from an illness or operation
have learning disabilities
have mental health problems
are getting older
Occupational therapists work with people of all ages and can look at all aspects of daily life in your home, school or workplace.
They look at activities you find difficult and see if there's another way you can do them.
The Royal College of Occupational Therapists has more information about what occupational therapy is."
Causes of oesophageal atresia,"Oesophageal atresia is thought to be caused by a problem with the development of the oesophagus while the baby is in the womb, although it's not clear exactly why this happens.
The condition is more common in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy (polyhydramnios).
It's also more common in babies who have problems with the development of their kidneys, heart and spine.
The risk of having another baby with oesophageal atresia is thought to be very small."
Diagnosing oesophageal atresia,"Doctors may suspect your baby has oesophageal atresia before they're born if routine ultrasound scans show a lot of amniotic fluid in the womb, although this can have a number of causes.
Tests to check for the condition will be carried out after your baby is born, if they seem to be having problems swallowing or breathing.
A thin feeding tube may be passed down your baby's throat through their nose, to see if it reaches their stomach, and an X-ray may be carried out to check the oesophagus."
Repairing the defects,"An operation to repair an oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula is usually done soon after birth.
Your baby will be taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, where they're given a general anaesthetic.
They'll receive nutrition into a vein (intravenously) and a suction tube is used to remove fluid from the pouch in their oesophagus.
The surgeon makes a cut on the right side of the chest, between the ribs, and closes off the abnormal connection (fistula) between the oesophagus and windpipe. They'll then sew together the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus.
If the gap in the oesophagus is large, your child may need to wait a few months for the operation, to allow their oesophagus to grow a bit more. During this time, they'll need to have a feeding tube temporarily placed into their stomach through their tummy.
Occasionally, a procedure to lengthen the oesophagus before repairing it may be carried out."
After surgery,"After surgery, your child will be kept in the intensive care unit and placed in an incubator.
They may also need:
antibiotics
a machine to help them breathe (ventilator)
a tube into their chest to drain fluids or air that might be trapped
oxygen
pain medicine
Your baby will be given nutrition intravenously at first, but you should be able to feed them after a few days using a feeding tube passed into their stomach through their nose."
Going home,"You'll be able to take your baby home once they're taking food by mouth. This will usually take a week or two. You'll be advised about how to feed your child when they get home and as they get older.
Breast or bottle feeding will usually be recommended for at least the first few months.
It may then be possible to very gradually wean your child on to thicker foods. The hospital may be able to refer you to a dietitian for specific advice.
Contact the hospital or your GP if your child is choking or coughing on their feeds, has any difficulty swallowing or is failing to gain weight."
Risks of surgery,"With any surgery, there's a small risk of bleeding and infection.
For this particular operation, the additional risks are:
food or air leaking from the area being repaired
narrowing of the repaired oesophagus
reopening of the fistula between the oesophagus and windpipe
A further procedure or operation may be needed to treat these problems if they develop."
Outlook,"Most children who have surgery will go on to have normal lives.
But there's a chance your child may experience some further problems, including:
swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – where acid leaks out of the stomach and up into the oesophagus
asthma-like symptoms – such as persistent coughing or wheezing
recurrent chest infections
tracheomalacia – where the repaired section of windpipe becomes floppy and makes breathing difficult
Your child will be continuously monitored by specialists after their operation to pick up problems such as these and treat them early on. Some of these problems will improve as your child gets older."
Help and support,"Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support (TOFS) is a charity that supports people born with oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula and their families.
As well as visiting the TOFS website, you can call their helpline on 0115 961 3092."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child had oesophageal atresia as a baby, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists to better understand oesophageal atresia. You can opt out of the register at any time."
How you get orf,"Orf is a virus that mainly affects young lambs and goats.
You can get it if you have a sore, cut or scratch that touches an infected animal. You're most at risk if you have regular contact with sheep or goats – for example, if you're a farmer or if you bottle feed a lamb.
Orf causes scabs around the animal's nose and mouth, which may spread to their legs and teats. It's not usually serious but is passed easily between animals.
Sheep and goats can be vaccinated against the orf virus. But people can get infected if they come into contact with recently vaccinated or unvaccinated animals.
It's very rare for orf to be passed from one person to another."
Check if it's orf,"Orf usually affects the skin on your fingers, hands, forearms or face.
To start with, the affected area of skin is small and may look a reddish-blue colour. It may be itchy or tender.
Credit:
The patch of skin may look darker if you have black or brown skin.
Over a few weeks, the affected area of skin gets bigger and turns into a blister.
Credit:

The blister is usually 2 to 3cm, but it can grow up to 5cm. It may leak fluid before crusting over.
Other symptoms of orf include:
a high temperature
general tiredness (fatigue)
swollen glands on the inside of your elbow or under your arm"
Treatments for orf,"There's no specific treatment for orf.
The blister on your skin should clear up in around 6 weeks. Cover it with a waterproof dressing to keep it clean and dry and stop it getting infected.
If it becomes infected, you may need antibiotics.
Rarely, minor surgery may be needed to remove the affected area of skin if it does not clear up by itself."
How to reduce your risk of getting orf,"There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of getting orf.
Do
wear latex gloves when touching sheep and goats
cover sores, cuts or scratches with a waterproof dressing, especially when handling sheep and goats
wash your hands with warm water and soap after touching animals
vaccinate sheep and goats against orf
regularly clean and disinfect barns and sheds where livestock is kept"
Complications of orf,"Orf can affect some people more severely than others.
Your risk of getting complications is higher if you have a weakened immune system – for example, by having a condition like HIV, or a treatment like chemotherapy.
Possible complications include:
a bacterial infection
a rash that looks like a target or ""bulls-eye"" (erythema multiforme)
a skin condition that can cause large blisters (bullous pemphigoid)"
Why orthodontics is used,"The benefits of orthodontics can include:
correction of dental crowding and straightening of your teeth
correction of your bite so the front and back teeth meet evenly
reducing the chance of damage to prominent teeth
Many people have crowded or crooked teeth, or their teeth do not meet correctly when they bite. These problems can mean it's harder to keep your teeth and gums clean and your teeth are more likely to become damaged.
In some cases, abnormal positioning of your teeth and jaw can affect the shape of your face.
Orthodontics can also help in the treatment of other health problems, such as a cleft lip and palate."
Orthodontic treatment,"Orthodontic treatment is usually only started after most of a child's adult teeth have started to come through.
This is usually when they're about 12 years old, but it depends on how many of their adult teeth have come through and the growth of their face and jaws.
Orthodontic treatment for adults can begin at any age.
Treatment will not begin unless you have a good standard of oral hygiene, as orthodontic treatment can increase the risk of tooth decay and gum problems."
Types of orthodontic treatment,"Orthodontics involves the use of braces to correct the position of the teeth. Your exact treatment will depend on the problem with your teeth.
In a small number of cases, you may have to wear headgear, or have small screws placed temporarily in your jaw as well as wearing a brace. If your teeth are very close together, causing them to twist or overlap, you may also need to have some teeth removed as part of your treatment.
The length of treatment will depend on how complicated the problem is, but it's usually between 6 and 30 months. You should be given a more detailed estimate before starting treatment.
When treatment finishes, you will need to wear a retaining brace. This is usually removable and needs to be worn every night to keep your teeth in their new position. They're usually used for at least 12 months, but your orthodontist will advise you. Sometimes a thin wire may be permanently fixed behind your teeth to keep them in place.
Read more about the types of orthodontic treatment."
Accessing orthodontic treatment,"In most cases, your dentist will refer you to an orthodontist, although you may sometimes be able to get treatment directly from your dentist.
Find a local dentist
All dentists and orthodontists have to be registered with the General Dental Council (GDC) to practise in the UK.
Search the GDC registers to find registered dentists in your area
NHS treatment
NHS orthodontic treatment is free for people under the age of 18 with a clear health need for treatment. But because of high demand, there can be a long waiting list.
A rating system called the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) is used to assess eligibility for NHS treatment.
NHS treatment is available for grade 4 and grade 5 cases. Grade 3 cases are usually judged on an individual basis. NHS treatment may also be available if the appearance of your teeth, jaw or face is of concern.
Orthodontic treatment is not usually available on the NHS for adults. Most adults have private treatment.
Private treatment
If you do not qualify for free NHS treatment, or you do not want to wait for treatment to start, you may choose to have private treatment.
Private orthodontic treatment is widely available, but expensive. The fee can range from £2,000 to £6,000, depending on the complexity of the treatment and the type of appliances used, but fees can be higher.
After an initial assessment, a private orthodontist will talk to you about a possible treatment plan, how much it will cost and any alternative options you have."
Taking care of your teeth,"A common complication of orthodontics is white spots on the teeth, which are an early sign of tooth decay. This can happen when acid is produced from plaque, which builds up on your teeth and around your brace.
Cleaning your teeth and brace can be time-consuming, but it's needed to avoid permanent marks on your teeth when the brace is removed.
Many people with appliances find it difficult to keep their teeth and gums clean, so extra brushing is needed during treatment.
Your orthodontist may recommend using toothpaste with a high level of fluoride, or a mouthwash that contains fluoride, to reduce your risk of tooth decay. You should also try to avoid sugary foods and fizzy drinks.
Read more about how to take care of your teeth and gums."
Symptoms of osteoarthritis,"The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are joint pain and stiffness, and problems moving the joint.
Some people also have symptoms such as:
swelling
tenderness
grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints
The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints.
For some people, the symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Other people can experience more continuous and severe problems which make it difficult to carry out everyday activities.
Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands.
You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment.
Read more about the symptoms of osteoarthritis."
Causes of osteoarthritis,"As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body repairs the damage itself and you do not experience any symptoms.
But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become swollen and red. (Redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin.)
The exact cause is not known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including:
joint injury – overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation
other conditions (secondary arthritis) – osteoarthritis can happen in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout
age – your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older
family history – osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies have not identified a single gene responsible
obesity – being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips
being a woman – osteoarthritis is more common in women than men"
Diagnosing osteoarthritis,"To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, a GP will first ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints.
A GP may suspect osteoarthritis if:
you're aged 45 or older
you have joint pain that gets worse the more you use your joints
the stiffness in your joints is not there in the mornings, or lasts less than 30 minutes
If your symptoms are slightly different, this may indicate another joint condition. For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis.
Further tests – such as X-rays or blood tests – are not usually necessary, but may be used to rule out other possible causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone."
Treating osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and cannot be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms.
Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with simple measures, including:
regular exercise
losing weight if you're overweight
wearing suitable footwear
using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during your everyday activities
If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as painkillers and a structured exercise plan with a physiotherapist.
In a small number of cases, where these treatments haven't helped or the damage to the joints is particularly severe, surgery may be done to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint.
Find out more about treating osteoarthritis."
Living with osteoarthritis,"As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it's important you receive support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility, and advice on any necessary financial support.
Some people may find it helpful to talk to their GP or others who are living with osteoarthritis, as there may be questions or worries you want to share.
Find out more about living with osteoarthritis."
Preventing osteoarthritis,"It's not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether. However, you may be able to minimise your risk of developing the condition by avoiding injury and living a healthy lifestyle.
Exercise
Exercise or a job that puts frequent strain on your joints and forces them to bear an excessive load can increase your risk of osteoarthritis.
Try to do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, plus strength exercises on 2 or more days each week that work the major muscle groups, to keep yourself generally healthy.
Find out more about health and fitness, including tips on simple exercises you can do at home.
Posture
It can also help to maintain good posture at all times and avoid staying in the same position for too long.
If you work at a desk, make sure your chair is at the correct height, and take regular breaks to move around.
Losing weight
Being overweight or obese increases the strain on your joints and your risk of developing osteoarthritis. If you're overweight, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition.
Use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out whether you're overweight or obese.

Versus Arthritis: Osteoarthritis"
What causes rickets?,"A lack of vitamin D or calcium is the most common cause of rickets. Vitamin D largely comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, but it's also found in some foods, such as oily fish and eggs. Vitamin D is essential for the formation of strong and healthy bones in children.
In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body.
Read more about the causes of rickets."
Who's affected?,"Rickets was common in the past, but it mostly disappeared in the western world during the early 20th century after foods like margarine and cereal were fortified with vitamin D.
However, in recent years, there's been an increase in cases of rickets in the UK. The number of rickets cases is still relatively small, but studies have shown a significant number of people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D in their blood.
Any child who doesn't get enough vitamin D or calcium either through their diet, or from sunlight, can develop rickets. But the condition is more common in children with dark skin, as this means they need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D, as well as children born prematurely or taking medication that interferes with vitamin D."
Treating rickets,"For most children, rickets can be successfully treated by ensuring they eat foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, or by taking vitamin supplements.
Some families are eligible for free vitamin supplements from the government's Healthy Start scheme – find out if you're eligible and how to apply.
If your child has problems absorbing vitamins and minerals, they may need a higher supplement dose or a yearly vitamin D injection.
Read more about treating rickets."
Preventing rickets,"Rickets can easily be prevented by eating a diet that includes vitamin D and calcium, spending some time in sunlight, and if necessary, taking vitamin D supplements.
Read more about:
preventing rickets
who should take vitamin D supplements
how much vitamin D adults, children and babies need"
When to seek medical advice,"Take your child to see your GP if they have any of the signs and symptoms of rickets.
Your GP will carry out a physical examination to check for any obvious problems. They may also discuss your child's medical history, diet, family history, and any medication they're taking.
A blood test can usually confirm a diagnosis of rickets, although your child may also have some X-rays or possibly a bone density scan (DEXA scan). This is a type of X-ray that measures the calcium content in bones.
If you're an adult and you’re experiencing bone pain or muscle weakness you should also see your GP to get it checked out."
Who's at risk of getting osteomyelitis,"Anyone can develop osteomyelitis, but you're more at risk of getting it if you have:
had osteomyelitis before
diabetes, especially if you also have a foot ulcer
broken (fractured) a bone
been injured and have a wound
had an infection
had surgery
a weakened immune system (for example, because of chemotherapy, or you have a condition such as HIV)
Children may also be more likely to get osteomyelitis after having a respiratory infection or chickenpox."
Symptoms of osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis usually causes severe pain, most often affecting the legs, but it may affect other parts of the body.
Other symptoms of osteomyelitis can include:
swelling of the affected area
a feeling of warmth on the affected area
redness of the skin in the affected area, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin
a limp (more common in children)
a high temperature"
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP will examine the area and may do some tests to find out if you have a bone infection.
You might need a blood test, or to go to hospital for:
an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan
a biopsy, where a small sample of fluid is taken from the bone and sent for testing"
Treatment for osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is treated with antibiotics. You may need treatment in hospital, or you might be able to take antibiotics at home.
You'll usually take antibiotics for 4 to 6 weeks. If you have a severe infection, you may need to take them for up to 12 weeks. It's important to finish a course of antibiotics even if you start to feel better.
If the infection is treated quickly (within 3 to 5 days of it starting), it often clears up completely.
You can take painkillers to ease the pain. If the infection is in a long bone (such as an arm or leg), you may be fitted with a splint so you do not move it as often.
Surgery for osteomyelitis
You'll usually need an operation if:
a build-up of pus (abscess) develops in the bone and the pus needs to be drained
the infection presses against something else, for example, the spinal cord
the infection has lasted a long time and damaged the bone
If the infection has damaged the bone, you'll need surgery (known as debridement) to remove the damaged part.
Debridement can leave an empty space in the bone, which may need to be reconstructed.
Sometimes more than 1 operation is needed to treat the infection. Muscle and skin from another part of the body might be used to repair the area near the affected bone."
Diabetes and osteomyelitis,"It's very important to look after your feet if you have diabetes.
If you have poorly controlled diabetes, you can lose sensation in your feet and not notice small cuts, which could develop into an infection that spreads to the bone."
When it's used,"Most people who see an osteopath do so for help with conditions that affect the muscles, bones and joints, such as:
lower back pain
uncomplicated neck pain (as opposed to neck pain after an injury such as whiplash)
shoulder pain and elbow pain (for example, tennis elbow)
arthritis
problems with the pelvis, hips and legs
sports injuries
muscle and joint pain associated with driving, work or pregnancy
If you're pregnant, make sure you seek advice from a GP or midwife about your symptoms before you see an osteopath. You should also make sure you see an osteopath who specialises in muscle or joint pain during pregnancy."
Effectiveness of osteopathy,"Most research into techniques used in osteopathy tends to focus on general ""manual therapy"" techniques, such as spinal manipulation. Manual therapy techniques are used by physiotherapists and chiropractors, as well as osteopaths.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on managing lower back pain and sciatica recommend manual therapy alongside exercise as a treatment option.
NICE also recommends manual therapy as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis, although osteopathy is not specifically mentioned.
There's some evidence to suggest that osteopathy may be effective for some types of neck, shoulder or lower-limb pain, some types of headache, and recovery after hip or knee operations.
There's only limited or no scientific evidence that it's an effective treatment for conditions unrelated to the bones and muscles (musculoskeletal system), including:
asthma
period pain
digestive disorders
depression
excessive crying in babies (colic)
glue ear
problems affecting the jaw (temporomandibular disorder)
abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)"
Accessing osteopathy,"Osteopathy is available in some areas on the NHS. Your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) should be able to tell you whether it's available in your area.
Most people pay for osteopathy treatment privately. Treatment costs vary, but typically range from £40 to £55 for a 30- to 40-minute session.
You do not need to be referred by your GP to see an osteopath privately. Most private health insurance providers also provide cover for osteopathic treatment.
Only people registered with the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) are allowed to practise as or call themselves osteopaths.
You can find a nearby registered osteopath on the GOsC website.
Read more about how osteopathy is regulated."
Symptoms of an osteophyte,"Osteophytes often do not cause any problems. You may only find out you have one when you have an X-ray for another reason.
But they can sometimes cause problems if they rub against bone or muscles, affect your movement or put pressure on nerves.
The main symptom of an osteophyte is pain and stiffness.
Other symptoms depend on where in the body the osteophyte has formed.
They can include:
pins and needles, numbness or weakness in the arms and legs
lumps on joints like the fingers, big toe, heel and ankle"
Treatments for osteophytes,"Osteophytes only need to be treated if they cause problems such as pain or stiffness.
As osteophytes are closely linked to arthritis, the treatments you might need are the same as treatments for arthritis.
Treatment may include:
painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen
physiotherapy
losing weight if you're overweight
surgery, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement"
Bone loss before osteoporosis (osteopenia),"The stage before osteoporosis is called osteopenia. This is when a bone density scan shows you have lower bone density than the average for your age, but not low enough to be classed as osteoporosis.
Osteopenia does not always lead to osteoporosis. It depends on many factors.
If you have osteopenia, there are steps you can take to keep your bones healthy and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis.
Your doctor may also prescribe one of the bone-strengthening treatments that are given to people with osteoporosis, depending on how weak your bones are and your risk of breaking a bone."
Causes of osteoporosis,"Losing bone is a normal part of ageing, but some people lose bone much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of broken bones.
Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause. Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45) or they've had their ovaries removed.
However, osteoporosis can also affect men, younger women and children.
Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including:
taking high-dose steroid tablets for more than 3 months
other medical conditions – such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems
a family history of osteoporosis – particularly a hip fracture in a parent
long-term use of certain medicines that can affect bone strength or hormone levels, such as anti-oestrogen tablets that many women take after breast cancer
having or having had an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia
having a low body mass index (BMI)
not exercising regularly
heavy drinking and smoking
Read more about the causes of osteoporosis."
Diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia,"If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can work out your future risk of breaking a bone using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture.
Find out more about Frax, the online tool developed by Sheffield University
Bone density scan (DEXA scan)
They may also refer you for a bone density scan to measure your bone strength. It's a short, painless procedure that takes 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned.
Your bone density can be compared to that of a healthy young adult. 
The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score.
Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of:
above -1 SD is normal
between -1 and -2.5 SD shows bone loss and is defined as osteopenia
below -2.5 shows bone loss and is defined as osteoporosis"
Treating osteoporosis,"Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing broken bones, and taking medicine to strengthen your bones.
The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of breaking a bone in the future. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your bone density scan.
If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you.
Read more about how osteoporosis is treated."
Preventing osteoporosis,"If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include:
taking regular exercise to keep your bones as strong as possible
healthy eating – including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D
taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D
making lifestyle changes – such as giving up smoking and reducing your alcohol consumption
Read more about preventing osteoporosis."
Living with osteoporosis,"If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests.
To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using:
painkillers
hot and cold treatments, such as warm baths and cold packs
relaxation techniques and other ways to reduce pain
Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have.
You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition.
Read more about living with osteoporosis."
Osteoporosis support,"The Royal Osteoporosis Society is the UK's national charity for osteoporosis.
It has detailed information about osteoporosis prevention and treatment, and support groups throughout the UK.
Find an osteoporosis support group near you on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website
The Royal Osteoporosis Society's free telephone helpline may be particularly helpful if you're newly diagnosed with osteoporosis.
The helpline number is 0808 800 0035 and is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 12.30pm and 1.30pm to 5.00pm."
Check if you have otosclerosis,"Symptoms of otosclerosis include:
gradual hearing loss in 1 or both ears, often over several years
hearing ringing, buzzing or other noises in 1 or both ears (tinnitus)
dizziness
problems with your balance
Otosclerosis is a common cause of hearing loss in younger adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 30 to 50."
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have symptoms of otosclerosis, your GP will usually check inside your ears and may refer you to:
an audiologist for hearing tests
an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist who will look inside your ears, and may arrange a CT scan"
Treatment for otosclerosis,"The 2 main treatment options for otosclerosis are hearing aids or surgery.
Hearing aids work by making the sounds around you louder. They can help you hear easier, but they will not stop your hearing from getting worse.
You may also be offered surgery to remove one of the small bones (the stapes) in your affected ear or ears. If your stapes is removed, it will be replaced by a plastic or metal implant. Surgery is usually very successful at improving hearing.
You will usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) who will help you decide which treatment may be best for you."
Causes of otosclerosis,"Otosclerosis happens when a tiny bone inside your ear, called the stapes, joins (fuses) with other parts of the ear and stops you being able to hear properly.
It's not known why otosclerosis happens, but it may be passed on in families. You are more likely to get otosclerosis if a close relative has it."
The ovaries,"The ovaries are 2 almond-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. There's 1 on each side of the womb (uterus).
The ovaries have 2 main functions:
to release an egg approximately every 28 days as part of the menstrual cycle
to release the sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in reproduction
Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect 1."
Symptoms of an ovarian cyst,"An ovarian cyst usually only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large or twists and then blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.
In these cases, you may have:
pelvic pain – this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain
pain during sex
difficulty emptying your bowels
a frequent need to urinate
heavy periods, irregular periods or lighter periods than normal
bloating and a swollen tummy
feeling very full after only eating a little
difficulty getting pregnant – although fertility is usually unaffected by ovarian cysts"
Types of ovarian cyst,"The 2 main types of ovarian cyst are:
functional ovarian cysts – cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type
pathological ovarian cysts – cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth; these are much less common
Ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as endometriosis.
The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant).
Cancerous cysts are more common if you have been through the menopause.
Find out more about the causes of ovarian cysts"
Diagnosing ovarian cysts,"If a GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan, carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina.
If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or a GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health (gynaecologist).
If there's any concern that your cyst could be cancerous, the doctor will also arrange blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer.
But having high levels of these chemicals does not necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, such as:
endometriosis
a pelvic infection
fibroids
your period"
Treating ovarian cysts,"Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on:
its size and appearance
whether you have any symptoms
whether you have been through the menopause
In most cases, the cyst disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this.
If you are postmenopausal, there is a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer. Regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst.
Surgical treatment to remove the cysts may be needed if they're large, causing symptoms or potentially cancerous."
Ovarian cysts and fertility,"Ovarian cysts do not usually prevent you getting pregnant, although they can sometimes make it harder to conceive.
If you need an operation to remove your cysts, your surgeon will aim to preserve your fertility whenever possible.
This may mean removing just the cyst and leaving the ovaries intact, or only removing 1 ovary.
In some cases, surgery to remove both your ovaries may be necessary, in which case you'll no longer produce any eggs.
Make sure you talk to your surgeon about the potential effects on your fertility before your operation."
Check if it's ovulation pain,"Some women get ovulation pain.
It can affect anyone who ovulates, which is when an egg is released as part of your menstrual cycle.
Ovulation pain often:
feels like a dull pain or sharp sudden twinges
lasts from a few minutes to 1 or 2 days
happens about 14 days before a period
only affects 1 side of your tummy at a time
switches sides each time, depending on which ovary releases an egg
You may also have a little vaginal bleeding or discharge during ovulation."
Causes of ovulation pain,"Ovulation pain is caused by the ovary releasing the egg.
There are some conditions that may cause a similar pain.
These include:
conditions that affect the womb or ovaries such as endometriosis and ovarian cysts
some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia
scar tissue (adhesions) from surgery you've had near the ovaries, such as a caesarean section
an ectopic pregnancy"
Treatment for ovulation pain,"If ovulation is the only cause of your pain and it's not severe, a warm bath or painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen may be all you need.
A GP may advise contraception to stop you from ovulating, such as the contraceptive pill or a contraceptive implant.
If a GP thinks something else is causing the pain, they may refer you for tests or to see a specialist. Treatment will depend on what the cause is."
How a pacemaker works,"A pacemaker is a small device about the size of a matchbox or smaller that weighs 20 to 50g. 
It consists of a pulse generator, which has a battery and a tiny computer circuit, and 1 or more wires known as pacing leads, which attach to your heart.
The pulse generator emits electrical impulses through the wires to your heart. The rate at which the electrical impulses are sent out is called the pacing rate.
Almost all modern pacemakers work on demand. This means they can be programmed to adjust the discharge rate in response to your body's needs.
If the pacemaker senses that your heart has missed a beat or is beating too slowly, it sends signals at a steady rate. 
If it senses that your heart is beating normally by itself, it does not send out any signals.
Most pacemakers have a special sensor that recognises body movement or your breathing rate.
This allows them to speed up the discharge rate when you're active. Doctors describe this as rate responsive."
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs),"An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device similar to a pacemaker.
It sends a larger electrical shock to the heart that essentially ""reboots"" it to get it pumping again.
Some devices contain both a pacemaker and an ICD.
ICDs are often used as a preventative treatment for people thought to be at risk of cardiac arrest at some point in the future.
If the ICD senses the heart is beating at a potentially dangerous abnormal rate, it'll deliver an electrical shock to the heart. 
This often helps return the heart to a normal rhythm.
A conventional ICD has a pacing lead that's implanted along a vein (transvenously).
There's also a newer type of ICD where the pacing lead is implanted under the skin (subcutaneously)."
Why do I need a pacemaker?,"The heart is essentially a pump made of muscle, which is controlled by electrical signals.
These signals can become disrupted for several reasons, which can lead to a number of potentially dangerous heart conditions, such as:
an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia)
an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
heart block (where your heart beats irregularly because the electrical signals that control your heartbeat aren't transmitted properly)
cardiac arrest (when a problem with the heart's electrical signals cause the heart to stop beating altogether)
Read more about why you might need a pacemaker."
How is a pacemaker fitted?,"Having a pacemaker implanted is a relatively straightforward process.
It's usually carried out under local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure.
The generator is usually placed under the skin near the collarbone on the left side of the chest.
The generator is attached to a wire that's guided through a blood vessel to the heart.
The procedure usually takes about an hour, and most people are able to leave hospital on the same day or a day after surgery.
Read more about how a pacemaker is fitted."
After pacemaker surgery,"You should be able to return to normal physical activities soon after surgery. 
As a precaution, it's usually recommended that strenuous activities are avoided for around 4 to 6 weeks after having a pacemaker fitted.
After this, you should be able to do most activities and sports.
You'll be able to feel the pacemaker, but you'll soon get used to it. It may seem a bit heavy at first and may feel uncomfortable when you lie in certain positions.
You'll need to attend regular check-ups to make sure your pacemaker is working properly. Most pacemakers store information about your natural heart rhythms.
When you have follow-up appointments, your doctor can retrieve this information and use it to check how well your heart and the pacemaker are working.
Read more about recovering from pacemaker surgery."
Using electrical equipment,"Anything that produces a strong electromagnetic field, like an induction hob, can interfere with a pacemaker.
But most common household electrical equipment, such as hairdryers and microwave ovens, won't be a problem as long as you use them more than 15cm (6 inches) away from your pacemaker.
If you have an induction hob, keep a distance of at least 60cm (2ft) between the stove top and your pacemaker.
If this is a problem, you may want to consider replacing the appliance with something more suitable.
If you feel dizzy or your heart beating faster while using an electrical appliance, simply move away from it to allow your heartbeat to return to normal."
Safety,"Having a pacemaker implanted is usually a very safe procedure with a low risk of complications.
The biggest concern is the pacemaker losing its ability to control the heartbeat, either because it malfunctions, or the wire moves out of the correct position.
It's sometimes possible to reprogramme the pacemaker using wireless signals.
But further surgery may be needed if the pacemaker moves out of position.
Read more about the risks of having a pacemaker."
Alternatives to a pacemaker,"In some cases, it may be possible to control an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) without having a pacemaker fitted.
For example, atrial fibrillation can sometimes be treated with medication or a procedure called catheter ablation.
But not all people with an arrhythmia can be treated in this way, and in many cases a pacemaker is considered to be the most effective option.
If your cardiologist recommends having a pacemaker fitted, ask them why they think it's the best option and discuss any possible alternative treatments you could have."
New technology,"A new, smaller pacemaker about the size of a pill has been developed and is currently being tested in a global clinical trial.
The new device uses wireless technology and can be implanted directly into the heart, where it delivers electrical impulses from an electrode.
This means a pacing lead is not required, which has the benefits of lowering the risk of infection and shortening the recovery time associated with implanting traditional pacemakers."
Symptoms of Paget's disease of bone,"Paget's disease of bone can affect 1 bone or several bones. Commonly affected areas include the pelvis, spine and skull.
Symptoms can include:
bone or joint pain
skin feeling warm over the affected bone
changes in bone shape
a shooting pain that travels along or across the body, numbness and tingling (peripheral neuropathy), or balance problems
But in many cases there are no symptoms and the condition is only found during tests carried out for another reason.
Read more about the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone."
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you have:
persistent bone or joint pain
deformities in any of your bones
symptoms of a nerve problem, such as numbness, tingling or balance problems
Your GP can organise tests to check your bones and look for problems such as Paget's disease of bone.
Read more about how Paget's disease of bone is diagnosed."
Causes of Paget's disease of bone,"Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin – old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling.
2 cells are responsible for this:
osteoclasts – cells that absorb old bone
osteoblasts – cells that make new bone
In Paget's disease of bone, something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual.
The osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly, but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal.
It's not clear what triggers this, but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition."
Treatments for Paget's disease of bone,"There's currently no cure for Paget's disease of bone, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms.
If you do not have any symptoms, your doctor may suggest keeping an eye on your condition and delaying treatment until any problems occur.
The main treatments are:
bisphosphonate medication – medicines that help control bone regeneration and are used to control pain
supportive therapies – including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and devices such as walking sticks or shoe inserts
surgery – this may be needed if further problems develop, such as fractures, deformities or severe joint damage
Ensuring you get enough calcium and vitamin D can also help. Some people may need to take supplements.
Read more about how Paget's disease of bone is treated."
Further problems caused by Paget's disease of bone,"Paget's disease of bone can sometimes lead to further, potentially serious problems.
These include:
fragile bones that break more easily than normal
osteoarthritis, which causes painful and stiff joints
enlarged or misshapen bones
permanent hearing loss (if the skull is affected)
heart problems
in rare cases, bone cancer
Read more about possible complications of Paget's disease of bone."
Other types of Paget's disease,"There are several other types of Paget's disease that are not related to Paget's disease of bone.
These include:
Paget's disease of the nipple or breast – a rare type of breast cancer
Paget's disease of the penis – a rare type of penile cancer
Paget's disease of the vulva – a rare type of vulval cancer
The general term ""Paget's disease"" is sometimes used to refer to Paget's disease of bone."
Symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple,"Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola.
The affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated.
Credit:
The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over.
If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor.
Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer.
Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump.
However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer.
This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread."
Causes of Paget's disease of the nipple,"The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown. Some women appear to be more at risk of developing breast cancer, but not specifically Paget's disease. There are no known causes that lead to a specific type of breast cancer.
In terms of risk factors, you're more likely to develop breast cancer if you:
are older – the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age
have close relatives with breast cancer
have had breast cancer before
have had a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease before – certain types of benign breast disease may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but this is only seen in a very small number of women
are overweight or living with obesity, particularly if you've been through the menopause (you can use the BMI calculator to check if you're a healthy weight)
drink a lot of alcohol – your risk can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink
Read more about the risk factors for breast cancer."
Diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple,"You should see your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola.
As Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.
Also see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out.
A biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous.
If the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray) to investigate further.
Read more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple."
Treating Paget's disease of the nipple,"Surgery is the main treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple. Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision).
If the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast.
You may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of:
chemotherapy – where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells
radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells
targeted or hormone therapy – which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body
If Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery.
Read more about treating Paget's disease of the nipple."
"Reducing the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple","Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and making sure you exercise regularly, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer.
Breast cancer screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. In the UK, the NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women aged 50 to 70.
In some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a study looking at whether the age range for breast screening should be extended.
Read more about reducing the risks of breast cancer."
Causes of testicle pain,"Sudden, severe testicle pain can be caused by twisting of the testicle (testicular torsion).
This is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of the testicle if it's not treated quickly.
Less serious causes of testicle pain include:
an infection (epididymitis)
an injury
an inguinal hernia
a build-up of fluid (cyst)
swollen veins in the testicles (varicocele)
Pain by itself is not usually a sign of testicular cancer. Cancer usually causes other symptoms like a lump or swelling in your testicle.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your pain. Get medical help if you're worried."

Why pancreas transplants are carried out,"A pancreas transplant allows people with type 1 diabetes (insulin-treated diabetes) to produce insulin again.
It's not a routine treatment because it has risks, and treatment with insulin injections is often effective.
A pancreas transplant is usually only considered if:
you also have severe kidney disease – a pancreas transplant may be carried out at the same time as a kidney transplant in these cases
you have severe episodes of dangerously low blood sugar levels that happen without warning and are not controlled with insulin
If your doctor thinks you might benefit from a pancreas transplant, you'll need to have a detailed assessment to check whether you're healthy enough to have one before you're placed on a waiting list.
Read more about who can have a pancreas transplant and being on the pancreas transplant waiting list."
What happens during a pancreas transplant,"A pancreas transplant needs to be carried out as soon as possible after a donor pancreas becomes available.
The operation is performed under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep.
A cut is made along your tummy. The donor pancreas (and donor kidney, if you're having a kidney transplant at the same time) is then placed inside and attached to nearby blood vessels and your bowel.
The new pancreas should start producing insulin straight away. Your old, damaged pancreas will be left in place and will continue to produce important digestive juices after the transplant.
Find out more about how a pancreas transplant is performed"
Recovering from a pancreas transplant,"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for around 1 or 2 weeks after a pancreas transplant.
Most people are able to get back to their normal activities within a few months.
Your transplant team can give you advice about how long you need to avoid certain activities during your recovery.
You'll have regular check-ups with your transplant team after the transplant.
You'll need to take medicines called immunosuppressants for the rest of your life. These medicines lower the risk of rejection, when your body recognises your new pancreas as foreign and attacks it.
Find out more about recovering from a pancreas transplant"
Risks of a pancreas transplant,"A pancreas transplant is a complex and risky procedure.
Possible problems include:
your immune system recognising the transplanted pancreas as foreign and attacking it (rejection)
blood clots forming in the blood vessels supplying the donor pancreas
short-term inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), usually just after transplantation
side effects from the immunosuppressant medicine, such as an increased chance of catching certain infections, developing high blood pressure, and weakened bones (osteoporosis)
Many of these problems are treatable, although sometimes it may be necessary to remove the donor pancreas.
Find out more about the risks associated with a pancreas transplant"
Outlook after a pancreas transplant,"The outlook for people with a pancreas transplant is usually good. Most people live for many years, or even decades, after a pancreas transplant.
More than 9 out of 10 people are alive 1 year after having a pancreas transplant, or a pancreas and kidney transplant at the same time.
And almost 9 out of 10 people are alive 5 years after a pancreas transplant, or pancreas and kidney transplant.
The donor pancreas can be removed if it stops working, and it may be possible to put you back on the waiting list for another transplant."

Joining the NHS Organ Donor Register is quick and simple.
You can remove yourself from the register at any time, and you can specify what you're willing to donate."
Symptoms of panic disorder,"Anxiety
Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe, and can include feelings of worry and fear. Panic is the most severe form of anxiety.
You may start to avoid certain situations because you fear they'll trigger another attack.
This can create a cycle of living ""in fear of fear"". It can add to your sense of panic and may cause you to have more attacks.
Panic attacks
During a panic attack you get a rush of intense mental and physical symptoms. It can come on very quickly and for no apparent reason.
A panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.
Symptoms include:
a racing heartbeat
feeling faint
sweating
nausea
chest pain
shortness of breath
trembling
hot flushes
chills
shaky limbs
a choking sensation
dizziness
numbness or pins and needles
dry mouth
a feeling of dread or a fear of dying
a churning stomach
a tingling in your fingers
feeling like you're not connected to your body
Most panic attacks last between 5 and 20 minutes. Some have been reported to last up to an hour.
The number of attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.
Although panic attacks are frightening, they're not dangerous. An attack will not cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely you'll be admitted to hospital if you have one.
Be aware that most of these symptoms can also be symptoms of other conditions or problems, so you may not always be experiencing a panic attack.
For example, you may have a racing heartbeat if you have very low blood pressure."
When to get help,"See a GP if you've been experiencing symptoms of panic disorder.
They'll ask you to describe your symptoms, how often you get them, and how long you have had them.
They may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.
You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you have regular and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least a month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks."
Treatments for panic disorder,"Treatment aims to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease your symptoms.
Talking therapies and medicine are the main treatments for panic disorder. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms."
Things you can try yourself,"What to do during a panic attack
The next time you feel a panic attack coming on:
stay where you are, if possible
breathe slowly and deeply
remind yourself that the attack will pass
focus on positive, peaceful and relaxing images
remember it's not life threatening
Preventing a further attack
It may help to:
read a self-help book for anxiety based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – ask your GP to recommend one
try activities like yoga and pilates, to help you relax
learn breathing exercises for stress to help ease symptoms
do regular physical exercise to reduce stress and tension
avoid sugary food and drinks, caffeine and alcohol, and stop smoking, as they can all make attacks worse"
Complications of panic disorder,"Panic disorder is treatable so it's best to get medical help as soon as you can.
If you do not get medical help, panic disorder can escalate and become very difficult to cope with.
You're more at risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias, or an alcohol or drug problem.
Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. The law requires you to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability.
Visit GOV.UK for further information about driving with a disability or health condition."
Causes,"As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder is not fully understood.
But it's thought to be linked to a combination of things, including:
a traumatic or very stressful life experience, such as bereavement
having a close family member with panic disorder
an imbalance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain"
Panic disorder in children,"If your child has the signs and symptoms of panic disorder, they should see a GP.
After taking a detailed medical history the GP will carry out a thorough physical examination to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.
They may refer your child to a specialist for further assessment and treatment. The specialist may recommend a course of CBT for your child.

Symptoms of paralysis,"You may have paralysis if:
you cannot move some or all of your face or body
your face or body is weak or floppy
your face or body is numb, painful or tingles all the time
your face or body is stiff with muscle spasms and twitches
This can start suddenly or gradually, or come and go."
Causes of paralysis,"Paralysis can be a symptom of many different conditions that affect the muscles and nerves.
Common causes of paralysis include:
a transient ischaemic attack (TIA or ""mini-stroke"") or stroke (paralysis in 1 half of the face with arm weakness)
a head injury
a spinal cord (back) injury
Bell's palsy (paralysis in 1 half of the face)
multiple sclerosis
Sometimes paralysis can be temporary, like having sleep paralysis, or long-term, like muscular dystrophy.
It can also be caused by a brain tumour or certain types of cancer like head or neck cancer."
Treatment for paralysis,"Treatment for paralysis will depend on what's causing it.
Temporary paralysis may go away on its own without medical treatment.
Things that can help people with paralysis include:
physiotherapy to maintain strength and muscle mass
occupational therapy to adapt to everyday tasks like getting dressed
medicines to relieve problems such as pain, stiffness and muscle spasms"
Symptoms of Parkinson's disease,"The main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are:
involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor)
slow movement
stiff and inflexible muscles
A person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms.
These include:
depression and anxiety
balance problems (this may increase the chances of a fall)
loss of sense of smell (anosmia)
problems sleeping (insomnia)
memory problems"
Seeking medical advice,"See a GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
They'll ask about the problems you're experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests.
Find out more about diagnosing Parkinson's disease"
Causes of Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.
Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible."
Who's affected,"Most people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although some people with the condition first experience symptoms when they're under 40.
Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women."
Treating Parkinson's disease,"Although there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible.
These include:
supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy
medication
in some cases, brain surgery
You may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild.
But you may need regular appointments with your specialist so your condition can be monitored."
Outlook,"As the condition progresses, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can get worse and it can become increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities without help.
Many people respond well to treatment and only experience mild to moderate disability, whereas the minority may not respond as well and can, in time, become more severely disabled.
Parkinson's disease does not directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections.
But with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson's disease now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.

Symptoms and features,"Babies with Patau's syndrome can have a wide range of health problems.
Their growth in the womb is often restricted, resulting in a low birth weight, and 8 out of 10 will be born with severe heart defects.
The brain often does not divide into 2 halves. This is known as holoprosencephaly.
When this happens, it can affect facial features and cause defects such as:
cleft lip and palate
an abnormally small eye or eyes (microphthalmia)
absence of 1 or both eyes (anophthalmia)
Other abnormalities of the face and head include:
smaller than normal head size (microcephaly)
ear malformations and deafness
Patau's syndrome can also cause other problems, such as:
an abdominal wall defect where the abdomen does not develop fully in the womb, resulting in the intestines being outside the body, covered only by a membrane – this is known as an exomphalos or omphalocoele
abnormal cysts in the kidneys
There may also be abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) and a rounded bottom to the feet, known as rocker-bottom feet."
Causes of Patau's syndrome,"Patau's syndrome happens by chance and is not caused by anything the parents have done.
Most cases do not run in families (they're not inherited). They happen randomly during conception, when the sperm and egg combine and the foetus starts to develop.
There's an error when the cells divide, resulting in an additional copy, or part of a copy, of chromosome 13, which severely affects the baby's development in the womb.
In many cases, the baby dies before reaching full term (miscarriage) or is dead at birth (stillbirth).
In most cases of Patau's syndrome, a baby has a whole extra copy of chromosome number 13 in their body's cells. This is sometimes known as trisomy 13 or simple trisomy 13.
In some cases of Patau's syndrome, genetic material is rearranged between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This is called a chromosomal translocation. Patau's syndrome that arises because of this can be inherited.
Sometimes only some cells have the extra copy of chromosome 13. This is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. Occasionally, only part of 1 chromosome 13 is extra (partial trisomy 13).
The symptoms and features of both mosaicism and partial trisomy tend to be less severe than in simple trisomy 13, resulting in more babies living longer.
Genetic Alliance UK has more information about chromosome disorders"
Screening for Patau's syndrome,"You'll be offered a screening test for Patau's syndrome, as well as Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18), from 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.
The test assesses your chances of having a baby with these syndromes.
The screening test offered at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy is called the combined test because it involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan.
If the screening tests show you have a higher chance of having a baby with Patau's syndrome, you'll be offered a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT).
This is a blood test that can give you a more accurate screening result and help you to decide whether to have a diagnostic test or not. It's available free on the NHS.
A diagnostic test will check the chromosomes in a sample of cells taken from your baby and helps to find out for certain if they have Patau's syndrome.
Two techniques can be used to obtain the cell sample: amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). 
These are invasive tests to remove a sample of tissue or fluid so it can be tested for the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 13.
If you're not able to have the combined screening test, you'll be offered a scan that looks for physical abnormalities, including those found in Patau's syndrome.
This is sometimes called the mid-pregnancy scan and is carried out when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant.
Find out more about screening tests for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome"
Treating and managing Patau's syndrome,"There's no specific treatment for Patau's syndrome. As a result of the severe health problems a newborn baby with the syndrome will have, doctors usually focus on minimising discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed.
For the small number of babies with Patau's syndrome who survive beyond the first few days of life, their care will depend on their specific symptoms and needs.
If your baby is diagnosed with Patau's syndrome, either before birth or shortly afterwards, you'll be offered counselling and support."
Genetic testing for parents,"Both parents will need to have their chromosomes analysed if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome caused by a chromosomal translocation.
Genetic testing is carried out to help parents plan for future pregnancies, rather than as part of the decision-making process for the current pregnancy.
The test results will allow a more accurate assessment to be made of the likelihood of the syndrome affecting future pregnancies.
Other family members may also be affected and should be tested.

Information about your child
If your child has Patau's syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Why peak flow is measured,"By measuring how fast you're able to breathe out, your peak flow score can indicate whether your airways are narrowed.
This could be a sign that you have asthma, although other tests such as spirometry will often be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
If you've already been diagnosed with asthma, measuring your peak flow regularly can be a useful way of monitoring your condition.
Your score can show whether or not your condition is getting worse. It can also check if your medication is working, and indicate whether you're having an asthma attack.
Measuring your peak flow before and after exposure to a possible asthma trigger, such as something you're allergic to or a substance you're exposed to at work, may also show if anything in particular causes your symptoms."
How to measure your peak flow,"The first time your peak flow is measured, you'll be taught how to do it by a doctor or nurse. After this they may advise you to carry out the test regularly at home using your own peak flow meter.
To measure your peak flow:
find a comfortable position, either sitting or standing – do this the same way every time
push the pointer back to the first line of the scale nearest the mouthpiece
hold the peak flow meter so it's horizontal and make sure that your fingers are not obstructing the measurement scale
breathe in as deeply as you can and place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece
breathe out as quickly and as hard as you can
when you've finished breathing out, make a note of your reading
This should be repeated 3 times, and the highest of the 3 measurements should be recorded as your peak flow score.
If you're monitoring your asthma at home, you may have a diary or chart to record your score.
Download a peak flow diary (PDF only, 1.06MB) from the Asthma + Lung UK website"
Your peak flow score,"Your peak flow score – also known as your peak expiratory flow (PEF) – will be displayed on the side of your peak flow meter. This is given in litres of air breathed out per minute (l/min).
What's considered a normal score depends on your age, height and sex. Ask your GP or asthma nurse for more information on what would be considered a normal score for you.
To help diagnose asthma, your result can be compared to what would usually be expected for someone of your age, height and sex.
A significant difference between your score and a normal score, or a difference in your scores in the morning and evening or when your symptoms are good and bad, may suggest you have asthma.
If you're monitoring your asthma at home, your score should be compared to your best result at a point when your condition was well controlled.
A big difference between your current and best score could be a sign that your condition is becoming poorly controlled or that you're having an asthma attack."
What to do if your peak flow is low,"If you have a personal asthma action plan, it might say what you should do when your peak flow score falls to a certain level.
You may just need to use one of your inhalers, or you may need to seek medical help. See treating asthma and what to do if you have an asthma attack for more information.
Speak to your GP or asthma nurse if you've been diagnosed with asthma and don't have a personal action plan, or if you're concerned about your peak flow score and don't know what to do.
You may be given a personal action plan at your appointment that you can fill in with your doctor or nurse, or you can:
Download an asthma action plan from Asthma + Lung UK
Your asthma action plan should be reviewed and updated at least once a year at your asthma review with a GP or asthma nurse.
Take your plan with you to every asthma appointment – including any A&E or consultant visits – so that if there are any changes, your plan can be updated."
Symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"PID often does not cause any obvious symptoms.
Most symptoms are mild and may include 1 or more of the following:
pain around the pelvis or lower tummy
discomfort or pain during sex that's felt deep inside the pelvis
pain when peeing
bleeding between periods and after sex
heavy periods
painful periods
unusual vaginal discharge, especially if it's yellow, green or smelly
A few people become very ill with:
severe pain in the tummy
a high temperature (fever)
feeling and being sick"
When to seek medical advice,"It's important to visit a GP or a sexual health clinic if you experience any symptoms of PID.
If you have severe pain, you should seek urgent medical attention from your GP or local A&E department. 
Delaying treatment for PID or having repeated episodes of PID can increase your risk of serious and long-term complications.
There's no simple test to diagnose PID. Diagnosis is based on your symptoms and the finding of tenderness during a vaginal (internal) examination.
Swabs will be taken from your vagina and the neck of the womb (cervix), but negative swabs do not rule out PID."
Causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that's spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.
Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. In many cases, it's caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea.
Another type of STI called mycoplasma genitalium is thought to be increasingly responsible for cases of PID.
In many other cases, it's caused by bacteria that normally live in the vagina."
Treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"If diagnosed at an early stage, PID can be treated with a course of antibiotics, which usually lasts for 14 days.
You'll be given a mixture of antibiotics to cover the most likely infections, and often an injection as well as tablets.
It's important to complete the whole course and avoid having sexual intercourse during this time to help ensure the infection clears.
Your recent sexual partners should also be treated for any sexually transmitted infections that may have caused your PID. This will help stop it coming back or spreading to other people."
Complications,"The fallopian tubes can become scarred and narrowed if they're affected by PID. This can make it difficult for eggs to pass from the ovaries into the womb.
This can increase your chances of a pregnancy that grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes (ectopic pregnancy). This type of pregnancy cannot be saved and can cause life-threatening problems.
If you keep getting PID or treatment is delayed, it can increase your risk of infertility."
Preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"You can reduce your risk of PID by always using barrier contraception, such as condoms, with a new sexual partner until they have had a sexual health check.
Chlamydia is very common and most people do not have any symptoms.
If you're worried you may have an STI, visit your local genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic for advice.
If you need an invasive gynaecological procedure, such as insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) or an abortion, have a check-up beforehand."
Symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse,"Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms include:
a feeling of heaviness around your lower tummy and genitals
a dragging discomfort inside your vagina
feeling like there's something coming down into your vagina – it may feel like sitting on a small ball
feeling or seeing a bulge or lump in or coming out of your vagina
discomfort or numbness during sex
problems peeing – such as feeling like your bladder is not emptying fully, needing to go to the toilet more often, or leaking a small amount of pee when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence)
Sometimes pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms and is found during an internal examination carried out for another reason, such as cervical screening."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina.
What happens at your appointment
Your doctor will ask if they can do an internal pelvic examination.
For this you'll need to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed.
Your doctor will then feel for any lumps in your pelvic area and inside your vagina.
They may gently put an instrument called a speculum into your vagina to hold the walls of it open so they can see if there's a prolapse.
Sometimes they'll ask you to lie on your left-hand side and examine you in that position to get a better view of the prolapse.
You can ask for this examination to be done by a female doctor and, if you like, bring someone you trust along with you for support.
Further tests
If you have problems with your bladder, a GP may refer you to hospital for further tests.
These may include:
a urine test to look for an infection
inserting a small tube into your bladder to look for any problems"
Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse,"If you do not have any symptoms, or the prolapse is mild and not bothering you, you may not need medical treatment.
But making some lifestyle changes will probably still help.
These include:
losing weight if you're overweight
avoiding heavy lifting
preventing or treating constipation
If the prolapse is more severe or your symptoms are affecting your daily life, there are several further treatment options to consider.
These include:
pelvic floor exercises
hormone treatment
vaginal pessaries
surgery
The recommended treatment will depend on the type and severity of the prolapse, your symptoms and your overall health.
You and your doctor will decide together what's the best option for you."
Causes of pelvic organ prolapse,"Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs in place firmly.
A number of things can weaken your pelvic floor and increase your chance of developing pelvic organ prolapse.
These include:
pregnancy and childbirth – especially if you had a long, difficult birth, or if you gave birth to a large baby or multiple babies
getting older and going through the menopause
being overweight
having long-term constipation or a long-term health condition that causes you to cough and strain
having a hysterectomy
a job that requires a lot of heavy lifting
Some health conditions can also make a prolapse more likely, including:
joint hypermobility syndrome
Marfan syndrome
Ehlers-Danlos syndromes"
Types of prolapse,"The 4 main types of prolapse are:
the bladder bulging into the front wall of the vagina (anterior prolapse)
the womb bulging or hanging down into the vagina (uterine prolapse)
the top of the vagina sagging down – this happens to some women after they have had surgery to remove their womb
the bowel bulging forward into the back wall of the vagina (posterior wall prolapse)
It's possible to have more than 1 of these at the same time.
Pelvic organ prolapse will usually be classified on a scale of 1 to 4 to show how severe it is, with 4 being a severe prolapse."
Symptoms of pelvic pain,"Pelvic pain varies. It may affect a small area around your pelvis (your lower tummy) or the whole area.
Types of pelvic pain include:
a sharp, stabbing or burning pain that happens suddenly
a pain that comes on slowly but does not go away
a dull or heavy ache, or feeling of pressure
a twisted or knotted feeling
a cramping or throbbing pain, which may come and go
pain only when you’re doing something, like exercising, having sex, or peeing"
Common causes of pelvic pain,"There are lots of causes of pelvic pain. It might be caused by an infection or a condition affecting one of the organs in the pelvic area, such as the bowel or bladder.
Common causes include:
constipation or irritable bowel syndrome
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Most causes of pelvic pain are not serious. But there a few conditions that cause pelvic pain and need emergency treatment, such as appendicitis and peritonitis.
But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Pelvic pain in women
Pelvic pain is more common in women and common causes include:
period pain
conditions affecting female reproductive organs, such as an ovarian cyst or endometriosis
pelvic pain in pregnancy
Rarely it could be something more serious, like an ectopic pregnancy, womb cancer or ovarian cancer.
Pelvic pain in men
Pelvic pain can sometimes be caused by conditions affecting the prostate, such as prostatitis."
Treatments for pelvic pain,"Any treatment for pelvic pain will depend on the cause.
A GP might suggest treatments such as:
antibiotics
painkillers
physiotherapy, such as exercises for the pelvic floor muscles
hormone treatments
They may refer you for tests or to a specialist if they do not know what is causing your pain."
Check if you have pemphigus vulgaris,"Pemphigus vulgaris causes blisters that burst easily and leave very sore patches.
The most common area affected is inside the mouth and throat, which can make swallowing painful.
Credit:
Many people also get blisters on their skin. These usually appear a few months after the mouth is affected.
Credit:
The blisters and sore areas can cover a large area of the body. Sometimes they can also affect the eyes, genitals or anus.
Credit:"
Treatments for pemphigus vulgaris,"If a GP thinks you could have pemphigus vulgaris, they can refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) for tests and treatment.
Blisters caused by pemphigus vulgaris usually come and go over time. There's no cure, but treatment can help.
The main treatments are:
steroid tablets
other medicines such as azathioprine, methotrexate and rituximab
It usually takes a few weeks for the blisters to heal. Once this happens, you'll probably need treatment for several years to help stop the blisters coming back.
It may be possible to stop treatment eventually. If the blisters come back, you may need to repeat treatment."
Things you can do if you have pemphigus vulgaris,"If you have pemphigus vulgaris, there are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms and reduce the risk of further problems.
Do
clean your teeth using a soft toothbrush and mint-free toothpaste
use antiseptic or painkilling (anaesthetic) mouthwash (try to avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol)
keep any sore patches clean to reduce the risk of infection
have regular dental check-ups
Don’t
do not eat spicy, acidic or hard foods if you have blisters in your mouth
do not do activities that could damage your skin (such as contact sports) if you have blisters on your skin"
Complications of pemphigus vulgaris,"Pemphigus vulgaris can lead to other problems, such as:
blisters and sore patches becoming infected, which can cause life-threatening problems such as sepsis
weight loss and malnutrition because of pain when eating and drinking
tooth decay and gum disease because it can be painful to look after your teeth and gums
pain during sex and pain when peeing or pooing (if your genitals or anus are affected)
You'll have regular check-ups to look for these problems and may be referred to other specialists (such as a dietitian) if needed.
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
your blisters or sore patches are very painful or feel hot
there is yellow or green pus coming from your blisters or sore patches
These are signs of an infection, which needs to be treated quickly.
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."
Causes of pemphigus vulgaris,"Pemphigus vulgaris is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body’s defence against infection.
Instead of attacking germs, something goes wrong with the immune system and it attacks the skin by mistake. This damages the skin and causes blisters to appear.
It’s not clear why this happens. It’s not passed on in families and it’s not caused by an infection, so it cannot spread to other people."
Support if you have pemphigus vulgaris,"Living with pemphigus vulgaris can be very difficult.
As well as support from your care team, it may help to get information and support from groups and charities such as:
Pemphigus Vulgaris Network – a UK support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris
PEM Friends – a UK support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris and related conditions
International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation – a global support group for people with pemphigus vulgaris and related conditions"
Check if you have pericarditis,"The main symptom of pericarditis is chest pain.
The chest pain usually:
feels sharp or stabbing
spreads to your shoulders, arms or tummy
gets worse when you breathe in deeply, swallow, cough or lie down (especially when you lie down on your left side)
gets better when you lean forward
You may also feel hot and shivery or have a high temperature, cough or painful joints.
If you get pericarditis, it often follows a viral infection like a cold or flu."
Tests for pericarditis,"A GP will listen to your heart to check for pericarditis. This is because it can change the sound your heart makes.
To confirm pericarditis, the GP may:
do some blood tests
refer you for a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram in hospital
ECGs are safe and painless, and some GPs can do them at the surgery."
Treatment for pericarditis,"Treatment for pericarditis will depend on what's causing it. You may be given anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, to help ease symptoms like pain.
Sitting up or leaning forward can also help ease the pain.
You may need other treatment. For example, a GP may prescribe medicines such as:
colchicine – if anti-inflammatory painkillers do not work or pericarditis keeps coming back
steroids – if colchicine does not work
antibiotics – if pericarditis is caused by a bacterial infection
Most people feel better within a few weeks."
Causes of pericarditis,"Your heart has a protective fluid-filled sac around it called the pericardium.
In pericarditis, the pericardium gets inflamed, and blood or fluid can leak into it.
It's difficult to confirm the exact cause of pericarditis, but it's usually a viral infection, such as a cold or flu."
When do periods start?,"Periods usually begin at around the age of 12, although some girls will start them earlier or later.
A delay in starting periods isn't usually a cause for concern. Most girls will be having regular periods by age 16 to 18.
Read more about early or delayed puberty."
Sanitary products,"Sanitary products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of sanitary products are:
sanitary pads
tampons
menstrual cups
Sanitary pads
Sanitary pads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood.
Pads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is.
You can also get reusable washable pads.
Pantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of sanitary pad that can be used on days when your period is very light.
Tampons
Tampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body.
There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it.
Tampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly.
It is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood.
For more information, read:
Can a tampon get lost inside me?
What if I forget to remove my tampon?
Menstrual cups
Menstrual cups are an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina.
Menstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most sanitary pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again.
Period underwear
Period underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as sanitary pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused."
PMS (premenstrual syndrome),"Changes in your body's hormone levels before your period can cause physical and emotional changes.
This is known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or PMT (premenstrual tension).
There are many possible symptoms of PMS, but typical symptoms include:
feeling bloated
breast tenderness
mood swings
feeling irritable
spotty skin
low sex drive (loss of libido)
These symptoms usually improve when your period starts and disappear a few days afterwards. Not all women who have periods get PMS."
Getting pregnant,"Working out when you can get pregnant – your fertile time – can be difficult. It's around the time you ovulate, which is about 12 to 16 days before the start of your next period.
But sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to 7 days before ovulation occurs. This means your fertile time extends back earlier in your cycle.
You can calculate when your period will start and your peak ovulation times using an online period calendar.
You cannot get pregnant if you do not ovulate. Some hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch and contraceptive injection, work by preventing ovulation.
Read more about periods and fertility in the menstrual cycle, infertility, contraception and trying to get pregnant."
Changes in your periods,"Your periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated.
You can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic.
Bleeding between periods, bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause needs to be checked by a doctor.
It might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer.
You could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods.
They will investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment.
Read more about stopped or missed periods."
When do periods stop?,"Your periods will continue until you reach the menopause, which usually happens when you are in your mid-40s to mid-50s. In the UK the average age of menopause is 51.
Your periods will not usually stop suddenly when you go through the menopause. They may start to become less frequent over a few months or years before stopping altogether."
Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease,"Many people with PAD have no symptoms. However, some develop a painful ache in their legs when they walk, which usually disappears after a few minutes' rest. The medical term for this is ""intermittent claudication"".
The pain can range from mild to severe, and usually goes away after a few minutes when you rest your legs.
Both legs are often affected at the same time, although the pain may be worse in 1 leg.
Other symptoms of PAD can include:
hair loss on your legs and feet
numbness or weakness in the legs
brittle, slow-growing toenails
ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs, which do not heal
changing skin colour on your legs, such as turning paler than usual or blue – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin
shiny skin
in men, erectile dysfunction
the muscles in your legs shrinking (wasting)
The symptoms of PAD often develop slowly, over time. If your symptoms develop quickly, or get suddenly worse, it could be a sign of a serious problem requiring immediate treatment."
When to see a GP,"You should see a GP if you experience recurring leg pain when exercising.
Many people mistakenly think this is just part of growing older, but there's no reason why an otherwise healthy person should experience leg pain.
PAD is usually diagnosed through a physical examination by a GP, and by comparing the blood pressure in your arm and your ankle.
A difference between the 2 may indicate PAD and is called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).
Read about diagnosing PAD."
Causes of peripheral arterial disease,"PAD is a form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it affects the blood vessels.
It's usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the walls of the leg arteries. The fatty deposits (atheroma) are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances.
The build-up of fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts blood flow to the legs. This process is called atherosclerosis.
There are certain things that can increase your chances of developing PAD and other forms of CVD, including:
smoking – the most significant risk factor
type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes
high blood pressure (hypertension)
high cholesterol
growing older"
Treating peripheral arterial disease,"PAD is largely treated through lifestyle changes and medication.
Exercising regularly and not smoking are the main lifestyle changes that can ease the symptoms of PAD and reduce the chances of it getting worse. It's also important to:
eat a healthy diet
lose weight, if you're overweight or obese
moderate your consumption of alcohol
Read about:
Stopping smoking
Exercise
The underlying causes should also be treated, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Medicine and, in some cases, surgery can be used to improve the blood flow in your legs.
With treatment, most people's symptoms remain stable and some people may experience an improvement in their pain.
If treatment is unsuccessful, there's a risk of potentially serious complications.
Read about treating PAD."
Complications of peripheral arterial disease,"PAD is not immediately life-threatening, but the process of atherosclerosis that causes it can lead to serious and potentially fatal problems.
Coronary heart disease (CHD)
The blockages in the arteries in the legs can also affect other areas of your body, such as the arteries supplying the heart and brain. 
This means that having PAD makes you more likely to develop another form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as:
coronary heart disease
stroke
heart attack
angina
Critical limb ischaemia (CLI)
If the blood flow to the legs becomes severely restricted, critical limb ischaemia (CLI) can develop. CLI is an extremely serious complication that can be challenging to treat.
Symptoms of CLI include:
a severe burning pain in your legs and feet that continues even when you're resting
your skin turning pale, shiny, smooth and dry
wounds and ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs that do not heal
loss of muscle mass in your legs
the skin on your toes or lower limbs becoming cold and numb, turning red and then black, and/or beginning to swell and produce smelly pus, causing severe pain (gangrene) – changes in skin colour may be harder to see on brown and black skin
If you think you're developing symptoms of CLI, contact a GP immediately. If this is not possible call 111 or use 111 online.
An angioplasty or bypass graft is usually recommended if you have CLI, although these may not always be successful or possible. In a few cases, an amputation below the knee may be required."
The peripheral nervous system,"The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).
It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including:
sensory nerves – responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch
motor nerves – responsible for controlling muscles
autonomic nerves – responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function"
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy,"The main symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include:
numbness and tingling in the feet or hands
burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas
loss of balance and co-ordination
muscle weakness, especially in the feet
These symptoms are usually constant, but may come and go."
When to see a GP,"It's important to see a GP if you experience the early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
These include:
pain, tingling or loss of sensation in the feet
loss of balance or weakness
a cut or ulcer on your foot that's not getting better
It's also recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes, have regular check-ups.
A GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause.
You may be referred to hospital to see a neurologist, a specialist in health problems affecting the nervous system.
Generally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.

Causes of peripheral neuropathy,"In the UK diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.
Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves.
This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes.
For example, it can be caused by:
physical injury to the nerves
a viral infection, such as shingles
a side effect of certain medicines or drinking too much alcohol
People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed."
Treating peripheral neuropathy,"Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.
Not all of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated.
For example, if you have diabetes, it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol.
Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers often do not work.
If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually.
For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and walking aids."
Complications of peripheral neuropathy,"The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged.
Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time.
If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy is not treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected.
This can lead to gangrene if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the foot has to be amputated.
Peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy).
You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, a pacemaker.
Find out more about complications of peripheral neuropathy"
Different types of peripheral neuropathy,"Peripheral neuropathy may affect:
only 1 nerve (mononeuropathy)
several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex)
all the nerves in the body (polyneuropathy)
Polyneuropathy is the most common type and starts by affecting the longest nerves first, so symptoms typically begin in the feet.
Over time it gradually starts to affect shorter nerves, so feels as if it's spreading upwards, and later affects the hands."
Check if you have peritonitis,"Symptoms of peritonitis include:
tummy pain
a very high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery
a rapid heartbeat (your heart is beating more quickly than normal)
not being able to pee or peeing much less than normal
You might also have:
a lack of appetite and feel or be sick
a swollen tummy
Important
If you're having kidney dialysis treatment, the fluid in the collection bag might look cloudier than usual or contain white flecks."
Causes of peritonitis,"The lining of the tummy (peritoneum) covers internal organs like the kidneys, liver and bowel.
If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis, the internal organs it covers can also be damaged.
This most often happens because of things like:
a burst stomach ulcer
a burst appendix
digestive problems, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis
pancreatitis
surgery
injury to the stomach
pelvic inflammatory disease
cirrhosis
Rarely, if bacteria gets into peritoneal dialysis equipment used to treat people with kidney failure, this can cause infection."
Treatment for peritonitis,"If you're diagnosed with peritonitis, you'll need treatment in hospital to get rid of the infection.
Treatment usually involves being given antibiotics into a vein (intravenously).
If you have regular kidney dialysis, your doctor might discuss a different way of doing it until the peritonitis has been treated.
Help with eating during treatment
It can be difficult to digest food if you have peritonitis.
A feeding tube might be passed into your stomach through your nose or placed inside your stomach using keyhole surgery.
If a feeding tube cannot be used, liquid nutrients can be given directly into one of your veins.
Surgery for peritonitis
If part of your stomach lining has been seriously damaged by infection, you may need surgery to remove it.
Sometimes pus-filled swellings (abscesses) develop in the lining and need to be drained with a needle under local anaesthetic.
You might also need an operation to deal with the cause of the peritonitis. For example, a burst appendix will need to be removed."
Persistent trophoblastic disease,"In the UK, about 1 in 600 pregnancies are found to be a molar pregnancy, where the foetus and placenta don't form properly and a baby doesn't usually develop.
This usually results in the loss of the pregnancy (miscarriage).
In most molar pregnancies, any remaining abnormal tissue in the womb usually dies off.
But in a small proportion of women, the tissue can remain and grow further into the lining of the womb and, like a cancer, spread to other areas of the body.
This is known as persistent trophoblastic disease. Vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom.
Chemotherapy is usually used to treat persistent trophoblastic disease.
Treatment is successful in curing virtually all cases of persistent trophoblastic disease."
Choriocarcinoma,"Choriocarcinoma is a very rare type of cancer that occurs in around 1 in 50,000 pregnancies.
It can develop if the cells left behind after a pregnancy become cancerous.
This can happen after any pregnancy, but it's more likely after molar pregnancies.
It can happen after a:
normal birth
miscarriage
ectopic pregnancy
abortion
It can occur several months, or even years, after a pregnancy.
Although choriocarcinoma starts in the womb, it can spread to other parts of the body – most commonly, the lungs.
If it spreads to your lungs, you may have symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing and chest pain.
If choriocarcinoma spreads to your abdomen, you may have stomach pain, and if it spreads to your vagina, you may have heavy bleeding and a lump (nodule) may develop in your vagina.
If it spreads to your brain, it may cause headaches or seizures.
Chemotherapy is used to treat choriocarcinoma and usually successfully cures it."
Outlook,"Overall, the outlook for persistent trophoblastic disease and choriocarcinoma is excellent, and nearly all women who develop a gestational trophoblastic cancer are cured.
But your outlook will depend on your individual personal circumstances.
Cancer Research UK: outlook for persistent trophoblastic disease"
Further information,"In England, there are 2 specialist centres that screen for and treat gestational trophoblastic tumours:

Symptoms of a personality disorder,"Symptoms vary depending on the type of personality disorder.
For example, a person with borderline personality disorder (one of the most common types) tends to have disturbed ways of thinking, impulsive behaviour and problems controlling their emotions.
They may have intense but unstable relationships and worry about people abandoning them.
A person with antisocial personality disorder will typically get easily frustrated and have difficulty controlling their anger.
They may blame other people for problems in their life, and be aggressive and violent, upsetting others with their behaviour.
Someone with a personality disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression and drug addiction.
Other types of personality disorder will have different symptoms."
Treatment for a personality disorder,"Treatment for a personality disorder usually involves a talking therapy and can also include other types of therapy and medicine.
Talking therapies
This is where the person talks to a therapist to get a better understanding of their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours.
Treatment can last several months or years, depending on the severity of the condition and other problems the person may have.
As well as listening and discussing important issues with the person, the therapist may identify strategies to resolve problems and, if necessary, help them change their attitudes and behaviour.
Therapeutic communities
Treatment at a therapeutic community may be offered to some people with personality disorders. Therapeutic communities (TCs) are places where someone visits or stays for an intensive form of group therapy. The experience of having a personality disorder is explored in depth.
The person usually attends for a number of weeks or months.
Medicine
Medicine may be prescribed to treat problems associated with a personality disorder, such as depression, anxiety or psychotic symptoms.
For example, moderate to severe symptoms of depression might be treated with a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
Read more about the treatment for borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder."
Recovery,"Many people with a personality disorder recover over time. Psychological or medical treatment is often helpful, but support is sometimes all that's needed.
There's no single approach that suits everyone – treatment should be tailored to the individual."
Causes,"It's not clear exactly what causes personality disorders, but they're thought to result from a combination of the genes a person inherits and early environmental influences – for example, a distressing childhood experience (such as abuse or neglect)."
"Pregnancy, becoming a parent and personality disorders","If you have a personality disorder, you may need extra support during your pregnancy and after your child is born.
You can speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor if you would like support.
Find out more about mental health in pregnancy."
Support for people living with a personality disorder,"Having a personality disorder can have a big effect on the person's life, as well as their family and friends, but support is available.

Why PET scans are used,"A PET scan can show how well certain parts of your body are working, rather than simply showing what they look like.
PET scans are particularly helpful for investigating confirmed cases of cancer to determine how far the cancer has spread and how well it's responding to treatment.
PET scans are sometimes used to help plan operations, such as a coronary artery bypass graft or brain surgery for epilepsy.
They can also help diagnose some conditions that affect the normal workings of the brain, such as dementia."
How PET scans work,"PET scanners work by detecting the radiation given off by a substance injected into your arm called a radiotracer as it collects in different parts of your body.
In most PET scans a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used, which is similar to naturally occurring glucose (a type of sugar) so your body treats it in a similar way.
By analysing the areas where the radiotracer does and does not build up, it's possible to work out how certain body functions are working.
For example, using FDG in the body's tissues can help identify cancerous cells because they use glucose at a much faster rate than normal cells."
Preparing for a PET scan,"PET scans are usually carried out on an outpatient basis. This means you won't need to stay in hospital overnight.
It's important you arrive on time because the radiotracer used for your scan only works well for a short time. Your scan may have to be cancelled if you're late.
Your appointment letter will mention anything you need to do to prepare for your scan.
Usually, you’ll be advised not to eat anything for 6 hours beforehand, but you can drink water.
You should also avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours before your appointment.
It's a good idea to wear loose, comfortable clothes. It may be possible to wear these during the scan, although sometimes you may be asked to change into a hospital gown.
Avoid wearing jewellery and clothes that have metal parts, such as zips, because these will need to be removed.
If you're claustrophobic, ask the hospital staff before the day of the scan about the possibility of having a mild sedative to help you relax."
What happens during the scan,"Radiotracer injection
The radiotracer is injected into a vein in your arm or hand about an hour before your scan, as it takes time for it to reach the right cells in your body.
It's important to relax, keep as still as possible, and avoid talking while you wait because moving and speaking can affect where the radiotracer goes in your body.
You can go to the toilet if you need to before having the scan.
The scan
During the scan, you lie on a flat bed that's moved into a large, cylindrical scanner.
The flat bed is moved into the scanner before the scan begins
Credit:
Stay still and don't talk while the scanner takes pictures of your body.
The scan usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. Having the scan is completely painless, but you may feel uncomfortable lying still for this long.
The medical team can see and talk to you throughout the scan.
After the scan
You shouldn't experience any side effects after having a PET scan and can usually go home the same day.
The results of your scan won't usually be available on the same day. They'll be sent to your specialist to be discussed at your next appointment."
Possible risks of a PET scan,"Any exposure to radiation carries a very small risk of potential tissue damage that could cause cancer at a later date.
But the amount of radiation you're exposed to in a standard PET scan is safe.
The radiotracer becomes quickly less radioactive over time and will usually be passed out of your body naturally within a few hours. Drinking plenty of fluid after the scan can help flush it from your body.
As a precaution, you may be advised to avoid close contact with pregnant women, babies and young children for a few hours after having a PET scan. This is because you'll be slightly radioactive during this time.
The CT component of a PET-CT scan also involves exposure to a small amount of additional radiation, but the risk of this causing any problems in the future is still very small."
How the tumour affects the adrenal glands,"The adrenal glands make a number of important hormones, which are released into the bloodstream when needed. These hormones control heart rate, blood pressure and metabolism (the chemical processes that keep your organs working).
A phaeochromocytoma can cause the adrenal glands to produce too much of these hormones, which often results in problems such as heart palpitations and high blood pressure."
Symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma,"The symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma tend to be unpredictable, often occurring in sudden attacks lasting from a few minutes to an hour.
The attacks may last longer, and become more frequent and severe, as the tumour grows.
The symptoms and signs of a phaeochromocytoma can include:
headaches
heavy sweating
heart palpitations
high blood pressure
a pale face
feeling or being sick
feeling anxious or panicky
shakiness (tremor)
Some people with a phaeochromocytoma do not have symptoms, and their condition is either never diagnosed or only discovered during tests for another problem, such as high blood pressure. Others have symptoms for many years before a phaeochromocytoma is diagnosed."
Causes of a phaeochromocytoma,"Many phaeochromocytomas occur for no obvious reason and do not run in the family.
However, up to 1 in every 3 occurs as part of an inherited genetic disorder, such as:
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
These genetic disorders cause different tumours or growths to develop around the body.
If you're diagnosed with a phaeochromocytoma, your doctor may recommend having genetic testing to see if you have any of these disorders."
Diagnosing a phaeochromocytoma,"Diagnosing a phaeochromocytoma can be difficult because the symptoms are quite general and could be caused by many other more common conditions.
An adrenal gland tumour is sometimes discovered during a scan for another reason. Further tests to find out more about the tumour may include:
blood and urine tests
a CT scan
an MRI scan
Cancer Research UK has more information about the tests and scans that are used to help diagnose a phaeochromocytoma."
Treating a phaeochromocytoma,"Most people with a phaeochromocytoma will need surgery to have it removed.
You'll usually be given medicine called alpha blockers (and in some cases beta blockers) for several weeks before the operation. They block the effects of the excess hormones on your body and stabilise your heart rate and blood pressure.
The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic (when you're unconscious). It may be done as:
""keyhole"" (laparoscopic) surgery – a number of small cuts (incisions) are made and fine instruments are passed through these to remove the tumour; this is the most common type of surgery for phaeochromocytomas
open surgery – a single larger incision is made in the skin to access and remove the tumour
The incisions will usually be made in your tummy (abdomen).
Your doctor will discuss the best type of operation for you and explain the procedure in detail, including the risks. They'll also answer any questions you have.
If your phaeochromocytoma is cancerous, you may need chemotherapy or radiotherapy in addition to surgery.
If your tumour cannot be removed, you'll need medicine to manage your condition. This will usually be a combination of medicines to control the effects of the excessive hormones."
Outlook,"Without treatment, phaeochromocytomas can cause severe problems and significantly affect your quality of life.
You'll be at risk of an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), heart attacks, strokes and organ failure.
However, most tumours can be successfully removed by surgery and this will usually mean most of the symptoms disappear.
In a small number of people, the tumour may come back. You'll therefore need regular check-ups following surgery so that, if it does return, it can be picked up and treated as soon as possible. Contact your GP immediately if your symptoms come back.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about phaeochromocytomas."
Diagnosing PKU,"At around 5 days old, babies are offered newborn blood spot screening to test for PKU and many other conditions. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.
If PKU is confirmed, treatment will be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment includes a special diet and regular blood tests.
With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, most children with PKU are able to live healthy lives.
About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU."
Symptoms of PKU,"PKU does not usually cause any symptoms if treatment is started early.
Without treatment, PKU can damage the brain and nervous system, which can lead to learning disabilities.
Other symptoms of untreated PKU include:
behavioural difficulties such as frequent temper tantrums and episodes of self-harm
fairer skin, hair and eyes than siblings who do not have the condition (phenylalanine is involved in the body's production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair colour)
eczema 
repeatably being sick
jerking movements in arms and legs
tremors
epilepsy
musty smell to the breath, skin and urine"
Treating PKU,"Diet
The main treatment for PKU is a low-protein diet and controlled intake of many other foods, such as potatoes and cereals.
High protein foods should be completely avoided. These include:
meat and fish
eggs and cheese
nuts and seeds
flour-based foods, like bread, pasta, cakes and biscuits
soya, quorn and tofu
In addition, people with PKU must take an amino acid supplement to ensure they're getting all the nutrients required for normal growth and good health.
There are also several low-protein versions of common foods (such as flour, rice and pasta) specifically designed for people with PKU and related conditions to incorporate into their diets. Many of these are available on prescription.
If a high phenylalanine level is confirmed, a baby will immediately be started on a low-protein diet and amino acid supplements.
Phenylalanine levels are regularly monitored by collecting blood from a finger prick on to a special card and sending it to a laboratory.
A dietitian will create a detailed dietary plan for your child that can be revised as your child grows and their needs change.
As long as a person with PKU sticks to a low-protein diet throughout childhood, and their phenylalanine levels stay within certain limits, they'll remain well and their brain function should be unaffected.
Aspartame
People with PKU must also avoid food products that contain aspartame, as it's converted into phenylalanine in the body.
Aspartame is a sweetener found in:
sugar substitutes such as the artificial sweeteners often used in tea and coffee
diet versions of fizzy drinks
chewing gum
squash and cordial
some alcopops
All food products that contain aspartame or a related product should be clearly labelled.
There are also medicines that contain aspartame, such as some children's cold and flu remedies.
It's a legal requirement for any medicine that contains aspartame to state it on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine.
Sapropterin
Sapropterin is a medicine that may be used with a low-protein diet to treat a mild form of PKU called hyperphenylalaninaemia.
If you have hyperphenylalaninaemia, sapropterin may be recommended if you are:
under 22 years of age
pregnant
an adult likely to respond to treatment (you’ll have a genetic test to find out)
It’s thought that sapropterin may help:
reduce the level of phenylalanine in the body
improve the symptoms of PKU and help protect the brain
allow you to eat a less restricted diet
get more control of phenylalanine levels than through diet alone
But it’s uncertain how well sapropterin works in the long term.
If sapropterin is recommended for you, you’ll have regular blood tests to check how well it's working.
Regular blood tests
A child with phenylketonuria will need regular blood tests to measure levels of phenylalanine in their blood and assess how well they're responding to treatment.
Only a drop of blood is needed, and it can be collected at home and sent to the hospital by post.
You may be able to have training so you can do your child's blood tests, or be able to test yourself if you have PKU. This will make testing more convenient.
It's recommended that children who are:
1 year or younger should have their blood tested once a week
between 1 and 12 years should have their blood tested every 2 weeks
over 12 years should have their blood tested once a month
Someone with PKU will usually need to have regular blood tests throughout their life."
How PKU is inherited,"The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for PKU is passed on by the parents, who are usually carriers and do not have any symptoms of the condition themselves.
The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father.
If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of PKU.
If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:
a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting the condition
a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of PKU
a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes"
Adults with PKU,"Many adults with PKU find they function best while on a low-protein diet. The current advice is for people with PKU to remain on a low-protein diet for life.
Unlike in young children, there is not yet any evidence that high phenylalanine levels cause any permanent brain damage in adults with PKU.
Some adults with PKU may have higher phenylalanine levels because they find it difficult to follow the low-protein diet or have returned to a normal diet.
As a result, they may find they do not function as well. For example, they may lose concentration or have a slower reaction time.
These adverse effects can usually be reversed by going back on to a strict diet to bring the phenylalanine levels down again.
Anyone who returned to a normal diet should still be supported by their clinicians and have a regular follow-up to monitor their condition for any complications that might arise.
For women with PKU, it's essential that they return to a strict diet if they're considering becoming pregnant, as high phenylalanine levels can harm an unborn child."
PKU and pregnancy,"Women with PKU must take particular care during pregnancy, as high levels of phenylalanine can damage their unborn baby.
Provided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled during pregnancy, problems can be avoided and there's no reason why a woman with PKU should not be able to have a normal, healthy baby.
It's recommended that all women with PKU plan their pregnancies carefully. You should aim to follow a strict low-protein diet and monitor your blood before becoming pregnant.
It's best to try to conceive once phenylalanine levels are within the target range for pregnancy.
During pregnancy, you'll be asked to provide blood samples 2 times a week and will be in frequent contact with a dietitian. The medicine, sapropterin, may also be recommended for you during your pregnancy.
As soon as your baby is born, phenylalanine control can be relaxed and there's no reason why you cannot breastfeed your baby.
Contact your PKU doctor and dietitian as soon as possible if you become pregnant when your phenylalanine levels are not adequately controlled.
If your phenylalanine levels can be brought under control within the first few weeks of your pregnancy, the risk of damage to your baby should be small. But your pregnancy will need to be monitored very carefully.
Information about you
If you or your child has PKU, your clinical team will pass on information about you to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS register"
Check if you have phlebitis,"Phlebitis usually affects the veins in the legs, but you can also get it in your arms or neck.
The main symptoms are:
pain, tenderness or swelling in the affected area
warm and itchy skin over the affected area
changes to the colour and texture of the surrounding skin – for example, the skin may be red and it may be thick and hard
Phlebitis is common in people with varicose veins.
Credit:
Phlebitis can be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:"
Treatments for phlebitis,"Treatment for phlebitis may not be needed if your symptoms are mild.
But treatment may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or do not go away.
Treatments may include:
anti-inflammatory medicines – cream or gel can be used if the affected area is small
compression stockings – these increase blood flow to the legs but are only suitable for some people with phlebitis
blood-thinning medicine to reduce the risk of blood clots and help stop phlebitis coming back"
Things you can do to ease the symptoms of phlebitis,"There are things you can do to help ease the pain and discomfort of phlebitis.
Do
continue using the affected leg or arm
raise your leg or arm while resting
put a warm, moist flannel over the affected area
take paracetamol or ibuprofen – if you’ve been prescribed blood-thinning medicine, do not take ibuprofen unless advised to by your doctor"
Causes of phlebitis,"It's not always clear what causes phlebitis.
Often the inflammation is linked to:
varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins, usually in the legs)
conditions that cause the blood to clot more easily like thrombophilia
autoimmune conditions like Behçet's disease (a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels)
having injections or a small plastic tube (cannula) inserted into a vein
Other things that can increase your chances of getting phlebitis include:
getting older
being obese
being pregnant
having cancer
having phlebitis in the past"
Uses for photodynamic therapy (PDT),"PDT can be used to treat abnormal cells in parts of the body that a light source can reach, such as the skin, eyes, mouth, food pipe (oesophagus) and lungs.
Conditions sometimes treated with PDT include:
actinic keratoses – dry, scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure that could become cancerous if not treated
Bowen's disease – a very early form of skin cancer
basal cell carcinoma – a type of non-melanoma skin cancer
Barrett's oesophagus – changes in the cells in the lining of your lower food pipe (oesophagus) that could become cancerous if not treated
oesophageal cancer and lung cancer – PDT can cure some cancers if used in the early stages, or offer relief from symptoms in more advanced cases
PDT also shows promise in treating some other types of cancer, as well as warts, acne and extramammary Paget's disease (a pre-cancerous condition that affects skin around the genitals and anus)."
What happens during photodynamic therapy (PDT),"There are 2 ways of having PDT:
PDT using light from a lamp or laser (sometimes called conventional PDT)
PDT using natural daylight (sometimes called daylight PDT)
Conventional PDT
Conventional PDT is done in 2 stages.
1) Preparation
First, you'll need to go into a hospital or clinic to be given the light-sensitive medicine.
Depending on the area of your body that's being treated, the medicine may be a cream, injection or special drink.
After you've had the medicine you may be asked to go home and return in a few hours or days – this will give the medicine a chance to build-up in the abnormal cells.
2) Light treatment
Later, you'll need to return to the hospital or clinic for the light treatment.
This will involve a lamp or laser being shone on to the treatment area for around 10 to 45 minutes.
To treat abnormal cells inside your body, such as in your lungs, an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a light at the end) will be passed into your body.
Sometimes a local anaesthetic may be used to numb the treatment area or you may be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure. Sometimes a general anaesthetic is used to put you to sleep while you have the procedure.
Daylight PDT
Daylight PDT is used for some skin conditions. The medicine is a cream which is put on the affected area at a hospital or clinic, or sometimes at home. You'll then need to spend 2 hours outdoors in daylight to activate the medicine. You'll need to put on sunscreen while doing daylight PDT."
After photodynamic therapy (PDT),"Conventional PDT
If your skin was treated, the area will be covered by a dressing that should remain in place for about a day. Your care team will tell you exactly how long.
Try to avoid scratching or knocking the treated area, and keep it as dry as possible.
Once you're advised to remove the dressing, you can wash and bathe as normal, as long as you gently pat the treated area dry.
A follow-up appointment at the hospital or clinic will be arranged to assess whether the treatment has been effective and decide if it needs to be repeated.
It usually takes around 2 to 6 weeks for the area to heal completely, depending on which part of the body has been treated and how big the area is.
Daylight PDT
After daylight PDT, the medicine is wiped off and the area of skin that's been treated is covered for the rest of the day, to prevent swelling (inflammation).
If it's not possible to cover the area, you'll need to stay indoors or use a sunscreen (at least SPF 50) for the rest of the day after the treatment.
You'll have a follow-up appointment to see how well the treatment has worked and whether you need a 2nd treatment."
Risks and side effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT),"PDT is a very safe and effective treatment when it's used for conditions it's been officially approved (licensed) to treat. But the following side effects are common:
a burning or stinging sensation while the light treatment is done – this usually passes soon after the treatment finishes
if the medicine was injected or drunk as a liquid, your skin or eyes may be sensitive to sunlight and bright indoor lights for up to 6 weeks; speak to your care team about things you should do to protect your eyes and skin during this time
Other potential side effects depend on the area treated.
If your skin is treated, it may become red, swollen, blistered or itchy for a few days and have a scabby crust for a few weeks. Occasionally, it may become slightly darker or lighter and there may be some hair loss. This is usually temporary, but can sometimes be permanent.
Treatment of the oesophagus and lungs can cause a sore throat, chest pain, feeling sick and a small amount of blood in your phlegm. This is usually temporary. Speak to your care team if you cough up blood.
Talk to your doctors about the possible risks of PDT before having the treatment."
When is physiotherapy used?,"Physiotherapy can be helpful for people of all ages with a wide range of health conditions, including problems affecting the:
bones, joints and soft tissue – such as back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and sports injuries
brain or nervous system – such as movement problems resulting from a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease
heart and circulation – such as rehabilitation after a heart attack
lungs and breathing – such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis
Physiotherapy can improve your physical activity while helping you to prevent further injuries."
Physiotherapists,"Physiotherapy is provided by specially trained and regulated practitioners called physiotherapists.
Physiotherapists often work as part of a multidisciplinary team in various areas of medicine and settings, including:
hospitals
community health centres or clinics
some GP surgeries
some sports teams, clubs, charities and workplaces
Some physiotherapists can also offer home visits."
What physiotherapists do,"Physiotherapists consider the body as a whole, rather than just focusing on the individual aspects of an injury or illness.
Some of the main approaches used by physiotherapists include:
education and advice – physiotherapists can give general advice about things that can affect your daily lives, such as posture and correct lifting or carrying techniques to help prevent injuries
movement, tailored exercise and physical activity advice – exercises may be recommended to improve your general health and mobility, and to strengthen specific parts of your body
manual therapy – where the physiotherapist uses their hands to help relieve pain and stiffness, and to encourage better movement of the body
There are other techniques that may sometimes be used, such as exercises carried out in water (hydrotherapy or aquatic therapy) or acupuncture.
Read more about the main physiotherapy techniques."
Finding a physiotherapist,"Physiotherapy is available through the NHS or privately.
You may need a referral from your GP to have physiotherapy on the NHS, although in some areas it's possible to refer yourself directly.
To find out whether self-referral is available in your area, ask the reception staff at your GP surgery or contact your local hospital trust.
Waiting lists for NHS treatment can be long and some people choose to pay for private treatment. Most private physiotherapists accept direct self-referrals.

Check if you have an infected pilonidal sinus,"Most people with a pilonidal sinus do not notice it unless it becomes infected and causes symptoms.
An infection will cause pain and swelling at the top of the cleft in your buttocks, and a pus-filled skin abscess can develop.
Sometimes a pus-filled abscess can develop suddenly, causing pain and swelling, and making it difficult to sit down.
If you keep getting infections you may have ongoing problems, like discomfort or pain, and regularly seeping pus or blood."
A pilonidal sinus that's not infected,"Treatment is not needed for a pilonidal sinus if there are no signs of infection. A ""watch and wait"" approach will be recommended.
It's very important to keep the area between your buttocks clean by showering or bathing regularly.
Do not shave the affected area unless a GP advises you to."
Treatments for an infected pilonidal sinus,"Treatment for an infected pilonidal sinus will depend on:
your symptoms
the size of the pilonidal sinus
whether it's your first infected pilonidal sinus or it keeps coming back
If you have a painful, swollen abscess, it usually needs to be cut and the pus drained. You may also need antibiotics.
There are a number of treatment options for a pilonidal sinus that keeps coming back and that's painful, bleeding or leaking discharge. Your doctor will discuss these with you.
In most cases you'll be offered painkillers, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to help reduce pain and swelling."
What to do after your operation,"Do
keep the affected area clean
wear comfortable, loose-fitting cotton underwear
eat plenty of fibre to make going to the toilet easier and avoid straining
Don’t
do not lift heavy objects or do strenuous exercise for the first week or so
do not ride a bike for 6 to 8 weeks
do not go swimming until your wound has completely healed
Going back to work
How soon you can return to work depends on:
the procedure you had
how quickly you recover
the type of job you do
Most people are able to return to work within 2 weeks of surgery.
Your surgeon will be able to give you more advice about your recovery."
Causes of pilonidal sinus,"It's not clear what causes a pilonidal sinus.
A skin problem, pressure or friction may cause hair between the buttocks to be pushed inwards.
This may either be hair growing around the buttock area, or loose hair shed from the buttocks or elsewhere that gathers around the buttock cleft and enters the pilonidal sinus.
Pilonidal sinuses are more common in men because they tend to be hairier.
Sitting for long periods can also increase your chances of getting a pilonidal sinus."
What is pins and needles?,"Pins and needles feels like a pricking, tingling or numbness sensation.
It happens when the blood supply to the nerves is cut off. This is usually when you sit or sleep on part of your body. It only lasts a few minutes.
You often get pins and needles in your:
arms
hands
legs
feet
It usually stops when the weight is taken off the body part and your blood supply returns to the nerves."
Possible causes of pins and needles,"There are some possible medical causes of pins and needles. If you have other symptoms this might help to find the cause.
But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Possible causes of symptoms
Symptoms Possible conditions
Pins and needles, pain or numbness in hands and feet
Diabetes
Pins and needles in fingers or toes that change colour
Raynaud's
Breathing too quickly, trembling hands, pins and needles
Hyperventilation
Pain and pins and needles that travels from your back, down your leg to your foot
Sciatica
Pins and needles in different parts of your body
Multiple sclerosis
Long-lasting pins and needles may also be caused by:
treatments – such as chemotherapy
some medicines – such as HIV medicine, medicine to prevent seizures, or some antibiotics
toxic substances – such as lead or radiation
poor diet
a trapped nerve in your back or neck
nerve damage – after an injury or illness
drinking too much alcohol"
What are PIP implants?,"PIP implants are silicone breast implants containing unapproved silicone gel.
They were manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP). The concerns relate to all breast implants manufactured by PIP. 
It's estimated around 47,000 British women had PIP implants fitted, most of whom are still living with them.
The vast majority of PIP implants were fitted in private clinics, but a small number were done on the NHS, mostly for breast reconstruction after breast cancer."
Risks of PIP implants,"PIP implants are 2 to 6 times more likely to rupture than standard silicone implants.
This doesn't pose a serious risk to your health, but it can cause some unpleasant symptoms.
See your GP if you have signs of a rupture, such as:
lumpiness or swelling in and around the breast
a change in the shape of the breast
redness – this may be harder to see on black or brown skin
pain and tenderness
a burning sensation
enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit
Ruptured PIP implants have no proven long-term health effects. British and European researchers have so far not found any evidence to suggest that the ingredients in the implants can cause cancer or are toxic.
Find further information at:
GOV.UK: Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants: final report
European Commission: Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR): preliminary opinion on the safety of Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) silicone breast implants "
How to find out if you have PIP implants,"You may have been given details about your breast implants when they were fitted. This will often include information about the manufacturer of your implants.
If you don't have these details, you can ask for them from the clinic or hospital where the implants were fitted. The medical notes kept by your GP may also include this information.
Most women who had PIP implants fitted on the NHS should already have received a letter telling them about it and advising them what to do."
What to do if you have PIP implants,"You should get medical advice if you have PIP implants.
If the implants were fitted on the NHS, your GP can arrange for you to see an NHS specialist.
If they were fitted privately, contact the clinic.
If they were fitted privately and the clinic is unable or unwilling to help, speak to your GP about seeing an NHS specialist.
You should have an ultrasound scan or MRI scan to check whether your implants have ruptured. A ruptured implant should be removed as soon as possible.
If there are no signs of a rupture, talk to your surgeon about the benefits and risks of taking the implants out or leaving them in.
If you're concerned about leaving them in, removing them will usually be recommended.
If you decide to keep them in, you should look out for signs of a rupture and have a yearly check-up with your doctor to make sure the implants are still intact."
Removing and replacing PIP implants,"Some private clinics have agreed to remove and replace PIP breast implants free of charge, while others charge a fee.
If the clinic where you had your implants fitted won't help you because it has closed or is unwilling to do so, you may be able to have your implants removed free of charge on the NHS.
However, the NHS in England won't provide replacement implants if your original implants were fitted privately, except in a very small number of cases where they were fitted for medical, rather than cosmetic, reasons.
If you had PIP breast implants originally fitted on the NHS, you may be able to have them removed and replaced by the NHS at no cost.
The operation to remove and replace PIP implants is done wherever possible through the original surgical cuts."
Check if you have pityriasis rosea,"The main symptom of pityriasis rosea is a rash.
Some people get flu-like symptoms a few days before the rash appears, including:
tiredness
a sore throat
a high temperature
a headache
The rash appears in 2 stages.
Stage 1: single, round patch
The first stage of the rash is a single, scaly patch called a herald patch.
The herald patch is usually oval or round, slightly raised and about 2cm to 5cm across. It usually appears on the chest, thigh, upper arm or neck, but you can get it anywhere on the body.
On white skin, the herald patch is usually pink with a red border. On brown or black skin, the herald patch may be darker with a light border.
Credit:
Stage 2: widespread rash
A widespread rash of small, scaly spots appears about 5 to 15 days after you get the herald patch.
Usually you get the rash on your chest and back, but it can appear on the arms or legs. In children, it may appear on the face or scalp.
It usually appears in the same place on both sides of the body and may be itchy.
On white skin, the spots are pink or red.
Credit:
On black or brown skin, the spots can be grey, dark brown or black.
Credit:
After the rash has gone, you may have some darker or lighter areas of skin. This may be more obvious on brown or black skin. In most people, these should go back to normal within a few months and will not leave permanent scarring."
Treatment for pityriasis rosea,"Pityriasis rosea usually gets better on its own within a few months without any treatment. It might get worse before it goes away completely.
If the rash is uncomfortable or itchy, a pharmacist might advise:
using an emollient (moisturising treatment for the skin) on the rash
taking antihistamine tablets to help with the itching
avoiding using soaps and body washes
A pharmacist will tell you how often to take or apply any treatments.
If these treatments do not work or if you have severe pityriasis rosea, your GP may recommend steroid cream or refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist)."
How you get pityriasis rosea,"The exact cause of pityriasis rosea is not known. It may be caused by a virus.
Pityriasis rosea cannot spread from person to person."
Check if you have pityriasis versicolor,"Pityriasis versicolor causes patches of skin to change colour.
On white skin, the patches are usually pink, red or pale brown. You may notice the patches do not tan in the sun.
On brown or black skin, the patches tend to be paler than the surrounding skin.
The patches usually appear on the chest, upper back, upper arms, neck or tummy.
The patches are flat and round and can join up to form large areas. They may look scaly and can sometimes be itchy."
Treatment from a GP,"A GP can prescribe treatment for pityriasis versicolor.
The main treatments are:
antifungal shampoo (such as ketoconazole) that you use on the affected skin and rinse off after a few minutes
antifungal cream
If pityriasis versicolor covers a large area, or shampoos and creams do not work, a GP may prescribe antifungal tablets.
It can take a few months for the skin to return to its usual colour after treatment and the patches can come back.
If they come back, you may need the same treatment again or your GP may suggest long-term treatment such as using antifungal shampoo every few weeks."
How you get pityriasis versicolor,"Pityriasis versicolor is caused by a type of fungus that lives on the skin.
Most people have this fungus on their skin without it causing any problems. But sometimes it can grow and spread more than usual, causing pityriasis versicolor.
It’s not always clear why this happens. It’s not caused by not washing your skin and most people who have it are otherwise healthy.
Pityriasis versicolor cannot spread from person to person."
Check if you have plantar fasciitis,"The main symptom of plantar fasciitis is pain on the bottom of your foot, around your heel and arch.
Credit:
It's more likely to be plantar fasciitis if:
the pain is much worse when you start walking after sleeping or resting
the pain feels better during exercise, but returns after resting
it's difficult to raise your toes off the floor"
How to ease plantar fasciitis yourself,"If you see a GP, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest and raise your foot on a stool when you can
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
wear shoes with cushioned heels and good arch support
use insoles or heel pads in your shoes
try regular gentle stretching exercises
try exercises that do not put pressure on your feet, such as swimming
take painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen
try to lose weight if you’re overweight
Don’t
do not take ibuprofen for the first 48 hours
do not walk or stand for long periods
do not wear high heels or tight pointy shoes
do not wear flip-flops or backless slippers
try not to walk barefoot on hard surfaces
A pharmacist can help with plantar fasciitis
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
insoles and pads for your shoes
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for plantar fasciitis from a foot specialist,"If plantar fasciitis does not get better, a GP might refer you to a physiotherapist or foot specialist (podiatrist).
A physiotherapist can show you exercises to help ease your symptoms. A podiatrist can recommend things like insoles and the right shoes to wear.
Physiotherapy is available free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK but waiting times for accessing physiotherapy can sometimes be long.
Podiatry may not be available for free on the NHS everywhere and waiting times can sometimes be long.
You can also pay to see a podiatrist or physiotherapist privately.
Find a registered podiatrist
Find a registered physiotherapist
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have plantar fasciitis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for plantar fasciitis near you"
Common causes of plantar fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis is caused by straining the part of your foot that connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia).
It's not always clear why this happens.
You may be more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:
are 40 to 60 years of age
recently started exercising on hard surfaces
exercise with a tight calf or heel
overstretch the sole of your foot during exercise
recently started doing a lot more walking, running or standing up
wear shoes with poor cushioning or support
are very overweight"
When plastic surgery is used,"Plastic surgery can be used to repair:
abnormalities that have existed from birth, such as a cleft lip and palate, webbed fingers, and birthmarks
areas damaged by the removal of cancerous tissue, such as from the face or breast
extensive burns or other serious injuries
Plastic surgery can often help improve a person's self-esteem, confidence and overall quality of life."
Availability of plastic surgery,"Reconstructive plastic surgery is usually carried out free of charge by the NHS. But availability varies around the country and is determined by local integrated care boards (ICBs).
Plastic surgeons have extensive training and belong to professional associations, such as the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS).
Check whether a particular surgeon belongs to BAPRAS
Most people are referred to NHS plastic surgeons by their GP or a specialist consultant they see about their condition.
Plastic surgery is also available privately, but it can be very expensive.
It's still a good idea to speak to your GP or specialist first if you're considering private treatment, even if a referral isn't required."
Plastic surgery techniques,"Some of the techniques used during plastic surgery are:
skin grafts – where healthy skin from an unaffected area of the body is removed and used to replace lost or damaged skin
skin flap surgery – where a piece of tissue from one part of the body is transferred to another, along with the blood vessels that keep it alive; it's called flap surgery because the healthy tissue usually remains partially attached to the body while it's repositioned
tissue expansion – where surrounding tissue is stretched to enable the body to ""grow"" extra skin, which can then be used to help reconstruct the nearby area
As well as these techniques, plastic surgeons also use many other methods, such as:
fat transfer or grafting – where fat is removed from one area and inserted in another area, usually to correct unevenness
vacuum closure – where suction is applied to a wound through a sterile piece of foam or gauze to draw out fluid and encourage healing
camouflage make-up or cream
prosthetic devices, such as artificial limbs
Read more about how plastic surgery is performed."
Risks of plastic surgery,"As with any type of surgery, plastic surgery has associated risks.
The degree of risk depends on the size of the affected area, the surgeon's level of experience, and the overall health of the person having the procedure.
Some procedures carry specific risks, but general risks include:
pain and discomfort
bleeding
infection
scarring
Contact your surgeon, healthcare team or GP immediately if you have any concerns after surgery, such as unexpected pain, swelling, discharge, or other side effects."
Check if it's pleurisy,"The main symptom of pleurisy is sharp chest pain when you breathe in.
The pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around.
It may also spread to your shoulders and back."
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of pleurisy, a GP will examine you and listen to your chest.
The GP may refer you to a specialist if they're not sure what's causing your symptoms.
You may need to have tests, such as:
blood tests
a chest X-ray
an ultrasound scan
a CT scan"
Treatment for pleurisy,"Pleurisy will usually get better on its own in a few days without treatment from a GP.
If your symptoms are being caused by a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, you may need antibiotics.
You can ease the chest pain by:
taking painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
resting in different positions until you find a comfortable one – lying on the painful side can help
You may need to have treatment in hospital if your symptoms are severe or being caused by something more serious, such as a pulmonary embolism or tuberculosis."
Symptoms of PMS,"Each woman's symptoms are different and can vary from month to month.
The most common symptoms of PMS include:
mood swings
feeling upset, anxious or irritable
tiredness or trouble sleeping
bloating or tummy pain
breast tenderness
headaches
spotty skin
greasy hair
changes in appetite and sex drive"
Things you can do to help,"Do
exercise regularly
eat a healthy, balanced diet – you may find that eating frequent smaller meals (every 2-3 hours) suits you better than eating 3 larger meals a day
get plenty of sleep – 7 to 8 hours is recommended
try reducing your stress by doing yoga or meditation
take painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to ease the pain
keep a diary of your symptoms for at least 2 to 3 menstrual cycles – you can take this to a GP appointment
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol"
Treating PMS,"As well as changes to your lifestyle, a GP can recommend treatments including:
hormonal medicine – such as the combined contraceptive pill
cognitive behavioural therapy – a talking therapy
antidepressants
dietary supplements
If you still get symptoms after trying these treatments, you may be referred to a specialist.
This could be a gynaecologist, psychiatrist or counsellor.
Complementary therapies and dietary supplements
Complementary therapies and dietary supplements may help with PMS, but the evidence of their effectiveness is limited.
They can include:
acupuncture
reflexology
supplements such as vitamin B6, calcium and vitamin D and magnesium (check with a GP or pharmacist if you are also taking medicines before starting to take regular supplements)"
Causes of PMS,"It's not fully understood why women get PMS.
But it may be because of changes in their hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.
Some women may be more affected by these changes than others."
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD),"A small number of women may experience more severe symptoms of PMS known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
Symptoms of PMDD are similar to PMS but are much more intense and can have a much greater negative impact on your daily activities and quality of life.
Symptoms can include:
physical symptoms such as cramps, headaches and joint and muscle pain
behavioural symptoms such as binge eating and problems sleeping
mental and emotional symptoms, such as feeling very anxious, angry, depressed or, in some cases, even suicidal
If you need urgent advice you can:
call a GP and ask for an emergency appointment
call 111 out of hours (they will help you find the support and help you need)
call a helpline, such as the Samaritans (call free on 116 123)
If you feel that you may be about to harm yourself, call 999 for an ambulance or go straight to A&E. Or you can ask someone else to call 999 or take you to A&E.
Read more about getting urgent help for mental health problems.
The exact causes of PMDD are unknown but it has been linked to sensitivity to changes in hormones or certain genetic variations (differences in genes) you can inherit from your parents.
The Mind website has information about PMDD."
Check if you have pneumonia,"Symptoms of pneumonia can start suddenly or gradually over a few days.
They include:
a cough – you may cough up yellow or green mucus (phlegm)
shortness of breath
a high temperature
chest pain
an aching body
feeling very tired
loss of appetite
making wheezing noises when you breathe – babies may also make grunting noises
feeling confused – this is common in older people"
Treatment for pneumonia,"You'll usually be given antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks.
Some people are more at risk of becoming seriously ill. You may need to go to hospital for treatment if:
you're over 65
you have cardiovascular disease or a long-term lung condition
your baby or young child has pneumonia
you're very unwell
In hospital you'll usually be given fluids and antibiotics to treat the infection. You may also be given oxygen to help you breathe.
You may be sent for an X-ray of your chest and blood tests to check for other conditions.
Important
If you're given antibiotics to take at home, contact your doctor if you do not feel better after taking them for 2 to 3 days."
Things you can do if you have pneumonia,"There are some things you can do to help with recovery from pneumonia and reduce the risk of spreading it to other people.
Do
rest until you feel better – try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do normal activities
drink plenty of fluids
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain or a high temperature
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
put used tissues in the bin as quickly as possible
wash your hands regularly with water and soap
Don’t
do not take cough medicine – coughing helps your body get rid of the infection
do not smoke"
Causes of pneumonia,"Pneumonia is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection.
You can catch it from someone who has it, or you can sometimes get it if you have another infection such as flu or coronavirus (COVID-19).
It can be caused by a fungal infection but this is rare in healthy people in the UK.
It may also be caused by something getting into your lungs, such as water or food (aspiration pneumonia)."
Pneumonia vaccination,"If you're at risk of getting seriously ill with pneumonia, it's recommended you get the pneumococcal vaccine, also known as the pneumonia vaccine. It protects against an infection that can cause pneumonia.
People at high risk include:
babies
adults aged over 65
people with heart, lung, liver, kidney or neurological conditions with a risk of aspiration
people with diabetes
people with a weakened immune system, for example, you have a condition that stops your immune system working properly, or you are having treatment to suppress your immune system
Adults and children more at risk should also get a flu vaccine every year.
You can ask a GP or pharmacist about both vaccines.
Information:
Stopping smoking also reduces your chance of getting pneumonia."
Signs and symptoms of poisoning,"The symptoms of poisoning will depend on the type of poison and the amount taken in, but general things to look out for include:
being sick
stomach pains
confusion
drowsiness and fainting fits
If a child suddenly develops these symptoms, they may have been poisoned, particularly if they're drowsy and confused."
What to do,"If you suspect that someone has taken an overdose or has been poisoned, do not try to treat them yourself. Get medical help immediately.
If they do not appear to be seriously ill, call NHS 111 for advice.
If they're showing signs of being seriously ill, such as being sick, loss of consciousness, drowsiness or seizures (fits), call 999 to request an ambulance or take the person to your local A&E department.
In serious cases, it may be necessary for the person to stay in hospital for treatment. Most people admitted to hospital because of poisoning will survive.
Read more about what to do if you think someone has been poisoned."
Types of poisons,"Poisons can be swallowed, absorbed through the skin, injected, inhaled or splashed into the eyes.
An overdose of medicine is the most common form of poisoning in the UK. This can include both over-the-counter medicines, such as paracetamol, and prescription medicines, such as antidepressants.
Other potential poisons include:
household products, such as bleach
cosmetic items, such as nail polish
some types of plants and fungi
certain types of household chemicals and pesticides
carbon monoxide
poorly prepared or cooked food, and food that's gone mouldy or been contaminated with bacteria from raw meat (food poisoning)
alcohol, if an excessive amount is consumed over a short period of time (alcohol poisoning)
recreational drugs or substances
medicines prescribed for pets
Snakes and insects, such as wasps and bees, are not poisonous, but their bites or stings can contain venom (toxin)."
Preventing poisoning,"There are several things you can do to reduce your or your child's risk of poisoning.
These include carefully reading the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine and making sure that any poisonous substances are locked away out of the sight and reach of your children.
Read more about preventing poisoning."
Polio in the UK,"There have been no confirmed cases of paralysis due to polio caught in the UK since 1984.
Although some poliovirus has been found in sewage from London recently, the risk of getting it remains extremely low.
The chance of getting ill from polio is higher if you are not fully vaccinated, so it's important to make sure you, and your child, are up to date with your vaccines.
Washing your hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day also helps you avoid catching and spreading viruses."
Polio vaccination,"The best way to prevent polio is to make sure you and your child are up to date with your vaccinations.
The polio vaccine is part of the NHS routine childhood vaccination schedule.
The polio vaccine is given to children at:
8, 12 and 16 weeks old as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine
3 years, 4 months old as part of the 4-in-1 (DTaP/IPV) pre-school booster
14 years old as part of the 3-in-1 (Td/IPV) teenage booster
You need all 5 of these vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against polio.
You can contact your GP surgery to check if you, or your child, are up to date with your polio vaccinations. For children and babies, you can also check their personal child health record (red book).
If you are not up to date, book an appointment with your GP surgery to get vaccinated free on the NHS.
Information:
You can have a polio vaccination at any point if you've never had one before, even if you're not travelling to a country with a risk of getting polio.
You should also get vaccinated even if you've had polio before as it protects against different types of polio."
How polio is spread,"Polio is caused by a virus that spreads easily from person to person.
It usually spreads through contact with the poo of an infected person. For example, from not washing your hands properly and putting them in your mouth, or from contaminated food or water.
It can also spread through coughs or sneezes, but this is less common.
Your chance of getting polio in the UK is extremely low. This is because most people are fully vaccinated. Polio was eradicated in Europe in 2003.
There's still an extremely small risk of catching it when travelling in a country where polio is still found, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.
If you're not vaccinated, there is also a very small risk of getting it through contact with a person bringing the polio virus from these countries when they return to the UK."
Symptoms of polio,"Most people who get polio do not have symptoms.
Some people get mild, flu-like symptoms, such as:
a high temperature
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
headaches
being sick (vomiting)
a stiff neck
muscle pain
These symptoms usually last up to 10 days.
Rarely, polio can lead to more serious symptoms that affect the brain and nerves, such as weakness in your muscles (paralysis), usually in the legs. This can happen over hours or days.
If the paralysis affects the muscles used for breathing, it can be life threatening.
Most people will recover, and movement will slowly come back over the next few weeks. Some people can be left with permanent disability."
Treatments for polio,"There is no treatment for polio, but some types of care will help lower the risk of long-term problems.
This can include:
bed rest in hospital
painkillers
help with breathing
regular stretches and exercises to prevent problems with your muscles and joints
You may need to have specialist help such as physiotherapy or surgery if you have any long-term problems caused by polio."
Complications of polio,"Polio can cause long-term or lifelong difficulties.
Some people may be permanently paralysed, and others may have problems that need long-term treatment and support.
This can include:
muscle weakness
problems with your joints
swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)
If you've had polio before, you may develop symptoms again or your symptoms may get worse, sometimes decades later. This is called post-polio syndrome."
Polycystic ovaries,"Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles that are up to 8mm (approximately 0.3in) in size. 
The follicles are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. In PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place.
It's difficult to know exactly how many women have PCOS, but it's thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.
More than half of these women do not have any symptoms."
Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"If you have signs and symptoms of PCOS, they'll usually become apparent during your late teens or early 20s.
They can include:
irregular periods or no periods at all
difficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or no ovulation
excessive hair growth (hirsutism) – usually on the face, chest, back or buttocks
weight gain
thinning hair and hair loss from the head
oily skin or acne
PCOS is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels."
What causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?,"The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families.
It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body.
Many women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this.
This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone.
Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces."
Treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"There's no cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to a GP if you think you may have the condition.
If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet can make some symptoms better.
Medicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems.
If fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended.
This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone.
With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant."
Will I have a healthy pregnancy and baby?,"Most women with polyhydramnios will not have any significant problems during their pregnancy and will have a healthy baby.
But there is a slightly increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications, such as:
giving birth prematurely (before 37 weeks)
your waters breaking early
a problem with the position of the umbilical cord (prolapsed umbilical cord)
heavy bleeding after your baby is born because your womb has stretched
your baby having a health condition
You'll need extra check-ups to look for these problems. You'll usually be advised to give birth in hospital."
Symptoms of polyhydramnios,"Polyhydramnios tends to develop gradually and there may not be noticeable symptoms.
Some women have symptoms like:
breathlessness
heartburn
constipation
swollen ankles and feet
These can be common problems for pregnant women and are not necessarily caused by polyhydramnios. Talk to your midwife if you have these symptoms and you're worried.
In rare cases, fluid can build up around the baby quickly. Contact your midwife or doctor if your tummy gets bigger suddenly."
"Tests, checks and treatments if you have polyhydramnios","During the rest of your pregnancy, you'll probably have:
extra antenatal appointments and ultrasound scans to check for any health conditions that might affect you or your baby
tests to look for causes of polyhydramnios, such as a blood test for diabetes in pregnancy or amniocentesis (where some amniotic fluid is removed and tested)
treatment for the underlying cause, if it's found, for example, changes to your diet or possibly medicine if you have diabetes
Sometimes you may need treatment to reduce the amount of fluid. Some may be drained with a needle or you may be given medicine to help stop more fluid being produced.
Your midwife or doctor may also talk to you about any changes to your birth plan."
Things you can do if you have polyhydramnios,"If you've been told you have polyhydramnios:
try not to worry, remember polyhydramnios is not usually a sign of something serious
get plenty of rest, if you work you might consider starting your maternity leave early
speak to your doctor or midwife about your birth plan, including what to do if your waters break or labour starts earlier than expected
talk to your midwife or doctor if you have any concerns about yourself or your baby, for example if you get any new symptoms, feel very uncomfortable or your tummy gets bigger suddenly
You may find it useful to speak to other women who've had polyhydramnios. You could try joining an online forum such as the NCT HealthUnlocked forum."
Labour and giving birth if you have polyhydramnios,"You'll normally be advised to give birth in hospital. This is so any equipment or treatment needed for you or your baby is easily available.
You can usually wait for labour to start naturally. Sometimes induction (starting labour with medicine) or a caesarean section (an operation to deliver your baby) may be needed if there's a risk to you or your baby.
You'll probably pass a lot of fluid when you give birth – this is normal and nothing to worry about. Your baby's heartbeat may also need to be watched closely during labour.
After giving birth, your baby will have an examination to check they're healthy and they may have some tests. For example, a tube may be passed down their throat to check for a problem with their gut."
Causes of polyhydramnios,"It's often unclear why too much fluid sometimes builds up during pregnancy, but it can be caused by:
a twin or multiple pregnancy
diabetes in the mother – including diabetes caused by pregnancy (gestational diabetes)
a blockage in the baby's gut (gut atresia)
an infection during pregnancy
the baby's blood cells being attacked by the mother's blood cells (rhesus disease)
your baby having a genetic condition
Most babies whose mothers have polyhydramnios will be healthy. Speak to your doctor or midwife if you're concerned or have any questions."
Symptoms of polymorphic light eruption,"An itchy or burning rash appears within hours, or up to 2 to 3 days after exposure to sunlight.
It lasts for up to 2 weeks, healing without scarring.
The rash usually appears on the parts of the skin exposed to sunlight, typically the head, neck, chest and arms.
The face is not always affected.
The rash
Credit:
The rash can take many different forms (polymorphic):
you may get crops of 2mm to 5mm raised, pink or red spots, but redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin
some people get blisters that turn into larger, dry patches – it looks a bit like eczema
less commonly, the patches look like a target or ""bulls-eye"" (it looks a bit like erythema multiforme)
Polymorphic light eruption can be easily mistaken for heat rash (prickly heat).
Prickly heat is caused by warm weather or overheating, rather than sunlight or UV light.
The skin in prickly heat does not ""harden"" or desensitise, as it can do in polymorphic light eruption.
Polymorphic light eruption is thought to affect about 10% to 15% of the UK population."
Sunlight exposure,"The rash may be a rare occurrence or may happen every time the skin is exposed to sunlight. It ranges from mild to severe.
Sometimes as little as 20 minutes of sun exposure is enough to cause the problem, and it can even develop through thin clothing or if you're sitting near a window.
But for most people with polymorphic light eruption, the rash develops after several hours outside on a sunny day.
If further sun is avoided, the rash may settle and disappear without a trace within a couple of weeks.
It may or may not return when skin is re-exposed to sunlight.
If the skin is exposed to more sunlight before the rash has cleared up, it'll probably get much worse and spread.
For many people with polymorphic skin eruption, the rash appears every spring and remains a problem throughout summer before settling down by autumn."
Who's affected,"Polymorphic light eruption is more common in women than men.
It particularly affects people who have white skin, although it can also affect those with brown and black skin.
It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40, although it sometimes affects children."
Causes of polymorphic light eruption,"Polymorphic light eruption is thought to be caused by UV light altering a substance in the skin, which the immune system reacts to, resulting in the skin becoming inflamed.
It's not passed down through families, but about 1 in 5 people with the condition have an affected relative as it's a fairly common condition.
It's not infectious, so there's no risk of catching polymorphic light eruption from another person."
Treatments for polymorphic light eruption,"There's no cure for polymorphic light eruption, but using sunscreens and careful avoidance of the sun will help you manage the rash.
Avoid the sun, particularly between 11am and 3pm when the sun's rays are at their strongest, and wear protective clothing when outdoors (unless your doctor has advised you to try hardening your skin).
Introduce your skin to sunlight gradually in the spring.
Sunscreen
You may be prescribed sunscreens to help prevent the rash developing.
Use a sunscreen that is SPF 50 or above with a UVA rating of 4 or 5 stars. Apply sunscreen thickly and evenly around 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun
Reapply every 2 hours and straight after you've dried yourself off after swimming.
Steroid creams and ointments 
A GP can prescribe corticosteroid (steroid) cream or ointment that's only applied when the rash appears.
You should apply it sparingly, as often as the GP advises. Do not apply it when there's no rash.
Desensitisation or UV treatment
It's sometimes possible to increase the resistance of your skin to the sun.
This involves visiting a hospital dermatology department 3 times a week for 4 to 6 weeks in the spring.
Your skin is gradually exposed to a little more UV light every visit to try to build up your skin's resistance.
The effects of desensitisation are lost in the winter, so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.
Hardening or toughening
A GP or dermatologist may advise you to try increasing the resistance of your skin at home.
This is known as ""hardening"" and involves going outside for short periods in the spring to build up your resistance.
You might find the time is as short as a few minutes at first, but you may be able to gradually build up to longer times.
You'll have to be careful not to overdo it but, as you begin to understand more about how much light triggers your rash, you'll be able to judge how long to stay out.
Like desensitisation, the effects of hardening are lost in the winter, so you'll have to build up your resistance again in the spring.
Vitamin D
People with polymorphic light eruption are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency, as a certain amount of sun exposure is needed to make your own vitamin D.
A GP can advise whether you need treatment with vitamin D supplements."
Outlook,"Many people with polymorphic light eruption find their skin improves over the years.
Your skin may harden (become more resistant to sunlight) during the summer, which means more sun can be tolerated without your skin reacting.
The rash may even eventually clear up on its own, although this is unusual.
Hardening of the skin does not always happen, and some people with very sensitive skin may even get the rash in the winter.
For these people, it may be a long-term condition to manage with lifestyle changes and creams."
Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica,"The main symptom is muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes.
Other symptoms may include:
extreme tiredness
loss of appetite
weight loss
depression
See a GP if you have pain and stiffness for more than a week. They'll try to find out what's causing it.
Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.
These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed."
Causes of polymyalgia rheumatica,"The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible.
Polymyalgia rheumatica is an age-related condition. Most people diagnosed with it are over 65, and it's very rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men."
Treating polymyalgia rheumatica,"A steroid medicine called prednisolone is the main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. It's used to help relieve the symptoms.
To start with, you may be prescribed a moderate dose of prednisolone, which will be gradually reduced over time.
Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need a course of steroid treatment that lasts for 12 months to 2 years to prevent their symptoms returning."
Temporal arteritis,"Up to 1 in 5 people with polymyalgia rheumatica develop a more serious condition called temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis), where the arteries in the head and neck become inflamed.
Symptoms of temporal arteritis can include:
a new or frequent headache that usually develops suddenly (your scalp may also feel sore or tender)
pain in the jaw muscles or tongue when eating or talking
problems with sight, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes
If you have any of these symptoms, contact a GP immediately, go to 111.nhs.uk or call NHS 111.
Unlike polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis requires immediate medical attention. It can lead to serious problems like stroke or blindness if not treated quickly."
Check if you have pompholyx,"Pompholyx causes itchy blisters on the hands or feet that come and go. The symptoms usually last 2 to 3 weeks at a time.
The first symptom is often a burning or prickling feeling in the affected area.
Fluid-filled blisters then appear on the skin. These are usually very itchy and may leak fluid.
Credit:


When the blisters go away, the skin may be dry, cracked and sore. Sometimes it might bleed.
Pompholyx most often affects the fingers and palms.
Credit:
It can also affect the toes and soles of the feet.
Credit:"
Treatments for pompholyx,"Pompholyx is usually a long-term condition that comes and goes over time. Treatment can help control the symptoms.
The main treatments for pompholyx are:
moisturisers (emollients) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry
steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids) – used for a few weeks at a time to reduce irritation and soreness
If the blisters leak fluid, a GP may suggest soaking your skin in potassium permanganate solution. This helps dry the blisters and reduces the risk of them getting infected.
If the blisters become infected, a GP may prescribe antibiotics.
Treatments from a specialist
If your symptoms are severe or treatment is not helping, a GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).
A dermatologist may recommend other treatments, such as:
steroid tablets
treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light
other medicines, such as alitretinoin"
Things you can do to ease symptoms of pompholyx,"If you have pompholyx, your skin may get irritated easily. There are some things you can try to see if they help.
Do
wash your hands with warm (not hot or cold) water and use a moisturiser (emollient) soap substitute instead of regular soap
wear protective gloves (ideally with a cotton lining) when using chemicals like shampoos, cleansers and detergents
wear socks, tights or stockings made from cotton or silk, rather than nylon
wear shoes made from leather, rather than plastic or rubber
avoid anything you think causes your symptoms, such as cleansers or detergents
Don’t
do not burst your blisters
A pharmacist can help with pompholyx
If your skin gets very itchy and it affects your sleep, ask a pharmacist about antihistamines that make you drowsy (sedating antihistamines).
If you take these before going to bed, they can help you get to sleep.
Find a pharmacy"
What causes pompholyx,"It's not clear exactly what causes pompholyx.
Certain things are thought to cause symptoms in some people, including:
contact with strong chemicals like soaps, cleansers and detergents
an allergy or sensitivity to certain metals, such as nickel or cobalt
getting your hands wet regularly – for example, if you’re a hairdresser
stress
heat and sweat
Information:
If you notice something causes your symptoms, avoiding it as much as possible may help keep your symptoms under control."
Symptoms of post-herpetic neuralgia,"The main symptom of post-herpetic neuralgia is intermittent or continuous nerve pain in an area of your skin previously affected by shingles.
The pain may come and go or be continuous. It can be described as burning, stabbing, shooting, aching, throbbing or like electric shocks.
The affected area may also:
feel intensely itchy
be more sensitive to pain than usual
feel painful as a result of something that would not normally hurt, such as a light touch or cool breeze"
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you have ongoing pain after having shingles. They can advise you about treatment options, including medicines you can only get on prescription."
Treatments for post-herpetic neuralgia,"Medicines can ease the symptoms of post-herpetic neuralgia, although they may not relieve the pain completely.
Widely available painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, do not usually help, so your doctor may prescribe a different type of painkiller.
Some medicines used to treat depression also work for nerve pain and are sometimes used for post-herpetic neuralgia.

Read more about treatments for post-herpetic neuralgia"
Causes of post-herpetic neuralgia,"The varicella zoster virus causes both chickenpox and shingles.
In post-herpetic neuralgia, the virus causes inflammation of the nerves under the skin of the affected area. Neuralgia is a medical term for pain resulting from nerve inflammation or damage.
It's not clear why some people with shingles develop post-herpetic neuralgia, but increasing age, pain during the early stage of shingles and severe pain throughout an episode of shingles are all associated with an increased risk of the condition."
Preventing post-herpetic neuralgia,"There's no definite way to prevent post-herpetic neuralgia. But if shingles is treated early with antiviral medicine the risk of complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia is reduced.
If you develop symptoms such as pain or a rash that suggests shingles, see your GP as soon as possible to discuss taking an antiviral medicine.
Having the shingles vaccine will help you avoid getting the infection in the first place. If you've had shingles before, the vaccine will also reduce your risk of getting it again.
The shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:
people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023
people aged 70 to 79
people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system"
When post-mortems are carried out,"A post-mortem examination will be carried out if it's been requested by:
a coroner – because the cause of death is unknown, or following a sudden, violent or unexpected death
a hospital doctor – to find out more about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research and understanding
There are 2 different types of post-mortem.
Coroner's post-mortem examination
A coroner is a judicial officer responsible for investigating deaths in certain situations.
Coroners are usually lawyers or doctors with a minimum of 5 years' experience.
In most cases, a doctor or the police refer a death to the coroner. 
A death may be referred to the coroner if:
it's unexpected, such as the sudden death of a baby from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
it's violent, unnatural or suspicious, such as a suicide or drug overdose
it's the result of an accident or injury
it might have been caused by substances the person was exposed to at work (an industrial disease)
it occurred during or soon after a hospital procedure, such as surgery
the person was not seen during the last 28 days before they died or any time after they died by a doctor who can issue a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD), which is a document that allows the death to be registered
the cause of death is unknown
The main aim of a post-mortem requested by a coroner is to find out how someone died and decide whether an inquest is needed.
An inquest is a legal investigation into the circumstances surrounding a person's death.
If someone related to you has died and their death has been referred to a coroner, you won't be asked to give consent (permission) for a post-mortem to take place.
This is because the coroner is required by law to carry out a post-mortem when a death is suspicious, sudden or unnatural.
A coroner may decide to hold an inquest after a post-mortem has been completed. Samples of organs and tissues may need to be retained until after the inquest has finished.
If the death occurred in suspicious circumstances, samples may also need to be kept by the police as evidence for a longer period.
In some cases, samples may need to be kept for a number of months, or even years.
The coroner's office will discuss the situation with you if, following an inquest, tissue samples need to be retained for a certain length of time.
Hospital post-mortem examination
Post-mortems are sometimes requested by hospital doctors to provide more information about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research.
Sometimes the partner or relative of the deceased person will request a hospital post-mortem to find out more about the cause of death.
Hospital post-mortems can only be carried out with consent. Sometimes a person may have given their consent before they died.
If this isn't the case, a person close to the deceased can give their consent for a post-mortem to take place.
Hospital post-mortems may be limited to particular areas of the body, such as the head, chest or abdomen.
When you're asked to give your consent, this will be discussed with you.
During the post-mortem, only the organs or tissue you have agreed to can be removed for examination.
The HTA recommends you should be given at least 24 hours to consider your decision about the post-mortem examination.
You should also be given the details of someone to contact in case you change your mind."
What happens during a post-mortem,"A post-mortem will be carried out as soon as possible, usually within 2 to 3 working days of a person's death.
In some cases, it may be possible for it to take place within 24 hours.
Depending upon when the examination is due to take place, you may be able to see the body before the post-mortem is carried out.
The post-mortem takes place in an examination room that looks similar to an operating theatre. The examination room will be licensed and inspected by the HTA.
During the procedure, the deceased person's body is opened and the organs removed for examination. A diagnosis can sometimes be made by looking at the organs.
Some organs need to be examined in close detail during a post-mortem. These investigations can take several weeks to complete.
The pathologist will return the organs to the body after the post-mortem has been completed.
If you wish, you'll usually be able to view the body after the examination.
Once release papers have been issued, the undertakers you have appointed will be able to collect the body from the mortuary in preparation for the funeral."
What happens after a post-mortem,"After a post-mortem, the pathologist writes a report of the findings.
If the post-mortem was requested by the coroner, the coroner or coroner's officer will let you know the cause of death determined by the pathologist.
If you want a full copy of the pathologist's report, you can request this from the coroner's office, but there may be a fee.
In some cases, the report may be sent to a hospital doctor or GP so they can discuss it with you.
If the post-mortem was requested by a hospital doctor, you'll have to request the results from the hospital where the post-mortem took place. You may be charged a small fee for this.
You can arrange to discuss the results with the doctor in charge of the deceased person's care while they were in hospital (if applicable), or with your GP.
The HTA website gives further information about what happens before, during and after the examination."
The Human Tissue Authority,"The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) ensures that human tissue is used safely, ethically and with proper consent.
It regulates organisations that remove, store and use tissue for research, medical treatment, post-mortem examination, teaching and public display.
All premises where post-mortems are carried out must be licensed by the HTA."
Bereavement support,"For many people, understanding the reason for a loved one's death helps them come to terms with their loss.
Talking and sharing your feelings with someone can also help.
Some people find that relying on the support of family and friends is the best way to cope.
Your GP will be able to put you in touch with bereavement services in your area.
You can also contact the national Cruse helpline on 0808 808 1677 or at a local Cruse centre.

Symptoms of post-polio syndrome,"Post-polio syndrome can include a wide range of symptoms that usually develop gradually over time, including:
persistent fatigue (extreme tiredness)
muscle weakness
shrinking muscles
muscle and joint pain
sleep apnoea
The condition can have a significant impact on everyday life, making it very difficult to move about and carry out certain tasks and activities.
The symptoms tend to get gradually worse over many years, but this happens very slowly and treatment may help slow it down further.
Post-polio syndrome is rarely life-threatening, although some people develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems, such as chest infections.
Read more about the symptoms of post-polio syndrome and diagnosing post-polio syndrome."
Who's affected,"Post-polio syndrome only affects people who have had polio. It usually develops 15 or more years after the infection.
It's not known exactly how many people who survived polio when they were younger are or will be affected by post-polio syndrome. Estimates vary from as low as 15% to as high as 80%."
What causes post-polio syndrome?,"The exact cause of post-polio syndrome is unclear. It's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it.
The leading theory is that it's the result of the gradual deterioration of nerve cells in the spinal cord (motor neurones) that were damaged by the polio virus. This would explain why the condition can take years to appear.
Post-polio syndrome isn't contagious. The theory that the polio virus may lie dormant in your body, causing post-polio syndrome when it becomes reactivated at a later stage, has not been proven.
It's not clear why only some people who have had polio develop post-polio syndrome. However, those who had severe polio when they were younger may be more likely to develop the condition."
How post-polio syndrome is treated,"There's currently no cure for post-polio syndrome, but support and a range of treatments are available to help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life.
Some of the ways that symptoms of post-polio syndrome may be managed include:
rest and exercise – such as learning to stop activities before becoming exhausted
mobility aids – such as walking sticks or scooters
weight control and healthy eating – to avoid putting unnecessary strain on muscles and joints
painkilling medication – to help relieve muscle or joint pain
psychological support – such as discussions with a GP, on an online forum, or in a local support group
Read more about treating post-polio syndrome."
Help and support,"The British Polio Fellowship is a leading charity for people affected by polio and post-polio syndrome. It provides a range of useful resources, information and services.
You can visit the British Polio Fellowship website, or phone them on 0800 043 1935."
Symptoms of postpartum psychosis,"Symptoms usually start suddenly within the first 2 weeks after giving birth - often within hours or days of giving birth. More rarely, they can develop several weeks after the baby is born.
Symptoms can include:
hallucinations – hearing, seeing, smelling or feeling things that are not there
delusions – suspicions, fears, thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true
mania – feeling very ""high"" or overactive, for example, talking and thinking too much or too quickly, restlessness or losing normal inhibitions
a low mood – showing signs of depression, being withdrawn or tearful, lacking energy, having a loss of appetite, anxiety, agitation or trouble sleeping
sometimes a mixture of both a manic mood and a low mood - or rapidly changing moods
feeling very confused"
When to get medical help,"Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that should be treated as a medical emergency. It can get worse rapidly and the illness can risk the safety of the mother and baby.
See a GP immediately if you think you, or someone you know, may have developed symptoms of postpartum psychosis. You should request an urgent assessment on the same day.
You can call 111 if you cannot speak to a GP or do not know what to do next. Your midwife or health visitor may also be able to help you access care.
Call your crisis team if you already have a care plan because you've been assessed as being at high risk of developing postpartum psychosis.
Go to A&E or call 999 if you think you, or someone you know, may be in danger of imminent harm.
Be aware that if you have postpartum psychosis, you may not realise you're ill. Your partner, family or friends may spot the signs and have to take action."
Treating postpartum psychosis,"Treatment usually happens in hospital. Ideally, this would be with your baby in a specialist psychiatric unit called a mother and baby unit (MBU). But you may be admitted to a general psychiatric ward until an MBU is available.
Most people with postpartum psychosis make a full recovery as long as they receive the right treatment.
Medicine
You may be prescribed 1 or more of the following:
antipsychotics – to help with manic and psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations
mood stabilisers (for example, lithium) – to stabilise your mood and prevent symptoms recurring
antidepressants – to help ease symptoms if you have significant symptoms of depression and may be used alongside a mood stabiliser
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes recommended if all other treatment options have failed, or when the situation is thought to be life threatening.
Psychological therapy
As you move forward with your recovery, you may benefit from seeing a therapist for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave.
Other forms of support
It can be hard to come to terms with the experience of postpartum psychosis as you recover.
Talking to peers and others with lived experience of the illness may be helpful. Some inpatient units and communities have peer support workers who have experienced the illness, and you can also access support through charities.
Action on Postpartum Psychosis offers online chat or in-person meetings to support those affected by postpartum psychosis."
Causes,"It's not clear what causes postpartum psychosis, but you're more at risk if you:
already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia
have a family history of mental illness, particularly postpartum psychosis (even if you have no history of mental illness)
developed postpartum psychosis after a previous pregnancy"
Reducing the risk of postpartum psychosis,"If you're at high risk of developing postpartum psychosis, you should have specialist care during or before pregnancy and be seen by a perinatal psychiatrist.
You should have a pre-birth planning meeting at around 32 weeks of pregnancy with everyone involved in your care. This includes your partner, family or friends, mental health professionals, your midwife, obstetrician, health visitor and GP. 
This is to make sure that everyone is aware of your risk of postpartum psychosis. You should all agree on a plan for your care during pregnancy and after you've given birth.
You'll get a written copy of your care plan explaining how you and your family can get help quickly if you become ill, as well as strategies you can use to reduce your risk of becoming ill.
In the first few weeks after your baby is born, you should have regular home visits from a midwife, health visitor and mental health nurse."
Recovering from postpartum psychosis,"The most severe symptoms tend to last 2 to 12 weeks, and it can take 6 to 12 months or more to recover completely from the condition. But with treatment and the right support, most people with postpartum psychosis do make a full recovery.
An episode of postpartum psychosis is sometimes followed by a period of depression, anxiety and low confidence. It might take a while for you to come to terms with what happened. 
Some mothers have difficulty bonding with their baby after an episode of postpartum psychosis, or feel some sadness at missing out on time with their baby. With support from your partner, family, friends and your mental health team, or talking to others with lived experience, you can overcome these feelings.
Many people who've had postpartum psychosis go on to have more children. Although there is about a 1 in 2 chance you will have another episode after a future pregnancy, you should be able to get help quickly with the right care and the risks can be reduced with appropriate interventions."
Support for postpartum psychosis,"Postpartum psychosis can have a big impact on your life, but support is available.
It might help to speak to others who've had the same condition, or connect with a charity.

Check if it's postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS),"Certain symptoms of postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) happen when you stand up and get better when you lie down, such as:
dizziness or light-headedness
fainting or almost fainting
noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)
chest pain
shortness of breath
shaking and sweating
You may also get other symptoms, such as:
problems with your stomach or digestion, such as feeling sick, being sick, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating and tummy pain
headaches and problems with your sight, such as blurred vision or tunnel vision
your hands and feet looking purple – this may be more difficult to see if you have brown or black skin
weakness and extreme tiredness (fatigue), not being able to do much exercise, and sleeping badly
problems with thinking, memory and concentration (brain fog)
Information:
These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as low blood pressure. Having them does not mean you definitely have PoTS."
Causes of postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS),"It's not clear what causes postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS). It can develop suddenly or gradually over time.
Some people have mild symptoms, while for others it can have a big impact on their everyday lives.
You may find your symptoms are worse in the morning, and they may change from day to day.
Some things can make your symptoms worse, such as:
feeling hot
eating, especially refined carbohydrates like white bread
not drinking enough fluids
drinking alcohol
resting too much
exercise
being on your period"
How postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is diagnosed,"If you have symptoms of postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), a GP may check your blood pressure and heart rate before and after you stand up.
If they think you may have PoTS, they'll refer you to a specialist.
The specialist may perform more tests, such as:
blood tests
pee (urine) tests
heart and blood pressure tests, such as an echocardiogram, ECG, and 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate monitoring
It can take time for people to be diagnosed with PoTS, as the symptoms are similar to other conditions."
Treatments for postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS),"If you're diagnosed with postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), finding the right treatment for you can take time.
A specialist may suggest making changes to your lifestyle, such as eating and drinking at regular times and trying to manage stress, first.
You may also need to try several different medicines or combinations of medicines.
You may be prescribed medicines to help control your symptoms, such as beta blockers, steroids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)."
Things you can do if you have postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS),"If you have postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), there are things you can try to help ease your symptoms.
If you suddenly feel faint or dizzy, you can try lying down and raising your legs until you feel better.
If you cannot lie down, you can try:
crossing your legs with 1 in front of the other while standing
rocking up and down on your toes
clenching your buttocks and tummy muscles
clenching your fists
Making changes to your lifestyle may also help with PoTS.
Do
try to avoid the things that trigger your symptoms
drink plenty of fluids until your pee is pale
try gentle exercise, such as walking, jogging, pilates and swimming
raise the head of your bed so you're not lying completely flat
wear support tights to improve blood flow
Don’t
do not stand up for too long
do not get up too quickly after lying down – sit for a while before standing up

Symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome,"Typical symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include:
an excessive appetite and overeating, which can easily lead to dangerous weight gain
restricted growth (children are much shorter than average)
floppiness caused by weak muscles (hypotonia)
learning difficulties
lack of sexual development
behavioural challenges, such as emotional outbursts and physical aggression
Read more about symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome."
Causes of Prader-Willi syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by some missing genetic material in a group of genes on chromosome number 15.
This leads to a number of problems and is thought to affect part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates growth and appetite.
This may explain some of the typical features of Prader-Willi syndrome, such as delayed growth and persistent hunger.
The genetic cause happens purely by chance, and boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds can be affected.
It's extremely rare for parents to have more than 1 child with Prader-Willi syndrome.
Read more about the causes of Prader-Willi syndrome."
Diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome can usually be confirmed by carrying out genetic testing.
Genetic testing may be recommended if a child has the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome. Babies who are very floppy at birth may also be tested.
Read more about diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome."
Managing Prader-Willi syndrome,"There's no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and associated difficulties.
This includes managing the person's excessive appetite and behavioural challenges.
One of the most important parts of caring for someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is to try to maintain a normal weight.
They should have a healthy, balanced diet, avoiding sweet treats and high-calorie items right from the start.
If someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is allowed to eat as much as they want, they'll quickly become dangerously overweight.
Someone with the syndrome can eat much more than other people and still feel hungry.
Limiting food intake can be very challenging. People with Prader-Willi syndrome may become frustrated when they want extra food, and their hunger can make them hide or steal food.
Read more about managing Prader-Willi syndrome."
Long-term problems caused by Prader-Willi syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome itself is not life-threatening. But compulsive eating and weight gain can cause young adults with the syndrome to develop serious obesity-related conditions such as:
type 2 diabetes
heart failure
breathing difficulties
If their diet is well controlled and they do not become overweight, adults can have a good quality of life and probably a normal life expectancy.
Many adults with Prader-Willi syndrome take part in activities such as voluntary or part-time work but it's unlikely they'll be able to live fully independent lives.
The increased appetite also means there's a higher risk of choking on food, so carers are advised to learn what to do if someone is choking."
PWSA UK,The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association UK (PWSA UK) provides information and support for people whose lives are affected by the syndrome. You can call the PWSA UK helpline on 01332 365676.
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If your child has Prader-Willi syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat Prader-Willi syndrome. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of pre-eclampsia,"Early signs of pre-eclampsia include having high blood pressure (hypertension) and protein in your urine (proteinuria). 
It's unlikely that you'll notice these signs, but they should be picked up during your routine antenatal appointments.
In some cases, further symptoms can develop, including:
severe headache
vision problems, such as blurring or flashing
pain just below the ribs
vomiting
sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet
If you notice any symptoms of pre-eclampsia, seek medical advice immediately by calling your midwife, GP surgery or NHS 111.
Although many cases are mild, the condition can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby if it's not monitored and treated. 
The earlier pre-eclampsia is diagnosed and monitored, the better the outlook for mother and baby."
Who's affected?,"There are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia, such as:
having diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease before you were pregnant
having an autoimmune condition, such as lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome
having high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy
Other things that can slightly increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia include:
a family history of pre-eclampsia
being 40 years old or more
it's more than 10 years since your last pregnancy
expecting multiple babies (twins or triplets)
having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more
If you have 2 or more of these together, your chances are higher.
If you're thought to be at a high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, you may be advised to take a 75 to 150mg daily dose of aspirin from the 12th week of pregnancy until your baby is born."
What causes pre-eclampsia?,"Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it's thought to occur when there's a problem with the placenta, the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's."
Treating pre-eclampsia,"If you're diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, you should be referred for an assessment by a specialist, usually in hospital.
While in hospital, you'll be monitored closely to determine how severe the condition is and whether a hospital stay is needed.
The only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, so you'll usually be monitored regularly until it's possible for your baby to be delivered.
This will normally be at around 37 to 38 weeks of pregnancy, but it may be earlier in more severe cases.
At this point, labour may be started artificially (induced) or you may have a caesarean section.
You'll be offered medicine to lower your blood pressure while you wait for your baby to be delivered."
Complications,"Although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there's a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and her baby.
There's a risk that the mother will develop fits called ""eclampsia"". These fits can be life threatening for the mother and baby, but they're rare."
Check if it's a pressure ulcer,"Pressure ulcers usually form on bony parts of the body, such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone.
Symptoms of a pressure ulcer include:
discoloured patches of skin that do not change colour when pressed – the patches are usually red on white skin, or purple or blue on black or brown skin
a patch of skin that feels warm, spongy or hard
pain or itchiness in the affected area of skin
The ulcers usually develop gradually, but can sometimes appear over a few hours.
They can become a blister or open wound. If left untreated, they can get worse and eventually reach deeper layers of skin or muscle and bone.

Treatments for pressure ulcers,"How a pressure ulcer is treated depends on how severe it is.
Changing position and moving regularly is important to help relieve pressure on the ulcers and help stop new ones forming.
Other treatments include:
specially designed mattresses and cushions
dressings to protect the ulcer and help it heal
creams and ointments
antibiotics if the ulcer is infected
cleaning the ulcer
If the pressure ulcer is severe or other treatments have not worked, you may need to have surgery to clean and close the ulcer."
Causes of pressure ulcers,"Pressure ulcers are caused by something putting pressure on or rubbing your skin.
It can happen to anyone, but it's usually if you have problems moving, as this can mean the weight of your body is always putting pressure on the same areas of skin, which can damage it.
You have a higher chance of getting a pressure ulcer if you:
have problems moving
have had a pressure ulcer before
have been seriously ill in intensive care or have recently had surgery
are underweight
have swollen, sweaty or broken skin
have poor circulation or fragile skin
have problems feeling sensation or pain"
Things you can do to prevent pressure ulcers,"If you're being cared for at home, there are things you and your care team can do to lower your chances of getting a pressure ulcer.
Do
change position regularly
use specially designed mattresses and cushions
check your skin every day for symptoms of a pressure ulcer
try to stay active, if possible
eat a healthy, balanced diet
Don’t
do not smoke
Information:
If you're being cared for at home and think you're at risk of getting pressure ulcers, you can ask a GP for a risk assessment so your care team can make a plan to prevent them."
Things you can try yourself to reduce a painful erection,"There are things you can try to reduce your erection.
Do
try to go for a pee
have a warm bath or shower
drink lots of water
go for a gentle walk
try exercises, such as squats or running on the spot
take painkillers like paracetamol if you need to
Don’t
do not apply ice packs or cold water to your penis – this can make things worse, particularly if you have sickle cell disease
do not have sex or masturbate – it will not make your erection go away
do not drink alcohol
do not smoke"
Hospital treatment for priapism,"Treatments to help reduce your erection include:
using a needle to drain blood from your penis, which is done while the area is numbed under local anaesthetic
tablets or injections directly into your penis
surgery to drain the blood through a tiny cut, done while you're asleep under general anaesthetic"
Causes of priapism,"Priapism often affects people with sickle cell disease.
Other causes include:
blood-thinning medicines, like warfarin
some antidepressants
drugs, like cannabis and cocaine
some medicines for high blood pressure
other blood disorders, like thalassaemia and leukaemia
some treatments for erectile dysfunction"
Symptoms of PBC,"PBC does not always cause symptoms, but some people may experience:
bone and joint aches
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
itchy skin
dry eyes and mouth
pain or discomfort in the upper right side of their tummy
Read more about the symptoms of PBC"
How PBC is diagnosed,"Many people are only diagnosed with PBC after having a routine blood test for another reason. PBC can usually be diagnosed just using blood tests.
Once PBC is diagnosed, you'll also need an ultrasound scan to help rule out other problems with your bile ducts and assess your liver.
A liver biopsy is occasionally recommended to assess your liver and help doctors decide on the best treatment.
This involves safely removing a small sample of liver tissue so it can be studied under a microscope."
Causes of PBC,"Bile is a liquid produced inside the liver that's used to help digest fats, absorb certain vitamins and remove waste products from the body. It passes out of the liver through small tubes called bile ducts.
In PBC, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakenly attacks the bile ducts.
It's not clear why this happens, but it's thought to be caused by a combination of subtle differences in how the immune system works.
The bile ducts become damaged and injured, causing bile to build up in the liver. This further damages the liver and may lead to scarring (cirrhosis)."
How PBC is treated,"PBC is a progressive condition, which means the damage to the liver can steadily get worse over time.
The rate at which PBC progresses varies between individuals. Sometimes, it can take decades.
Without treatment, the liver can become so badly damaged that it no longer works properly. This is known as liver failure and can be fatal.
Current treatments such as ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid can help slow down liver damage caused by PBC.
Other medicines can help relieve the itchiness associated with PBC. Occasionally, if the liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be needed.
Read more about treating PBC"
Complications of PBC,"If PBC is not treated or reaches an advanced stage, there may be other problems including:
osteoporosis – a condition in which the bones become weak and brittle
portal hypertension – increased blood pressure inside the blood vessels in your abdomen
ascites – a build-up of fluid in your abdomen (stomach) and around your intestines
vitamin deficiencies – including vitamins A, D, E and K
a slightly increased risk of developing liver cancer"
Issues to be aware of,"If you're considering trying probiotics, there are a few issues you need to be aware of.
Probiotics are generally classed as food rather than medicine, which means they don't go through the rigorous testing medicines do.
Because of the way probiotics are regulated, we can't always be sure that:
the product actually contains the bacteria stated on the food label
the product contains enough bacteria to have an effect
the bacteria are able to survive long enough to reach your gut
There are many different types of probiotics that may have different effects on the body, and little is known about which types are best.
You may find a particular type of probiotic helps with one problem. But this doesn't mean it'll help other problems, or that other types of probiotic will work just as well.
And there's likely to be a huge difference between the pharmaceutical-grade probiotics that show promise in clinical trials and the yoghurts and supplements sold in shops.
If you have an existing health condition or a weakened immune system, you should talk to a doctor before taking any probiotic supplements."
How to make it easier to swallow pills,"Do
take pills with water – you can take some pills with other drinks or food. Always read the instruction leaflet
lean forward slightly when you swallow
practise swallowing with small sweets or bits of bread – try bigger pieces as swallowing gets easier
Don’t
do not throw pills towards the back of your throat
do not tip your head back too much when you swallow – this can make swallowing more difficult
do not crush pills, open capsules or alter your medicine without getting medical advice – this could stop the medicine working properly
Good pill swallowing techniques
Important
Do not try these techniques if you also have difficulty swallowing food and drink (not just pills), as you might choke. See a pharmacist or GP for advice.

A pharmacist can help if you cannot swallow pills,"A pharmacist can advise you about:
other versions of your medicine that might be available – for example, you might be able to get it as a liquid or dissolvable tablet
crushing, dividing or opening up tablets and capsules – this should only be done on their advice
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of swallowing problems,"Problems swallowing pills can be due to:
fear of choking – this can make your throat tense and narrow when you try to swallow
a dry mouth
general swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) – for example, due to a condition such as a stroke"
What causes PSP?,"PSP occurs when brain cells in certain parts of the brain are damaged as a result of a build-up of a protein called tau.
Tau occurs naturally in the brain and is usually broken down before it reaches high levels.
In people with PSP, it isn't broken down properly and forms harmful clumps in brain cells.
The amount of abnormal tau in the brain can vary among people with PSP, as can the location of these clumps. This means the condition can have a wide range of symptoms.
The condition has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic faults aren't inherited and the risk to other family members, including the children or siblings of someone with PSP, is very low."
PSP symptoms,"The symptoms of PSP usually get gradually worse over time.
At first, they can be similar to some other conditions, which makes it difficult to diagnose early on.
Some of the main symptoms of PSP include:
problems with balance and mobility, including frequent falls
changes in behaviour, such as irritability or apathy (lack of interest)
muscle stiffness
an inability to control eye and eyelid movement, including focusing on specific objects or looking up or down at something
slow, quiet or slurred speech
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
slowness of thought and some memory problems
The rate at which the symptoms progress can vary widely from person to person.
Read more about the symptoms of PSP."
Diagnosing PSP,"There's no single test for PSP. Instead, the diagnosis is based on the pattern of your symptoms.
Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease.
The large number of possible symptoms of PSP also makes it difficult to diagnose correctly and can mean it takes a while to get a definitive diagnosis.
You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language.
The diagnosis must be made or confirmed by a consultant with expertise in PSP. This will usually be a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves).
Read more about how PSP is diagnosed."
Treatments for PSP,"There's currently no cure for PSP, but research is continuing into new treatments that aim to relieve symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition.
Treatment currently focuses on relieving the symptoms while trying to make sure someone with PSP has the best possible quality of life.
As someone with PSP can be affected in many different ways, treatment and care is provided by a team of health and social care professionals working together.
Treatment will be tailored to meet the needs of each individual and may include:
medication to improve balance, stiffness and other symptoms
physiotherapy to help with movement and balance difficulties
speech and language therapy to help with speech or swallowing problems
occupational therapy to help improve the skills needed for daily activities
Botox (botulinum toxin injections) or special glasses to help with eye problems
feeding tubes to help manage dysphagia and avoid malnutrition or dehydration
Read more about how PSP is treated."
Outlook,"There's currently nothing that can be done to stop PSP gradually worsening, although research into new treatments gives hope that this may be possible in the future.
Good care and assistance can help someone with PSP to be more independent and enjoy a better quality of life, but the condition will eventually put them at risk of serious complications.
It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about what you'd like to happen when the condition reaches this stage.
Difficulty swallowing can cause choking or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia, which can be life threatening.
Help from a speech and language therapist at an early stage can lower this risk for as long as possible."
Sharing your information,"If you have PSP, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the NCARDRS register on GOV.UK"
Symptoms of prostate cancer,"Symptoms of prostate cancer do not usually appear until the prostate is large enough to affect the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra).
When this happens, you may notice things like:
an increased need to pee
straining while you pee
a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied
These symptoms should not be ignored, but they do not mean you have prostate cancer.
It's more likely they're caused by something else, such as prostate enlargement."
What is the prostate?,"The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis and is part of the male reproductive system.
About the size of a walnut, it's located between the penis and the bladder, and surrounds the urethra.
The main function of the prostate is to produce a thick white fluid that creates semen when mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles."
Causes of prostate cancer,"The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. But certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men aged 50 or older.
For reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in black men and less common in Asian men.
Men whose father or brother were affected by prostate cancer are at slightly increased risk themselves.
Recent research also suggests that obesity increases the risk of prostate cancer."
Tests for prostate cancer,"There's no single test for prostate cancer.
All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks that your doctor should discuss with you.
The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are:
blood tests
a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination, or DRE)
an MRI scan
a biopsy
Find out more about how prostate cancer is diagnosed"
Treating prostate cancer,"If you do have prostate cancer, you may not need treatment.
If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, your doctor may suggest either ""watchful waiting"" or ""active surveillance"".
The best option depends on your age and overall health. Both options involve carefully monitoring your condition.
Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages.
Treatments include:
surgically removing the prostate
radiotherapy – either on its own or alongside hormone therapy
Some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage, when the cancer has spread.
If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body and cannot be cured, treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.
All treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms, such as needing to use the toilet more urgently or more often.
For this reason, you may choose to delay treatment until there's a risk the cancer might spread.
Newer treatments, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.
Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy.
But the long-term effectiveness of these treatments is not known yet."
Living with prostate cancer,"As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.
Nevertheless, it can affect your life. As well as the possible side effects of treatment, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed.
You may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a GP and other people with prostate cancer.
Financial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work.

Prostate enlargement,"Prostate enlargement is a very common condition associated with ageing. More than 1 in 3 of all men over 50 will have some symptoms of prostate enlargement.
It's not known why the prostate gets bigger as you get older, but it is not caused by cancer and does not increase your risk of developing prostate cancer.
An enlarged prostate can put pressure on the urethra, which can affect how you urinate.
Signs of an enlarged prostate can include:
difficulty starting or stopping urinating
a weak flow of urine
straining when peeing
feeling like you're not able to fully empty your bladder
prolonged dribbling after you've finished peeing
needing to pee more frequently or more suddenly
waking up frequently during the night to pee
See your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to, your usual pattern of urination.
Simple measures such as reducing the amount you drink (especially tea, coffee and alcohol) before bed can sometimes help control the symptoms. Medicine can help reduce the size of your prostate and relax the muscles of your bladder.
In severe cases that do not get better with medicine, the inner part of the prostate can be surgically removed."
Prostatitis,"Prostatitis is where the prostate gland becomes inflamed (swollen). It's sometimes caused by a bacterial infection, although more often no infection can be found and it's not clear why it happened.
Unlike prostate enlargement or prostate cancer – which usually affect older men – prostatitis can develop in men of all ages. However, it's generally more common in men aged over 50.
Symptoms of prostatitis can include:
pain in the perineum (the area between the anus and scrotum), which is often made worse by prolonged sitting
pain in the pelvis, genitals, lower back and buttocks
pain when urinating
a frequent need to pee
difficulty urinating, such as problems starting to pee
pain when ejaculating
See your GP if you have these symptoms.
Prostatitis can be treated using a combination of painkillers and a type of medicine called an alpha-blocker, which can help to relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder neck. It can also sometimes be treated with antibiotics.
Most men will recover within a few weeks or months, although some will continue to have symptoms for longer."
Prostate cancer,"In the UK, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, with more than 45,000 new cases diagnosed every year.
It's not clear why it occurs, but your chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. The condition mainly affects men over 65, although men over 50 are also at risk.
The risk of developing prostate cancer is also increased depending on your:
ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among Black men than in White men, and is least common in Asian men
family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase your risk of developing it, and having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of prostate cancer
Early prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms.
If the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on your urethra, the symptoms of prostate cancer can be difficult to distinguish from those of prostate enlargement. They may include:
needing to pee more frequently, often during the night
needing to rush to the toilet
difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)
straining or taking a long time while peeing
weak flow
feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied
blood in urine or blood in semen
You should see your GP if you have these symptoms. It's much more likely to be prostate enlargement, but it's important to rule out cancer.
The outlook for prostate cancer is generally good because, unlike many other types of cancer, it usually progresses very slowly. Many men die with prostate cancer rather than as a result of having it.
Prostate cancer therefore does not always need to be treated immediately. Sometimes, it may initially just be monitored and only treated if it gets worse."
Check if you have prostatitis,"Symptoms of prostatitis can affect anyone with a prostate gland.
Symptoms may include:
pain when peeing, which may feel like stinging or burning
difficulty peeing or straining to pee
needing to pee more often than usual
pain in your penis, scrotum, testicles or bottom
pain when you ejaculation
high temperature"
Treatment for prostatitis,"Prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. You'll usually feel better within 2 weeks after starting treatment, but it may take several weeks for all your symptoms to get better.
Treatment for chronic prostatitis
If you've had symptoms of prostatitis for 3 months or longer (chronic prostatitis) you may be referred to a specialist (a urologist).
Treatment for chronic prostatitis may include:
antibiotics and other medicines to help with your symptoms
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or counselling
physiotherapy
alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, if this is available in your area"
Things you can do to help with prostatitis symptoms,"If you've been told you have prostatitis, there are some things you can do to help with the symptoms.
Do
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain
if you've been given antibiotics, finish the whole course, even if you feel better"
Causes of prostatitis,"Prostatitis is usually caused by an infection, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI).
It's not always known what causes long-term (chronic) prostatitis. It's thought that an infection or inflammation may cause it, and may be a combination of these things."
Why it happens,"People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells.
Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only takes about 3 to 7 days.
The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.
Although the process is not fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system.
The immune system is your body's defence against disease and infection, but it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake in people with psoriasis.
Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.
Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger.
Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.
The condition is not contagious, so it cannot be spread from person to person."
How psoriasis is diagnosed,"A GP can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.
You may be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions (dermatologist) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.
In rare cases, a small sample of skin called a biopsy will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope.
If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in arthritis (rheumatologist).
You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken."
Treating psoriasis,"There's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.
Your doctor will ask you about how much the condition is affecting your everyday life.
In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.
If these are not effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.
In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body."
Living with psoriasis,"Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.
For example, some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance.
It's also quite common to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.
Speak to a GP or your healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They can offer advice and further treatment if necessary.
There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as the Psoriasis Association, where you can speak to other people with the condition.

Check if you have psoriatic arthritis,"Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include:
pain, swelling and stiffness in 1 or more joints
swollen fingers or toes
your nails changing from their usual colour, or tiny dents or pits developing in your nails
feeling drained of energy
Symptoms can be worse first thing in the morning and may improve with exercise.
Some people may also get symptoms of psoriasis, such as dry scaly skin, at the same time.
Psoriatic arthritis can cause swelling of the fingers
Credit:"
What happens at your appointment,"If the GP thinks you may have psoriatic arthritis, they'll refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist).
Tests you may have include:
blood tests
joint fluid test – where fluid is removed from an affected joint and tested
X-rays, ultrasound scans and MRI scans"
Treatments for psoriatic arthritis,"Medicines are the main treatment for psoriatic arthritis. If a medicine does not help with your symptoms tell your doctor. Another medicine may work better for you.
Medicines for psoriatic arthritis
The medicines used to treat psoriatic arthritis include:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – they come as tablets, creams or gels and can help with mild symptoms
steroid injections – a steroid medicine is injected into a joint to help ease the pain
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) – used for moderate to severe symptoms, DMARDs can take several months to work so keep taking them even if you do not feel better straight away
biological treatments – usually given by injection, biological treatments can be used if DMARDs do not help
Other treatments for psoriatic arthritis
Your doctor may also refer you to a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or both.
A physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints and prevent joint damage.
An occupational therapist can discuss adjustments you can make at home and at work. For example, they may recommend equipment that makes certain tasks easier."
Things you can do to ease the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis,"There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis.
Do
exercise regularly – low impact exercises like swimming, walking and yoga can help strengthen and protect your joints
try to lose weight if you're overweight to reduce pressure on your joints
cut down on alcohol if you're taking medicines – alcohol can affect medicines
Don’t
do not smoke because it can make symptoms of psoriatic arthritis worse
do not use herbal remedies because they may interfere with any medicines you're taking"
Causes of psoriatic arthritis,"Some people with psoriasis get psoriatic arthritis.
It can sometimes develop after you've had psoriasis for many years.
Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue.
It's not clear why some people with psoriasis get psoriatic arthritis but others do not."
What conditions can psychiatrists treat?,"Mental health conditions that may be diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist include:
anxiety and panic attacks
phobias
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
personality disorders
schizophrenia 
depression and bipolar disorder
dementia and Alzheimer's disease
eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia
sleep disorders, such as insomnia
addictions, such as drug or alcohol misuse
Psychiatrists may also provide psychological support for people with long-term, painful or terminal physical health conditions."
Getting an appointment with a psychiatrist,"You'll usually need a referral from your GP or another doctor to see a psychiatrist on the NHS.
Your GP may refer you directly to a psychiatrist or to a member of a local mental health team, who can assess your needs and help determine if you need to see a psychiatrist or a different mental health professional.
If you are under 18, you may be referred to your local children and young people's mental health services.
You can also see a psychiatrist privately, although most private psychiatrists prefer a referral from your GP. Your GP may be able to recommend psychiatrists in your area. You can also try contacting a psychiatric clinic directly or using online psychiatry services.
You'll see a psychiatrist who specialises in the area of psychiatry most relevant to your situation. The main areas of expertise include:
childhood and adolescent psychiatry
general adult psychiatry
older person's psychiatry
learning disabilities
psychotherapy (talking therapies)
You can check the details of a psychiatrist, including their area of speciality, by looking on the medical register, a list of doctors in the UK.
If they have the letters MRCPsych (Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) or FRCPsych (Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) after their name, they're a current member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych)."
What happens during your appointments,"During your first appointment, your psychiatrist will carry out an initial assessment. They'll look at both your mental and physical health, and may ask:
about the problem that brought you to see them
general questions about your life and thoughts
to carry out a simple physical examination, such as checking your blood pressure – for example, before prescribing certain medications
for information from other sources, such as your GP, relatives and social workers
After assessing your condition, your psychiatrist may prescribe medication or recommend other treatments, such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
The number of times you need to see a psychiatrist and the length of each appointment will depend on your circumstances.
A psychiatrist may continue to manage your treatment or they may refer you to other community mental health services in your area. These services work in small units or clinics and aim to help people manage their illness so they can lead a normal life within the community."
Further information and support,"The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) has mental health information in a number of areas, including problems and disorders, support and treatment, and advice for parents or carers and young people."
Symptoms of depression,"Someone with depression feels sad and hopeless for most of the day, practically every day, and has no interest in anything. Getting through the day feels almost impossible.
Other typical symptoms of depression may include:
fatigue (exhaustion)
disturbed sleep
changes in appetite
feeling worthless and guilty
being unable to concentrate or being indecisive
thoughts of death or suicide
Doctors describe depression as mild, moderate or severe depending on your symptoms, how long it lasts and how much it affects your daily life.
Read more about the psychological, physical and social symptoms of clinical depression"
Symptoms of psychosis,"Having moments of psychosis (when people lose some contact with reality) means experiencing:
delusions – thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true
hallucinations – hearing and, in some cases, feeling, smelling, seeing or tasting things that are not there; hearing voices is a common hallucination
The delusions and hallucinations almost always reflect the person's deeply depressed mood – for example, they may become convinced they're to blame for something, or that they've committed a crime.
""Psychomotor agitation"" is also common. This means not being able to relax or sit still, and constantly fidgeting.
At the other extreme, a person with psychotic depression may have ""psychomotor retardation"", where both their thoughts and physical movements slow down.
People with psychotic depression have an increased risk of thinking about suicide."
What causes psychotic depression?,"The cause of psychotic depression is not fully understood. It's known that there's no single cause of depression and it has many different triggers.
Genes probably play a part, as severe depression can run in families.
Life events and personal circumstances can be the cause for some people. This can include bereavement, relationship problems, financial problems, health problems and recent or past traumatic experiences.
It's not known why some people with severe depression also develop psychosis.
Read more about the causes of clinical depression"
Treating psychotic depression,"Treatment for psychotic depression involves:
medicine – a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis
talking therapies – the 1-to-1 talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved effective in helping some people with severe depression, including those with psychosis
social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation
The person may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time while they're receiving treatment.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended if the person has severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, have not worked. The mental health charity Mind has more information on ECT.
Treatment is usually effective, but follow-up appointments so that the person can be closely monitored are usually required."
Getting help for others,"People with psychosis are often unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely.
As a result of this lack of insight, it's often down to the person's friends, relatives or carers to seek help for them.
If you're concerned about someone and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or mental health team if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition.
Contact the person's GP if this is the first time they've shown symptoms of psychosis.
If you think the person's symptoms are placing them or others at possible risk of harm you can:
take them to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree
call a GP or use an NHS urgent and emergency care service
call 999 to ask for an ambulance"
Further information,"The following websites provide further information and support:
SANE
Mind: psychosis"
Driving,"If you've been diagnosed with psychotic depression, it's your legal obligation to tell the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
You must not drive until you have been assessed as safe to do so.
Visit GOV.UK for more information about medical conditions, disabilities and driving"
Check if you have pubic lice,"Pubic lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour.
They can be hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair.
They most often live on pubic hair around the penis or vagina, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on the head.
Other symptoms of pubic lice include:
itching, which is usually worse at night
small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)
white/yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)
dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo)
crusted or sticky eyelashes, if they're affected"
What happens at your appointment,"If you go to a sexual health clinic or GP surgery because you think you have pubic lice, a doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice.
They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected, such as your armpits, chest or eyelashes.
To help spot any lice, they might use a comb and a magnifying lens.
If they think you might have caught the lice during sex, they may ask about your sexual partners. They may also suggest getting tested for any sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."
Treatment for pubic lice,"The main treatments for pubic lice are medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.
You usually need to use the treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You'll need to repeat this again a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.
You may be asked to come back a week after you finish treatment, to check if the treatment has worked.
Any current or recent sexual partners should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms."
How to stop pubic lice spreading,"While you're being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice spreading to others and stop the lice coming back.
Do
wash your clothes and bedding on a hot wash (50C or higher), get them dry cleaned, or put them in a plastic bag for at least a week – this will help kill any lice
vacuum your mattress to remove any lice
Don’t
do not share clothes, bedding or hygiene products (such as razors)
do not have close body contact (including sexual contact) with anyone else during treatment"
How you get pubic lice,"Pubic lice are mainly spread by close body contact, most commonly sexual contact.
The lice cannot jump or fly, but can climb from one person to another.
You can also catch the lice from clothes, bedding or towels used by someone with pubic lice, but this is rare."
How to avoid getting pubic lice,"It can be hard to prevent pubic lice.
The only way to avoid getting them is to avoid having sexual contact (or sharing bedding or clothing) with anyone you know who has pubic lice, until they've been treated.
Condoms and other forms of contraception will not protect you from pubic lice. But it's still a good idea to use condoms during sex because they reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."
Check if you have pudendal neuralgia,"The main symptom of pudendal neuralgia is sharp, shooting, burning or tingling pain (nerve pain) or numbness in your:
genitals (your vagina, vulva and clitoris or penis and scrotum)
bottom and anus
perineum (the area between your genitals and anus)
pelvis
The pain may be worse when sitting down and may get worse throughout the day.
Other symptoms can include:
needing to pee more often
pain when peeing or pooing
constipation
a feeling of swelling or fullness in your anus or vagina
difficulty getting an erection
difficulty reaching orgasm
pain when having sex"
How pudendal neuralgia is diagnosed,"Pudendal neuralgia can be hard to diagnose because it's rare and the symptoms are similar to other conditions.
It's usually diagnosed based on your symptoms and by ruling out other causes.
A GP may refer you for tests to look for what's causing your pain. Tests you may have include:
a vaginal or rectal examination – a doctor will use their finger to feel for any problems inside your vagina or rectum (bottom)
scans such as an MRI scan, CT scan or ultrasound scan
a test called electromyography (EMG), where electrical signals sent from small sensors are used to check how your nerves work
injections to numb one of the nerves in your pelvis"
Treatments for pudendal neuralgia,"Pudendal neuralgia can be hard to treat. The treatment will depend on how severe your pain is and what's causing it.
A GP may recommend treatments such as:
physiotherapy, including advice on exercises
medicines that can help with nerve pain, such as amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin
a strong painkiller called tramadol, if other pain relief does not work and you need pain relief for a short time while you're waiting to see a specialist
If you have severe pain or it's affecting your daily activities, the GP may refer you to a specialist in nerve conditions (neurologist) or a specialist pain clinic.
Treatment from a specialist may include:
injections to reduce pain
surgery, if something is putting pressure on a nerve and other treatments have not worked
psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy to help you cope with pain"
Things you can do to help pudendal neuralgia,"If you have pudendal neuralgia there are things you can do to help with the symptoms.
A specialist may be able to suggest lifestyle changes that can help.
Do
eat plenty of fibre and drink lots of water to help prevent constipation or pain when pooing
if you want to keep riding a bike, try using a different type of saddle to see if it helps your pain
Don’t
do not sit for long periods – get up regularly and move around
do not wear tight underwear or trousers
do not do activities that make your pain worse such as activities that involve a lot of squatting, bending or lifting"
Causes of pudendal neuralgia,"Pudendal neuralgia is caused by damage to the pudendal nerve, which is one of the main nerves in your pelvis.
Possible causes include:
an injury
damage from surgery
giving birth
activities that put pressure on the nerve such as cycling, horse riding or sitting for a long time
a growth or tumour that puts pressure on the nerve
infections such as genital herpes
Sometimes it's not clear what causes it."
Help and support for pudendal neuralgia,"If you have pudendal neuralgia you can get support from charities including:
the Pelvic Pain Support Network
Action on Pain"
Check if you have a pulmonary embolism,"Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include:
difficulty breathing that comes on suddenly
chest pain that's worse when you breathe in
coughing up blood
You may also have pain, redness and swelling in one of your legs (usually the calf). These are symptoms of a blood clot, also called DVT (deep vein thrombosis)."
Treating a pulmonary embolism,"If a GP thinks you've got a pulmonary embolism, you'll be sent to hospital for further tests and treatment.
At hospital, you'll probably be given an injection of anticoagulant medicine before you get any test results.
Anticoagulants stop blood clots getting bigger and prevent new clots forming.
If tests confirm you have a pulmonary embolism, you'll continue with anticoagulant injections for at least 5 days.
You'll also need to take anticoagulant tablets for at least 3 months.
You should make a full recovery from a pulmonary embolism if it's spotted and treated early."
Reduce your pulmonary embolism risk,"A pulmonary embolism often happens when part of the blood clot dislodges itself from your leg and travels up to your lungs, causing a blockage.
There are measures you can take to lower your risk of getting a pulmonary embolism.
If you're being treated in hospital for another condition, your medical team should take steps to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis).
A DVT can occasionally develop on long journeys such as bus, train or air travel. The risk of developing DVT is increased for flights lasting more than 4 hours.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting a travel-related DVT.
Do
sit comfortably in your seat and choose an aisle seat if possible
wear loose-fitting clothing
make sure you have plenty of leg room
drink water regularly
take regular breaks from sitting
bend and straighten your legs, feet and toes every 30 minutes while seated
press the balls of your feet down hard against the floor every so often
wear flight socks
Don’t
do not sit for long periods without moving
do not drink alcohol
do not drink too much coffee and other caffeine-based drinks
do not take sleeping pills"
Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension,"Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:
shortness of breath
tiredness
feeling faint or dizzy
chest pain (angina)
a racing heartbeat (palpitations)
swelling (oedema) in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy (abdomen)
The symptoms often get worse during exercise, which can limit your ability to take part in physical activities.
If you have a type of pulmonary hypertension known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), you may not have any symptoms until the condition is quite advanced."
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you have any symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. They may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and they may carry out a physical examination.
Call 999 or go to A&E if you get sudden chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes, or you have heart palpitations with chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. These could be a sign of another condition such as a blood clot in your lungs or a serious heart problem.
Correctly diagnosing pulmonary hypertension can sometimes take time because its symptoms are similar to those of many other heart and lung conditions.
Tests you may have include a type of heart scan called an echocardiogram, and right heart catheterisation, where a thin, flexible tube is inserted into your pulmonary artery.
Read more about how pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed."
Causes of pulmonary hypertension,"The changes in the pulmonary arteries that lead to pulmonary hypertension can be caused by:
various conditions that cause problems with the smaller branches of the pulmonary arteries (PAH)
conditions that affect the left side of the heart
lung diseases or a shortage of oxygen in the body (hypoxia)
blood clots that cause narrowing or a blockage in the pulmonary arteries
Read more about the causes of pulmonary hypertension."
Treating pulmonary hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension cannot be cured, but treatment can reduce the symptoms and help you manage your condition. 
Pulmonary hypertension usually gets worse over time. Left untreated, it may cause heart failure, which can be fatal, so it's important treatment is started as soon as possible.
If another condition is causing pulmonary hypertension, the underlying condition should be treated first. This can sometimes prevent the pulmonary arteries being permanently damaged.
Treatments for pulmonary hypertension may include anticoagulant medicines to reduce the blood's ability to thicken (clot) and diuretics to remove excess fluid as a result of heart failure.
You may also be offered medicine to widen the blood vessels.
Home oxygen therapy may also be prescribed if the level of oxygen in your blood is low.
Read more about treating pulmonary hypertension."
Outlook,"The outlook for pulmonary hypertension varies, depending on factors such as:
what's causing it
how quickly it's diagnosed
how advanced your symptoms are
whether you have another underlying health condition
The specialist in charge of your care will be able to give you more detailed information.
Having pulmonary hypertension can affect your ability to carry out everyday activities.
The charity Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK offers practical information and support for people living with pulmonary hypertension and their friends and families."
Symptoms of pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum often appears suddenly as either a small spot, red bump or blood blister.
This then turns into a painful ulcer. It may have purple or blue edges and ooze fluid. The ulcer can grow quickly. Usually there is only 1 ulcer, but you might get several in the area.
Credit:
If the ulcer gets infected, you may notice pus coming from it. You may also feel generally unwell and get a high temperature.
Pyoderma gangrenosum usually occurs on the legs, although it can affect any area of skin. It sometimes develops around an injury or surgical wound."
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP as soon as possible if you have an ulcer on your skin that is not getting better.
It's a serious condition that can progress quickly, so it's important to get it diagnosed and treated quickly.
Early treatment can also help reduce the risk of scarring."
Causes of pyoderma gangrenosum,"The cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is often not known. It may be related to overactivity of the immune system.
Sometimes it may be caused by an injury or minor skin damage such as a needle prick, a biopsy or an insect bite.
It can also be linked to a disease or illness.
But, in about half of the people who get pyoderma gangrenosum, there's no obvious reason for it.
Pyoderma gangrenosum is not passed down to children from their parents through genes. It's also not contagious so cannot be transferred from or to another person."
People more likely to get pyoderma gangrenosum,"People with the following health conditions are more likely to develop pyoderma gangrenosum:
ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease
rheumatoid arthritis – a long-term condition causing pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints
blood dyscrasia – a blood disorder
hepatitis C – inflammation of the liver
granulomatosis with polyangiitis – a rare condition in which the walls of blood vessels become inflamed
cancer affecting the blood cells – including acute myeloid leukaemia
PAPA syndrome – a rare genetic disorder"
Diagnosing pyoderma gangrenosum,"There's no specific blood test for pyoderma gangrenosum.
If a doctor thinks you might have it, they may ask for some tests, including:
taking a small sample of your skin (biopsy) to help rule out other causes of skin ulcers
taking a swab of the wound to check for any infection
blood tests to check for conditions associated with pyoderma gangrenosum"
Treating pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum can be difficult to treat. Treatment can leave some scarring in the affected area.
Some people heal very slowly, over months or years. Others may find the condition clears up within a few weeks. In some cases, it returns after treatment.
There are a number of treatment options, and there's no clear evidence to suggest which is the best one. You may need to try different treatments.
Care of the wound
Regular dressings may need to be applied to soak up any discharge and help retain the creams applied to the wound. Any severely damaged tissue should be gently removed by a doctor or nurse.
Creams, ointments or injections
Strong steroid creams or ointments are applied on and around ulcers regularly. They can help the ulcers heal quickly, particularly if the ulcers are small and diagnosed early.
Alternatively, a steroid called triamcinolone may be injected into the edge of the ulcer.
Tacrolimus ointment has also proved useful in treating pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers.
Steroid tablets
Most people with pyoderma gangrenosum need to take steroid tablets, either on their own or with antibiotics. These reduce inflammation and help the ulcers to heal.
However, the long-term use of steroids is associated with serious side effects such as bone thinning (osteoporosis), so they need to be used with caution.
Read more about the side effects of steroid tablets.
Immunosuppressants
Pyoderma gangrenosum is thought to be caused by an overactive immune system. Immunosuppressants reduce the effect of the immune system.
They can reduce pain and help the ulcers to heal.
However, immunosuppressants can have unpleasant side effects, and need to be given and monitored by a specialist.
Only take immunosuppressants if they're prescribed to you by a doctor."
Symptoms of Q fever,"Q fever does not always cause symptoms. Some people get flu-like symptoms within 2 to 3 weeks of being infected, such as:
a high temperature
aching muscles
tiredness
feeling sick
a sore throat
swollen glands
Symptoms of Q fever usually last up to 2 weeks."
How Q fever is spread,"Q fever is most often spread to humans by close contact with infected farm animals.
The bacteria can be spread by contact with:
afterbirth (placenta)
blood
pee
poo
animal skins, fur and wool
The bacteria can spread by being breathed in or through touch.
You can also get Q fever from drinking unpasteurised milk (milk that has not been heated to kill bacteria), but this is less likely.
Although Q fever is rare, people who work closely with animals are more at risk, such as farmers, vets, stablehands and abattoir workers."
Treatment from a GP,"If a GP thinks you might have Q fever, they can arrange a blood test to see if you have been infected.
If you're pregnant and you test positive for Q fever, a GP can refer you for more tests to see if your baby has been infected. This is very rare.
If your symptoms are severe or they're not getting better, a GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics for 1 or 2 weeks.
It's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better."
How to prevent Q fever,"There is currently no licensed vaccine for Q fever available in the UK.
If you work with animals:
Do
wash your hands regularly
clean cuts or grazes immediately and cover them with a plaster or dressing
wear protective clothing, such as waterproof gloves and goggles
ensure all animal afterbirth (placenta) is cleaned up safely
Don’t
do not help animals give birth if you're pregnant
do not touch anything that has been near animal blood, poo, pee or afterbirth, such as clothes, boots or gloves
do not drink milk that has not been heated to kill bacteria (unpasteurised milk)
do not eat in areas where animals are kept
Important
If you're pregnant, it's especially important to avoid contact with sheep and lambs during the lambing season, between January and April.
Do not touch anything that has been near sheep or lambs, such as gloves or boots.
If you catch Q fever while pregnant, you will usually have no symptoms, so it's better to avoid any risk.
There is also a risk of catching toxoplasmosis from sheep and lambs during lambing season."
Chronic Q fever,"In a few people with Q fever, the symptoms can last for months. This is known as chronic Q fever.
Chronic Q fever sometimes leads to serious heart problems, such as endocarditis.
People with chronic Q fever may need a much longer course of antibiotics and treatment in hospital for any complications that develop."
Check if you have tonsillitis,"Tonsillitis can feel like a bad cold or flu. The tonsils at the back of your throat will be red and swollen.
The main symptoms in children and adults are:
a sore throat
problems swallowing
a high temperature of 38C or above
coughing
a headache
feeling sick
earache
feeling tired
Sometimes the symptoms can be more severe and include:
swollen, painful glands in your neck (feels like a lump on the side of your neck)
pus-filled spots or white patches on your tonsils
bad breath"
How long tonsillitis lasts,"Symptoms will usually go away after 3 to 4 days.
Tonsillitis is not contagious, but most of the infections that cause it are, for example, colds and flu.
To stop these infections spreading:
if you or your child have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better
use tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw them away
wash your hands after coughing or sneezing"
How to treat tonsillitis yourself,"Tonsillitis usually gets better on its own after a few days.
To help treat the symptoms:
get plenty of rest
drink cool drinks to soothe the throat
take paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16)
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)"
A pharmacist can help with tonsillitis,"Speak to a pharmacist about tonsillitis.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, like:
lozenges
throat sprays
antiseptic solutions
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment from a GP,"Treatment will depend on what caused your tonsillitis:
most children and adults get viral tonsillitis (caused by a virus), which clears up on its own
for bacterial tonsillitis (caused by bacteria), a GP may prescribe antibiotics
A GP will usually wait for the test results to tell which type you have.
Important:
Surgery to remove your tonsils
It's very rare that someone needs to have their tonsils taken out.
This is usually only the case if you have severe tonsillitis that keeps coming back."
Causes of tonsillitis,"Tonsillitis is usually caused by a virus, such as a cold, but it can also be due to a bacterial infection such as strep throat."
Complications with tonsillitis (quinsy),"Complications with tonsillitis are very rare.
Sometimes you can get a pocket filled with pus (abscess) between your tonsils and the wall of your throat. This is called quinsy.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you have a severe sore throat that quickly gets worse
you have swelling inside the mouth and throat
you have difficulty speaking
you cannot swallow
you have difficulty breathing
you have difficulty opening your mouth
These are signs of quinsy."
Check if you're at risk of rabies,"Rabies is found throughout the world, but it's very rare in the UK.
Although the risk of getting it while travelling is small, rabies is more common in parts of:
Asia
Africa
Central and South America
Rabies is spread by mammals, such as dogs, bats, raccoons and foxes. In the UK, it's only found in some bats.
You can get rabies if:
you're bitten or scratched by an infected animal
an infected animal licks your eyes, nose or mouth, or you have a wound that's licked by an infected animal"
How to reduce your risk of rabies,"If you're travelling abroad, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk of getting rabies.
Do
get advice from a travel health clinic at least 8 weeks before you travel – they may recommend getting vaccinated against rabies
find out where you'll be able to get urgent medical help while abroad
wash any animal bites or scratches with soap and water and get medical help immediately
Don’t
do not touch or go near wild or stray animals, even if they do not seem unwell (animals with rabies may not have any symptoms)
do not feed any animals, including in zoos or animal sanctuaries
Rabies vaccination
The rabies vaccine is recommended if you're travelling to a part of the world where rabies is more common, especially if:
you're going somewhere where it may be hard to get medical help quickly
you might come into contact with infected animals (for example, you'll be doing lots of outdoor activities like cycling or running)
you're staying for over a month
Some people at risk of rabies through their work should also get vaccinated.
You have to pay for the rabies vaccine for travel. You can get it from travel health clinics and pharmacies with travel health services."
Treatment for possible rabies,"If you've been bitten, scratched or licked by an animal that may have rabies, a doctor will check if you need treatment.
Treatment usually involves:
2 or more doses of the rabies vaccine
a medicine called rabies immunoglobulin, a liquid given into the wound or by injection (this is only needed if you've not had the rabies vaccine before or have a weakened immune system)
If treated quickly, treatment is usually very effective at preventing rabies. Rabies cannot be treated if symptoms appear.
Information:
If you had treatment while abroad, contact your GP when you get back to the UK. They can check if you need any more treatment."
Symptoms of rabies,"Symptoms of rabies usually take 3 to 12 weeks to appear, but they can appear after a few days or not for several months or years.
Symptoms include:
numbness or tingling where you were bitten or scratched
seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)
feeling very anxious or energetic
difficulty swallowing or breathing
being unable to move (paralysis)
Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal."
When radiotherapy is used,"Radiotherapy may be used in the early stages of cancer or after it has started to spread.
It can be used to:
try to cure the cancer completely (curative radiotherapy)
make other treatments more effective – for example, it can be combined with chemotherapy or used before surgery (neo-adjuvant radiotherapy)
reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery (adjuvant radiotherapy)
relieve symptoms if a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)"
Types of radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy can be given in several ways. Your doctors will recommend the best type for you.
The most common types are:
external radiotherapy, where a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the cancer
radiotherapy implants (brachytherapy), where small pieces of radioactive metal are (usually temporarily) placed inside your body near the cancer
radiotherapy injections, capsules or drinks (radioisotope therapy), where you swallow a radioactive liquid, or have it injected into your blood
intrabeam radiotherapy, where radiation is delivered directly at the tumour during breast cancer surgery (this treatment is not available at all NHS hospitals)
Radiotherapy is usually given in hospital. You can usually go home soon after external radiotherapy, but you may need to stay in hospital for a few days if you have implants or radioisotope therapy.
Read more about what happens during radiotherapy."
Side effects of radiotherapy,"As well as killing cancer cells, radiotherapy can damage some healthy cells in the area being treated.
This can cause some side effects, such as:
sore skin that might change colour to red, lighter or darker than your usual skin tone
feeling tired
hair loss in the area being treated
feeling sick
losing your appetite
a sore mouth
diarrhoea
Many of these side effects can be treated or prevented and most will go away after treatment stops.
External radiotherapy does not make you radioactive, as the radiation passes through your body.
The radiation from implants or injections can stay in your body for a few days, so you may need to stay in hospital and avoid close contact with other people for a few days as a precaution.
You may need to avoid close contact with children and pregnant women when you go home for a short time. Your care team will let you know what to do.
Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy."

Check if it's Raynaud's,"Raynaud's affects your blood circulation. When you're cold, anxious or stressed, your fingers and toes may change colour.
Other symptoms can include:
pain
numbness
pins and needles
The skin may turn white or a lighter colour as blood flow is restricted.
Credit:
Sometimes the skin turns blue as blood vessels react.
Credit:
The skin may turn red as blood flow returns.
Credit:
Raynaud's may make your fingertips appear paler if you have brown or black skin.
Credit:
Some people also find that their ears, nose, lips or nipples are affected.
The symptoms of Raynaud's may last from a few minutes to a few hours.
Raynaud's is sometimes caused by another health condition, taking certain medicines, or working with vibrating tools for a long time."
Things you can do to help with Raynaud's,"If you have Raynaud's:
Do
keep your home warm
wear warm clothes during cold weather, especially on your hands and feet
try to avoid sudden changes in temperature
exercise regularly – this helps improve circulation
try breathing exercises or yoga to help you relax
eat a healthy, balanced diet
Don’t
do not smoke – improve your circulation by quitting smoking
do not have too much caffeine (found in tea, coffee, cola and chocolate) – it may trigger the symptoms of Raynaud's"
Treatment for Raynaud's from a GP,"If you have Raynaud's and your symptoms are very bad or getting worse, a GP may prescribe a medicine to help improve your circulation. For example, you may be offered nifedipine, which is used to treat high blood pressure.
Some people need to take this medicine every day. Others only use it to prevent Raynaud's, for example, during cold weather.
A GP may arrange tests if they think Raynaud's could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus."
Symptoms of reactive arthritis,"The most common symptom of reactive arthritis is pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints and tendons, most commonly the knees, feet, toes, hips and ankles.
In some people it can also affect the:
genital tract – causing pain when peeing, or discharge from the penis or vagina
eyes – causing eye pain, redness, sticky discharge, conjunctivitis and, rarely, inflammation of the eye (iritis).
See an eye specialist or go to A&E as soon as possible if one of your eyes becomes very painful and the vision becomes misty.
This could be a symptom of iritis – and the sooner you get treatment, the more successful it is likely to be.
Most people will not get all the above symptoms. They can come on suddenly but usually start to develop a few days after you get an infection somewhere else in your body.
Read more about the symptoms of reactive arthritis."
Causes of reactive arthritis,"Typically, reactive arthritis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel, such as food poisoning.
You may also develop reactive arthritis if you, or someone close to you, has recently had glandular fever or slapped cheek syndrome.
The body's immune system seems to overreact to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed. But the exact reason for this is unknown.
People who have a gene called HLA-B27 are much more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don't, but it's unclear why."
When to see your GP,"If you have symptoms of reactive arthritis, you should see your GP, especially if you have recently had symptoms of an infection – such as diarrhoea, or pain when peeing.
There's no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs, ultrasound scans and X-rays may be used to check for infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms.
Your GP will also want to know about your recent medical history, such as whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an STI.
If you think you might have an STI, you can also visit a sexual health clinic or other sexual health service. These clinics can often see you straight away, without a GP referral.
Find sexual health services in your area.
If your GP thinks you have reactive arthritis, they may refer you to an arthritis specialist (rheumatologist). They may also refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) if you have problems with your eyes."
Treatment for reactive arthritis,"Treatment usually focuses on:
using antibiotics to clear any STI that may have triggered the reactive arthritis
using painkillers such as ibuprofen to relieve joint pain and stiffness
managing any severe or ongoing arthritis, usually using medications such as steroids or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
Read more about treatment for reactive arthritis.
Most people start returning to normal activities after 3 to 6 months. Symptoms don't usually last longer than 12 months."
When a rectal examination may be needed,"A rectal examination is sometimes needed to investigate:
bleeding from the bottom
pain in the bottom
constipation
being unable to control when you go to the toilet (incontinence) – including bowel incontinence or urinary incontinence
Men sometimes need a rectal examination to check for problems with the prostate.
What is the prostate?"
Before having a rectal examination,"Your doctor or nurse should explain what's going to happen and why you need a rectal examination.
They'll know that some people can feel embarrassed, but it's a common procedure.
Let the doctor or nurse know if:
you'd prefer a man or woman to perform the examination
you'd like someone else in the room – it could be a friend, family member or another doctor or nurse
you have severe pain in your bottom – they may be able to use local anaesthetic to numb the area"
What happens during a rectal examination,"First, you'll be asked to undress from the waist down. If you're wearing a loose skirt, you can usually just remove your underwear.
Let the doctor or nurse know if you'd like to get changed behind a curtain or be alone in the room.
The doctor or nurse will:
Ask you to lie down on your left side, with your knees lifted up towards your chest. This is the easiest position to examine your rectum.
Put on some gloves and look at the outside of your bottom for any problems.
Put some lubricating gel on 1 finger and gently slide it into your rectum. This should not be painful, but may be a little bit uncomfortable.
Sometimes ask you to squeeze around their finger so they can assess how well the muscles are working.
If you're a man, the doctor or nurse may press on your prostate. This can make you feel the urge to pee, but it should not hurt.
Once you're dressed, they'll discuss the results of the examination with you."
Common causes of a red eye,"Lots of different things can cause a red eye.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing it.
Common causes of red eyes and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Bright red area in the white of your eye Burst blood vessel
Gritty or burning feeling, sticky eyes Conjunctivitis
Sore, blurry or watery eyes Dry eyes
Itchy, sore or red eyelids Blepharitis
Feels like there's something in your eye Ingrowing eyelash
Swollen, drooping or twitching eyelid, or a lump on your eyelid Eyelid problems"
What to do if you have a red eye,"If your eye does not hurt and your sight is not affected, it's probably nothing serious. It may get better on its own in a few days.
Until it has got better:
try not to touch or rub your eye
do not wear contact lenses

Check if it's repetitive strain injury (RSI),"You can get repetitive strain injury (RSI) in many parts of the body, but it most often affects the:
shoulders
elbows
forearms and wrists
hands and fingers
The symptoms usually start gradually and can include:
pain, which may feel like burning, aching or throbbing
stiffness and weakness
tingling, pins-and-needles or numbness
muscle cramps
swelling"
Causes of repetitive strain injury (RSI),"Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is caused by repeated use of a body part, such as your shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist or hand.
For example, you can get RSI if:
you do repetitive activities like hairdressing, decorating, typing or working on an assembly line
you play sports like golf or tennis that involve lots of repetitive movements
you have poor posture when sitting or standing at work
you use hand-held power tools regularly
Repetitive or strenuous work does not always cause RSI. Many people do the same job for years without having a problem.
Pain in a part of the body like the arm is often caused by a combination of things, including aging."
Things you can do to help ease repetitive strain injury (RSI),"There are a number of things you can do to help ease the symptoms of repetitive strain injury (RSI).
Do
keep active – you may need to limit the amount of activity you do to start with before gradually increasing it
take paracetamol or anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen – you can get tablets or gels that you rub on the painful area
try using a hot or cold pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on the affected area for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
speak to your employer about ways they can help you continue working, like changing the way you work or reducing your hours
Don’t
do not rest the affected area for more than a few days – resting for too long can lead to the affected body part becoming weaker and less flexible
A pharmacist can help with RSI
You can ask a pharmacist:
about painkilling tablets and gels
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for repetitive strain injury (RSI),"Most people with repetitive strain injury (RSI) are able to manage their symptoms and get better without further treatment.
Physiotherapy
If your symptoms do not improve, you may be referred for physiotherapy.
As well as massaging the affected area, a physiotherapist can show you exercises to help strengthen your muscles and improve your posture.
Physiotherapy is free on the NHS throughout the UK but waiting times can be long. You can also pay to see a physiotherapist privately.
Find a physiotherapist
Other treatments
Sometimes steroid injections may be recommended to help reduce pain and swelling.
Rarely, surgery may be needed if RSI is very severe."
Check if you have an RTI,"Symptoms of an RTI include:
a cough – you may bring up mucus (phlegm)
sneezing
a stuffy or runny nose
a sore throat
headaches
muscle aches
breathlessness, tight chest or wheezing
a high temperature
feeling generally unwell"
Things you can do yourself,Most RTIs pass within 1 to 2 weeks. You can usually treat your symptoms at home.
A pharmacist can help with an RTI,"A pharmacist can suggest treatments to help relieve your symptoms, such as decongestants and nasal sprays.
You can also buy cough medicines and throat lozenges, although there's little evidence to show they help.
Some treatments contain paracetamol and ibuprofen.
If you're taking these medicines separately, be careful not to take more than the recommended dose.
Certain treatments are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women. Your pharmacist can advise you about the best treatment for you or your child."
Treatment from a GP,"Treatment will depend on the cause of your RTI:
a virus (like colds) – this usually clears up by itself after a few weeks and antibiotics will not help
bacteria (like pneumonia) – a GP may prescribe antibiotics (make sure you complete the whole course as advised by a GP, even if you start to feel better)
Sometimes a sample of your mucus may need to be tested to see what's causing your RTI."
How to avoid passing RTIs on to others:,"cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze
wash your hands regularly
throw away used tissues immediately
How to avoid getting an RTI
If you keep getting RTIs or you're at a high risk of getting one (for example, because you're over the age of 65 or have a serious long-term health condition), you should:
ask a GP about the annual flu vaccination – find out if you're eligible for the free flu vaccine
ask if you should have the pneumococcal vaccine – this helps prevent pneumonia
stop smoking if you smoke
drink less alcohol
Causes and types of RTIs
RTIs are often spread in the coughs and sneezes of someone with an infection.
There are several different types. They're usually grouped into upper and lower RTIs.
Difference between upper RTIs and lower RTIs
Upper RTIs (sinuses and throat) Lower RTIs (airways and lungs)
Common cold Bronchitis
Sinusitis (sinus infection) Bronchiolitis
Tonsillitis Chest infection
Laryngitis Pneumonia (lung infection)
Flu can be an upper or lower RTI.
Lower RTIs tend to last longer and can be more serious."
Symptoms of restless legs syndrome,"The main symptom of restless legs syndrome is an overwhelming urge to move your legs.
It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs.
The sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected, too.
Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements (PLM).
Some people have the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day.
The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities."
What causes restless legs syndrome?,"In the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome.
This is known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families.
Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine.
Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome.
In some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition, such as iron deficiency anaemia or kidney failure. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.
There's also a link between restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in 5 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last 3 months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is.
In such cases, restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth.
Find out more about the causes of restless legs syndrome"
Treating restless legs syndrome,"Mild cases of restless legs syndrome that are not linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes.
These include:
tips for how to get to sleep (for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night)
quitting smoking if you smoke
exercising regularly during the daytime
If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron in your body.
If restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms."
Who's affected by restless legs syndrome?,"Restless legs syndrome is a common condition that can affect anyone at any point in their life.
But women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome as men.
It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood."
Outlook,"The symptoms of restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it's possible to address an underlying cause. 
But if the cause is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person's life.
Restless legs syndrome is not life threatening, but severe cases can disrupt sleep (causing insomnia) and trigger anxiety and depression.
The charity Restless Leg Syndrome UK (RLS-UK) provides information and support for people affected by restless legs syndrome."
Check if it's a retinal migraine,"Retinal migraines usually affect 1 eye.
They often come on suddenly and symptoms include:
vision loss – this usually lasts around 10 to 20 minutes but can sometimes last up to 1 hour
a blind spot in your vision
a headache – you may get this at the same time as the eye symptoms or shortly afterwards
other eye symptoms, such as blurred vision and seeing flashing lights, zigzag patterns or coloured spots or lines
feeling sick or being sick
Sometimes you can get the eye symptoms without having a headache."
Treatments for retinal migraine,"Treatment for retinal migraines is not usually needed if you do not have them very often.
If you have them frequently, a GP may suggest:
trying to avoid things that cause your migraines, such as cutting down on caffeine or alcohol
painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen
medicines to stop you feeling sick or being sick
medicines to help prevent migraines, such as topiramate or amitriptyline
a few weeks of acupuncture
If these treatments do not help control your migraines, you may be referred to a specialist called a neurologist for more tests and treatment."
Causes of retinal migraine,"Retinal migraines are thought to happen when the blood vessels in your eye suddenly narrow, restricting the blood flow.
Things that can cause them include:
stress
caffeine and alcohol
dehydration
smoking
high blood pressure
bending over
low blood sugar
some types of hormonal contraception
Keeping a record of when you get migraines in a diary can help you work out what might be causing them."
Things you can do if you get retinal migraines,"There are things you can do if you get retinal migraines. A GP may suggest trying them before recommending other treatments.
Do
try sleeping or lying down in a dark room during a migraine
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration
have a healthy diet and eat meals at regular times
exercise regularly and get plenty of sleep
try to keep to a healthy weight
try to manage your stress levels
avoid things you know can trigger migraines like caffeine and alcohol"
Signs and symptoms,"Some children with Rett syndrome are affected more severely than others. Also, the age at which symptoms first appear varies from child to child.
A child may not have all the symptoms of Rett syndrome, and their symptoms might change as they get older.
Rett syndrome is described in 4 stages, although symptoms will often overlap between each stage. These are the main features of each stage:
Stage 1: early signs
At first, the child will appear to develop and grow normally for at least 6 months. There may be subtle signs of Rett syndrome before the child is recognised as having a problem (especially with hindsight).
Stage 1 is sometimes described as ""stagnation"". Symptoms include:
low muscle tone (hypotonia)
difficulty feeding
unusual, repetitive hand movements or jerky limb movements
delay with development of speech
mobility problems, such as problems sitting, crawling and walking
lack of interest in toys
These symptoms typically begin from 6 to 18 months and often last for several months, although they can persist for a year or more.
Stage 1 can often go unnoticed because the changes occur gradually and may be subtle.
Stage 2: regression
During stage 2, known as ""regression"" or the ""rapid destructive stage"", the child starts to lose some of their abilities. This stage usually begins between the ages of 1 and 4 and may last for any time from 2 months to more than 2 years.
The child will gradually or suddenly start to develop severe problems with communication and language, memory, mobility, co-ordination and other brain functions. Some of the characteristics and behaviours are similar to those of autism.
Signs at this stage include:
loss of the ability to use the hands purposefully – repetitive hand movements are often difficult to control and include wringing, washing, clapping or tapping
periods of distress, irritability and sometimes screaming for no obvious reason
social withdrawal – a loss of interest in people and avoidance of eye contact
unsteadiness and awkwardness when walking
problems sleeping
slowing of head growth
difficulty eating, chewing or swallowing, and sometimes constipation that may cause stomach aches
problems with heart rate or heart rhythm
Later on during regression, the child may experience periods of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) or slow breathing, including breath-holding. They may also swallow air which can lead to abdominal bloating.
Stage 3: plateau
Stage 3 of Rett syndrome can begin as early as 2 years or as late as 10 years. It often lasts for many years, with many children remaining in this stage for most of their lives.
During stage 3, some of the stage 2 symptoms may get better – for example, there may be improvements in behaviour, with less irritability and crying.
The child may become more interested in people and their surroundings, and there may be improvements in alertness, attention span and communication. Their walking may also improve (or they may learn to walk, if they could not before).
Other symptoms at this stage include:
seizures
irregular breathing patterns may get worse – for example, shallow breathing followed by rapid, deep breathing, or breath-holding
Gaining and maintaining weight can also be difficult to achieve.
Stage 4: deterioration in movement
Stage 4 can last for years or even decades. The main symptoms at this stage are:
development of a spinal curve (the spine bending to the left or right side), known as scoliosis. This is more likely from the age of 6 years, and the risk reduces after puberty
muscle weakness and spasticity (abnormal stiffness, particularly in the legs)
losing the ability to walk
Communication, language skills and brain function do not tend to get any worse during stage 4. The repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves.
Seizures also usually become less of a problem during teenage and early adult life, although they will often be a lifelong problem to manage."
What causes Rett syndrome?,"Almost all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation (a change in the DNA) in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes).
The MECP2 gene contains instructions for producing a particular protein (MeCP2), which is needed for brain development. The gene abnormality prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly.
There's usually no family history of Rett syndrome, which means it's not passed on from one generation to the next. Almost all cases (over 99%) are spontaneous, with the mutation occurring randomly."
Diagnosing Rett syndrome,"Rett syndrome is usually diagnosed based on your child's symptoms, and by ruling out other more common disorders.
A diagnosis of Rett syndrome may not be made straight away because the syndrome is so rare, and symptoms do not tend to appear until a child is between 6 and 18 months old.
A genetic blood test can be used to identify if the genetic mutation is responsible for Rett syndrome. If a change is found in the MECP2 gene, it can help confirm the diagnosis, but failing to find it does not necessarily rule out the syndrome.
Read more about genetic testing."
Managing Rett syndrome,"There's no cure for Rett syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.
As a parent caring for a child with the syndrome, it's likely you'll need help and support from a wide range of healthcare professionals.
Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids:
speech and language therapy, picture boards, eye gaze technology and other visual aids to help with communication, or ways to help them communicate such as Signalong, Makaton or PECS
medicine for breathing and mobility problems, and anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures
physiotherapy, attention to mobility, careful attention to your child's sitting posture (to minimise the chances of scoliosis developing), and frequent changes in posture
if scoliosis does become established, a back brace and sometimes spinal surgery may be used to prevent the spine curving further (read more about treating scoliosis)
a high-calorie, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet to help maintain sufficient weight and help control seizures, with the use of a feeding tube and other feeding aids if necessary
occupational therapy to help develop the skills needed for dressing, feeding and other daily activities
an ankle-foot orthosis (lower leg brace) to help them walk independently
a hand splint to help control severe hand movements (they're mainly used for limited periods to prevent self-injury or to encourage activities with the other hand)
Therapeutic horse riding, swimming, hydrotherapy and music therapy have also been reported to be beneficial. Ask your healthcare team where you can access these therapies.
From the age of 14, people with Rett syndrome should have checks with their GP at least once a year.
Read more about caring for a disabled child and care equipment, aids and adaptations."
Outlook,"Although some people with Rett syndrome may retain a degree of hand control, walking ability and communication skills, most will be dependent on 24-hour care throughout their lives.
Many people with Rett syndrome reach adulthood, and those who are less severely affected can live into old age. However, some people die at a fairly young age as a result of complications, such as heart rhythm abnormalities, pneumonia and epilepsy."
Advice for carers,"Caring for a child with Rett syndrome is mentally and physically challenging. Most carers will need social and psychological support.
The social care and support guide provides lots of information and advice about how you can take time to look after yourself, including:
getting a break from caring
benefits for carers
Rett UK is a charity providing help and support for people living with Rett syndrome. Their helpline number is 01582 798911, and you can also contact them by email: support@rettuk.org

Check if it's Reye's syndrome,"Symptoms of Reye's syndrome often start 1 to 3 weeks after a child recovers from a virus like flu or chickenpox.
The child may:
keep being sick (vomiting)
be drowsy and lack energy
feel confused
have changes in their behaviour, such as being irritable or aggressive
breathe quickly and have a fast heart rate
have fits (seizures)
lose consciousness
Reye's syndrome most commonly affects children between 5 and 14 years of age.
Younger and older children can also sometimes get it, but it's very rare in babies under the age of 1 and in those over the age of 18."
What happens at your appointment,"If there's a chance your child might have Reye's syndrome, they'll be referred to a specialist for some tests.
Tests may include:
blood and urine tests
a CT scan and an electroencephalogram (EEG)
a lumbar puncture – where a thin needle is inserted into their lower back to remove a small amount of spinal fluid for testing
a liver biopsy – where a small sample of cells from the liver is taken for testing"
Treatments for Reye's syndrome,"If your child has Reye's syndrome, they'll need to go into hospital straight away for treatment.
Treatments for Reye's syndrome may include:
help with breathing using an oxygen machine
fluids given directly into a vein to help prevent dehydration
medicines to help treat and manage symptoms
Most children with Reye's syndrome make a full recovery if it's treated quickly. But some children can have long-term brain problems."
Causes of Reye's syndrome,"The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is unknown.
It's been linked to the use of a type of medicine known as salicylates, particularly aspirin, in young people and children under 16.
Sometimes a child with a rare genetic condition, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), can get Reye's syndrome. This has nothing to do with the use of aspirin."
Preventing Reye's syndrome,"There are things you can do to reduce your child's chance of getting Reye's syndrome.
Do
think about getting your child vaccinated against flu and other common viruses
Don’t
do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16, unless their doctor prescribes it
do not give children under 16 any medicines that contain salicylic acid or salicylate, which includes some mouth ulcer gels – ask a pharmacist for advice about alternatives suitable for children"
What causes rhesus disease?,"Rhesus disease only happens when the mother has rhesus negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus positive blood (RhD positive). The mother must have also been previously sensitised to RhD positive blood.
Sensitisation happens when a woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an RhD positive baby. The woman’s body responds to the RhD positive blood by producing antibodies (infection-fighting molecules) that recognise the foreign blood cells and destroy them.
If sensitisation occurs, the next time the woman is exposed to RhD positive blood, her body produces antibodies immediately. If she's pregnant with an RhD positive baby, the antibodies can cross the placenta, causing rhesus disease in the unborn baby. The antibodies can continue attacking the baby's red blood cells for a few months after birth.
Read more about the causes of rhesus disease."
Preventing rhesus disease,"Rhesus disease is uncommon these days because it can usually be prevented using injections of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin.
All women are offered blood tests as part of their antenatal checks and tests to determine whether their blood is RhD negative or positive. If the mother is RhD negative, she'll be offered injections of anti-D immunoglobulin at certain points in her pregnancy when she may be exposed to the baby's red blood cells. This anti-D immunoglobulin helps to remove the RhD foetal blood cells before they can cause sensitisation.
If a woman has developed anti-D antibodies in a previous pregnancy (she's already sensitised) then these immunoglobulin injections don't help. The pregnancy will be monitored more closely than usual, as will the baby after delivery.
Read more about preventing rhesus disease and diagnosing rhesus disease."
Treating rhesus disease,"If an unborn baby does develop rhesus disease, treatment depends on how severe it is. A blood transfusion to the unborn baby may be needed in more severe cases. After delivery, the child is likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit (a hospital unit that specialises in caring for newborn babies).
Treatment for rhesus disease after delivery can include a light treatment called phototherapy, blood transfusions, and an injection of a solution of antibodies (intravenous immunoglobulin) to prevent red blood cells being destroyed.
If rhesus disease is left untreated, severe cases can lead to stillbirth. In other cases, it could lead to brain damage, learning difficulties, hearing loss and blindness and vision loss. However, treatment is usually effective and these problems are uncommon.
Read more about treating rhesus disease and the potential complications of rhesus disease."
How rheumatic fever is treated,"If you or your child are diagnosed with rheumatic fever, you'll have treatment to relieve the symptoms and control inflammation.
You may need:
antibiotics
painkillers – given as tablets, capsules or a liquid you drink
steroid injections – if your pain is severe
medicines – if you're having jerky, uncontrollable movements
Getting plenty of bed rest will also help with your recovery.
Information:
Most people usually make a full recovery by about 3 months. But it can sometimes take longer to get better.
Ongoing treatment for rheumatic fever
If you have had rheumatic fever once, it makes it more likely that it could come back, so make sure to get sore throats treated early.
You may also have to take antibiotics for several years to help stop it returning.
It's less likely that it will come back if it's been 5 years since you last had an episode. The younger you are, the more likely it is that rheumatic fever will come back.
It can also cause permanent damage to your heart (rheumatic heart disease). This can take years to show up, so you may need regular check-ups and further treatment when you're older.
Always ask a doctor what ongoing treatment you may need."
Symptoms of rheumatic fever,"Symptoms usually appear 1 to 5 weeks after you have had a bacterial throat infection.
They include:
a high temperature
redness, pain and swelling of your joints (arthritis), usually ankles, knees, wrists or elbows
pain in your chest, breathlessness and a fast heart rate
jerky, uncontrollable movements in your hands, feet and face
tiny bumps under your skin
pale-red patches on your arms and tummy (abdomen)"
Causes of rheumatic fever,"Rheumatic fever happens after a bacterial throat or skin infection. Most people who have an infection will not get rheumatic fever.
It's not caused by the bacteria itself but by your immune system fighting off the infection and attacking the healthy tissue instead.
It's not known why your immune system can suddenly stop working properly. But your genes may make it more likely that you'll get rheumatic fever."
When to get medical advice,"See a GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so they can try to identify the underlying cause.
Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important, because early treatment can prevent it getting worse and reduce the risk of joint damage.
Find out more about diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis."
Causes of rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means your immune system (which usually fights infection) attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making the joints swollen, stiff and painful.
Over time, this can damage the joints, cartilage and nearby bone.
It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you're at an increased risk if:
you are a woman
you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis
you smoke
Find out more about the causes of rheumatoid arthritis."
Treating rheumatoid arthritis,"There's no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. However, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with the condition to have periods of months or even years between flares. This can help them to lead full lives and continue regular employment.
The main treatment options include:
medicine that is taken long term to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition
supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, to help keep you mobile and manage any problems you have with daily activities
surgery to correct any joint problems that develop
Find out more about treating rheumatoid arthritis.
Depending on how much pain, stiffness or joint damage you have, daily tasks may become difficult or take you longer to do. You may have to adapt the way you do everyday tasks.
Find out more about living with rheumatoid arthritis."
Complications of rheumatoid arthritis,"Having rheumatoid arthritis can lead to several other conditions that may cause additional symptoms and can sometimes be life threatening.
Possible complications include:
carpal tunnel syndrome
inflammation of other areas of the body (such as the lungs, heart and eyes)
an increased risk of heart attack and stroke
Making sure that rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled can help to reduce your risk of these complications.
Find out more about complications of rheumatoid arthritis."
Check if it's ringworm,"The main symptom of ringworm is a rash. It may look red or darker than the surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone.
The rash may be scaly, dry, swollen or itchy.
Ringworm can appear anywhere on the body, including the scalp (tinea capitis) and groin (jock itch).
The rash is usually ring-shaped, but it may look different on your face, neck or scalp.
Credit:
The colour of the ringworm rash may be less noticeable on brown and black skin.
Credit:
Sometimes the rash grows, spreads, or there's more than 1 rash.
Credit:
Ringworm on the face or scalp may also cause patchy hair loss.
Credit:"
A pharmacist can help with ringworm,"Speak to a pharmacist first if you think you have ringworm.
They can look at the rash and recommend the best antifungal medicine. This might be tablets, cream, gel or spray depending on where the rash is.
You may need to use an antifungal medicine every day for up to 4 weeks. It's important to use it for the right amount of time, even if the rash has gone away.
A pharmacist will tell you if they think you should see a GP.
Find a pharmacy"
How ringworm is passed on,"Ringworm is caused by a type of fungi.
It can be passed on through close contact with:
an infected person or animal
infected objects, such as bedsheets, combs or towels
infected soil, although this is less common
Information:
It's fine for your child to go to school or nursery once they've started treatment. Let your child's teachers know they have ringworm."
How to stop ringworm spreading,"Do
start treatment as soon as possible
wash towels and bedsheets regularly
keep your skin clean and wash your hands after touching animals or soil
regularly check your skin if you have been in contact with an infected person or animal
take your pet to the vet if they might have ringworm – for example, if they have patches of missing fur
Don’t
do not share towels, combs or bedsheets with someone who has ringworm
do not scratch a ringworm rash because this could spread it to other parts of your body"
Why it's needed,"The infection at the centre of a tooth (the root canal) is caused by bacteria that live in the mouth and invade the tooth.
This can happen after:
tooth decay
leaky fillings
damage to teeth as a result of trauma, such as a fall"
Tooth structure ,"A tooth is made up of 2 parts. The crown is the top part of the tooth that's visible in the mouth.
The root extends into the bone of the jaw, anchoring the tooth in position.
Teeth also consist of:
enamel – the hard outer coating
dentine – a softer material that supports the enamel and forms most of the tooth
cementum – a hard material that coats the root's surface
dental pulp – the soft tissue at the centre of the tooth
The root canal system contains the dental pulp and extends from the crown of the tooth to the end of the root.
A single tooth can have more than 1 root canal."
When root canal treatment is needed,"Root canal treatment is needed when dental X-rays show that the pulp has been damaged by a bacterial infection.
The pulp may become inflamed if it's infected by bacteria, allowing the bacteria to multiply and spread.
The symptoms of a pulp infection include:
pain when eating or drinking hot or cold food and drink
pain when biting or chewing
a loose tooth
As the infection progresses, these symptoms often disappear as the pulp dies.
Your tooth then appears to have healed, but the infection has in fact spread through the root canal system.
You eventually get further symptoms such as:
pain when biting or chewing returning
swelling of the gum near the affected tooth
pus oozing from the affected tooth
a swollen cheek or jaw
the tooth becoming a darker colour
It's important to see your dentist if you develop toothache. If your tooth is infected, the pulp cannot heal by itself.
Leaving the infected tooth in your mouth may make it worse.
There may also be less chance of the root canal treatment working if the infection within your tooth becomes established.
Antibiotics, a medicine to treat bacterial infections, are not effective in treating root canal infections. They can though help to treat infection that spreads beyond the root and causes swelling."
How root canal treatment is done,"To treat the infection in the root canal, the bacteria need to be removed.
This can be done by either:
removing the bacteria from the root canal system (root canal treatment)
removing the tooth (extraction)
But removing the tooth is not usually recommended as it's better to keep as many of your natural teeth as possible.
Before having root canal treatment, you'll usually be given a local anaesthetic.
This means the procedure should be painless and no more unpleasant than having a filling.
After the bacteria have been removed, the root canal is filled and the tooth sealed with a filling or crown.
In most cases the inflamed tissue near the tooth will heal naturally.
Root canal treatment is usually successful. In about 9 out of 10 cases a tooth can survive for up to 10 years after root canal treatment.
Find out how root canal treatment is done"
Recovering from root canal treatment,"It's important to look after your teeth when recovering from root canal treatment.
You should avoid biting on hard foods until your treatment is complete.
After your final treatment, your restored tooth should no longer be painful, although it may feel sore for a few days.
You can take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve any discomfort.
Return to your dentist if you still have pain or swelling after using painkillers.
In most cases it's possible to prevent the need for further root canal treatment by:
keeping your teeth clean
not eating too much sugary food
giving up smoking if you smoke

Check if you have rosacea,"The first signs of rosacea include:
redness (blushing) across your nose, cheeks, forehead, chin, neck and chest that comes and goes, usually lasting for a few minutes each time – your face may also feel warm, hot or painful
a burning or stinging feeling when using water or skincare products
The redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin.
As rosacea gets worse, the skin on your cheeks, nose and forehead may be red all the time.
Credit:
Rosacea may cause tiny broken blood vessels to appear on your skin that do not go away.
Credit:
You may get small pink or red bumps on your face, sometimes filled with a yellowish liquid, if you have rosacea.
Credit:
Other symptoms can include:
dry skin
swelling, especially around the eyes
yellow-orange patches on the skin
sore eyelids or crusts around roots of eyelashes – this could be blepharitis
thickened skin, mainly on the nose (usually appears after many years)
Triggers
It's not known what causes rosacea, but some things can make symptoms worse.
Common triggers for rosacea include:
alcohol
spicy foods
hot drinks
sunlight
hot or cold temperatures
aerobic exercise, like running
being stressed
Information:
If you're not sure it's rosacea
Rosacea can look a lot like other conditions, such as:
acne
contact dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis and other types of dermatitis
lupus
keratosis pilaris"
Treatment for rosacea,"Rosacea cannot be cured, but treatment from a GP can help control the symptoms. It can get worse if it's not treated.
A GP may suggest:
prescriptions for creams and gels you put on your skin
taking antibiotics for 6 to 16 weeks
A GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) if treatments are not working."
Things you can do to help rosacea,"Rosacea is not caused by poor hygiene and it's not contagious. But there are things you can try to help with symptoms.
If you know a trigger like alcohol or spicy food makes symptoms worse, try to avoid it as much as possible.
Do
wear a high SPF sunscreen of at least SPF 30 every day
try to avoid heat, sunlight or humid conditions if possible
try to cover your face in cold weather
use gentle skincare products for sensitive skin
clean your eyelids at least once a day if you have blepharitis
take steps to manage stress
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not have hot drinks
do not eat spicy food
do not do too much aerobic exercise, like running"
Check if your child has roseola,"If your child has roseola, at first they may have:
a sudden high temperature
cold-like symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose and a cough
loss of appetite
swollen eyelids and swollen glands in their neck
These symptoms last 3 to 5 days, before a rash appears.
The rash:
is made up of pinkish-red spots, patches or bumps
may be harder to see on brown or black skin
starts on the chest, tummy and back, before spreading to the face, neck and arms
is not usually itchy or uncomfortable
normally fades and disappears within 2 days
Credit:"
What to do if your child has roseola,"You can usually look after your child or baby at home with rest, fluids and painkillers. The infection should pass within a week.
Do
let your child rest if they feel unwell
make sure they drink lots of fluids
give them children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen if a high temperature makes them feel uncomfortable – check the dose on the bottle
keep your child at home while they have a high temperature –. this is when roseola is thought to be most contagious
Don’t
do not cover them up in too many clothes or bedclothes
do not give aspirin to under-16s
do not combine ibuprofen and paracetamol, unless a GP tells you to
do not give paracetamol to a child under 2 months
do not give ibuprofen to a child under 3 months or under 5kg
do not give ibuprofen to children with asthma
Once the high temperature has passed, you do not need to keep your child away from nursery if they're feeling well enough to attend. There's no need to wait until the rash disappears."
Check if you've got salivary gland stones,"Most salivary gland stones form below your tongue in one of the glands supplying saliva to your mouth. You cannot always see them.
Salivary gland stones are white and hard.
Credit:
They vary in size, but most are as big as a pea.
Credit:
Salivary gland stones may cause:
dull pain in your mouth that comes and goes
swelling in your mouth that flares up from time to time
an infection around the stone – signs of infection include pain, redness and a high temperature
If you feel intense pain during mealtimes, this could mean the stone is completely blocking a saliva gland. The pain usually lasts 1 to 2 hours."
Things you can do to try to remove salivary gland stones,"You can try to remove a salivary gland stone by doing things to increase the amount of saliva in your mouth, such as:
sucking on a lemon or lemon drops
drinking plenty of water
gently massaging around the stone
If you have pain and swelling, you can:
take paracetamol or ibuprofen
suck ice cubes or ice lollies
The symptoms will not go away until the stone has been removed.
Important
Do not use anything sharp to try to remove a salivary gland stone because it could cause injury and infection."
Treatments for salivary gland stones,"Small salivary gland stones sometimes fall out on their own.
You’ll continue to have symptoms until the stone falls out or is removed.
A GP may attempt to gently remove the stone with a thin, blunt instrument.
If that's not possible, you may need to have the stone removed in hospital."
Causes of salivary gland stones,"It's not clear what causes salivary gland stones, so there's no way to prevent them. They're not usually linked to other health problems.
Once removed, salivary gland stones do not usually come back. But if you keep getting them you might need to have 1 of your salivary glands removed."
Symptoms of sarcoidosis,"It's impossible to predict how sarcoidosis will affect a person, as the condition can affect any organ and the symptoms vary widely depending on which organs are involved.
Most people with sarcoidosis develop symptoms suddenly, but these usually clear within a few months or years and the condition does not come back. This is known as acute sarcoidosis.
Some people do not have any symptoms at all, and the condition is diagnosed after an X-ray carried out for another reason.
A few people find their symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where they become severely affected. Lots of granulomas may form in an organ and prevent it from working properly. This is known as chronic sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs, skin and lymph nodes (glands).
Lung symptoms
The lungs are affected in about 9 out of 10 of people with sarcoidosis. This is known as pulmonary sarcoidosis.
The main symptoms are shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. Some people with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience pain and discomfort in their chest, but this is uncommon.
Skin symptoms
Credit:
The skin is also affected in many people with sarcoidosis.
This can cause tender bumps or patches to develop on the skin (particularly the lower legs and arms), as well as bumps on the upper body. These can be reddish-brown or purple, depending on your skin colour and the type of sarcoidosis you have.
Other symptoms
If other organs are affected, you may also have some of the following symptoms:
tender and swollen glands in the face, neck, armpits or groin
tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell
painful joints
red or sore eyes
an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)
a blocked or stuffy nose
pain in the bones
kidney stones
headache"
Causes of sarcoidosis,"The body's immune system normally fights off infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood to isolate and destroy the germs. This results in inflammation (swelling) of the body tissues in that area. The immune system responds like this to anything in the blood it does not recognise, and this dies down when the infection has been cleared.
It's thought that sarcoidosis happens because the immune system has gone into overdrive, where the body starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting inflammation then causes granulomas to develop in the organs.
There are many similar conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, that are caused by the body attacking its own tissues. These are collectively known as autoimmune conditions.
It's not known why the immune system behaves like this.
It's possible that some environmental factor triggers the condition in people who are already genetically susceptible to it.
Sarcoidosis can occasionally occur in more than one family member, but there's no evidence that the condition is inherited. The condition is not infectious, so it cannot be passed from person to person."
Who's affected,"Sarcoidosis can affect people of any age, but usually starts in adults aged between 30 and 40. It's rare in childhood.
The condition affects people from all ethnic backgrounds. It's also more common in women than men."
Diagnosing sarcoidosis,"A number of different tests may be carried out to diagnose sarcoidosis, depending on which organs are affected.
If your symptoms suggest you have pulmonary sarcoidosis (sarcoidosis affecting the lungs), you may have a chest X-ray or a CT scan of your lungs to look for signs of the condition.
In some cases, doctors may want to examine the inside of your lungs using a long, thin, flexible tube with a light source and a camera at the end (an endoscope) that's passed down your throat. A small sample of lung tissue may also be removed during this test so it can be studied under a microscope. This is known as a biopsy.
If doctors think you may have sarcoidosis affecting other organs – such as the skin, heart or eyes – scans or examinations of these areas will usually be carried out."
How sarcoidosis is treated,"Many people with sarcoidosis do not need treatment as the condition often goes away on its own, usually within a few months or years.
In this case, simple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) are often all that's needed to control the pain of any flare-ups.
Doctors will monitor your condition to check if it's getting any better or worse without treatment. This can be done with regular X-rays, breathing tests and blood tests.
Medicines
If treatment is recommended, steroid tablets are usually used.
This helps relieve symptoms and prevent damage to affected organs by reducing inflammation and preventing scarring.
However, steroid tablets can cause side effects such as weight gain and mood swings if taken in high doses. Other side effects, such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), can also develop if steroids are taken for a long time. Therefore, they're only used when necessary.
You may initially be given a high dose of steroid medicine for a short period of time, before switching to a low dose for the months or years that follow. Your condition will be monitored during this time to see how well the treatment is working.
In some cases, taking calcium or vitamin D supplements can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medicine. However, you should only take these if advised to by a doctor. Some people with sarcoidosis may have an increased risk of developing complications, including kidney stones, while taking steroid medicine.
Other medicines may sometimes be used if steroids are not enough or there are concerns about side effects. In these cases, a medicine called an immunosuppressant might be recommended. This may help to improve your symptoms by reducing the activity of your immune system."
Living with sarcoidosis,"The following lifestyle measures may help if you have sarcoidosis:
stop smoking, if you smoke
eat a balanced diet
maintain a healthy weight
try to reduce stress
get regular exercise
get enough sleep
Find a support group on the Sarcoidosis UK website"
Outlook,"Symptoms of sarcoidosis may come and go, and can often be managed with over-the-counter painkillers so they do not affect everyday life. Most people with the condition find their symptoms have disappeared within a few years of their diagnosis.
However, for some people the condition slowly gets worse over time and they end up with organ damage. For example, their lungs may stop working properly, causing increasing breathlessness.
Help is available for people with severe, persistent sarcoidosis. Ask your doctor for advice and visit the Sarcoidosis UK website (which has a list of support groups) or the Asthma + Lung UK website."
Information about you,"If you have sarcoidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register on the National Disease Registration Service website"
Check if it's scabies,"The symptoms of scabies are:
intense itching, especially at night
a raised rash or spots
The spots may look red. They are more difficult to see on brown or black skin, but you should be able to feel them.
Tiny mites lay eggs in the skin, leaving lines with a dot at one end.
Credit:
The rash can appear anywhere, but is common between the fingers.
Credit:
The rash may then spread and turn into tiny spots. This may look red on white skin.
Credit:
The rash may leave dark spots on the skin. This may look darker than your usual skin colour on brown or black skin.
Credit:
The scabies rash usually spreads across the whole body, apart from the head and neck. It often affects skin between the fingers, around the wrists, under the arms, and around the waist, groin and bottom.
However, older people and young children may develop a rash on their head, neck, palms and soles of their feet.
People with a weakened immune system can sometimes get a rare and very contagious type of scabies, called crusted scabies. The main symptom is a crusted, flaky rash that often affects the elbows, knees, hands and feet."
A pharmacist can help with scabies,"Scabies is not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.
A pharmacist will recommend a cream or lotion that you apply over your whole body. It's important to read the instructions carefully.
Let the pharmacist know if you're breastfeeding or pregnant.
You'll need to repeat the treatment 1 week later.
Scabies is very infectious, but it can take up to 8 weeks for the rash to appear.
Everyone in your home needs to be treated at the same time, even if they do not have symptoms. But do not use pharmacy treatments on children under 2 years old, they will need to see a GP.
Anyone you’ve had sexual contact with in the past 8 weeks should also be treated.
Find a pharmacy"
Things you can do during treatment to stop scabies spreading,"If you or someone in your family has scabies there are things you can do to reduce the risk of it spreading.
Do
wash all bedding and clothing in the house at 60C or higher, and if possible in a hot dryer, on the first day of treatment
put clothing that cannot be washed in a sealed bag for 3 days until the mites die
Don’t
do not have sex or close physical contact until you have completed the full course of treatment
do not share bedding, clothing or towels with someone with scabies
How long it takes to get rid of scabies
You or your child can go back to work or school 24 hours after the first treatment.
Although the treatment kills the scabies mites quickly, the itching can carry on for a few weeks."
Scabies can spread easily,"Scabies spreads through close skin contact, including sexual contact. You cannot get scabies from pets.
People who live or work closely together in nurseries, university halls of residence or nursing homes are more at risk.
Important:
Scabies and hygiene
Anyone can get scabies. It has nothing to do with poor hygiene."
Complications of scabies,"Scratching the rash can cause skin infections like impetigo.
Scabies can make conditions like eczema or psoriasis worse."
Check if you have scarlet fever,"The first signs of scarlet fever can be flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature, a sore throat and swollen neck glands (a large lump on the side of your neck).
A rash appears 12 to 48 hours later. It looks like small, raised bumps and starts on the chest and tummy, then spreads. The rash makes your skin feel rough, like sandpaper.
On white skin the rash looks pink or red. On brown and black skin it might be harder to see a change in colour, but you can still feel the rash and see the raised bumps.
Credit:

A white coating also appears on the tongue. This peels, leaving the tongue red, swollen and covered in little bumps (called ""strawberry tongue"").
Credit:
Credit:



The rash does not appear on the face, but the cheeks can look red. The redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:
The symptoms are the same for children and adults, although scarlet fever is less common in adults."
Treating scarlet fever,"A GP will prescribe antibiotics. These will:
help you get better quicker
reduce the chance of a serious illnesses, such as pneumonia
make it less likely that you'll pass the infection on to someone else
Important:
Taking antibiotics
Keep taking the antibiotics until they're finished, even if you feel better."
Things you can do yourself,"You can relieve symptoms of scarlet fever by:
drinking cool fluids
eating soft foods if you have a sore throat
taking painkillers like paracetamol to bring down a high temperature (do not give aspirin to children under 16)
using calamine lotion or antihistamine tablets to ease itching"
How long scarlet fever lasts,"Scarlet fever lasts for around 1 week.
You can spread scarlet fever to other people until 24 hours after you take your 1st dose of antibiotics.
If you do not take antibiotics, you can spread the infection for 2 to 3 weeks after your symptoms start.
Important
If you or your child has scarlet fever, stay away from nursery, school or work for 24 hours after you take the 1st dose of antibiotics."
Is scarlet fever dangerous?,"Scarlet fever can be a serious illness, but thanks to antibiotics, it's less common than it used to be and easier to treat.
But cases of scarlet fever have increased in recent years. For more information see GOV.UK: Scarlet fever guidance and data.
Complications from scarlet fever are rare. They can happen during or in the weeks after the infection, and can include:
ear infection
throat abscess
sinusitis
pneumonia
meningitis
rheumatic fever
Pregnancy advice
There's no evidence to suggest that getting scarlet fever during pregnancy will harm your baby.
But it can make you feel unwell, so it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has it.
Contact a GP if you get symptoms.
Many of the antibiotics used for scarlet fever are considered to be safe to take during pregnancy."
How to avoid spreading scarlet fever,"Scarlet fever is very infectious and can easily spread to other people.
To reduce the chance of spreading scarlet fever:
Do
wash your hands often with soap and water
use tissues to trap germs from coughs or sneezes
bin used tissues as quickly as possible
Don’t
do not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, bedding or baths with anyone who has symptoms of scarlet fever"
Things you can do if you have a scar,"There are some things you can do to help most scars heal and improve how they look.
Do
massage your scar with a water-based cream (such as aqueous cream or E45 cream) a few times a day for up to 10 minutes each time – only massage your scar if the wound is fully healed
try to keep your scar covered when you're in the sun for at least 1 year – wear clothing that covers it, or put a dressing over it
use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more on your scar
A pharmacist can help with scars
A pharmacist can recommend some things for scars such as:
silicon dressings or gels to help improve the appearance of your scar
creams you can use to massage your scar
Find a pharmacy
Skin camouflage
There are special creams and powders (called skin camouflage) that you can apply to your skin to cover your scar so it's less noticeable.
A GP can refer you for an appointment to get skin camouflage products, or you can refer yourself online.
At your appointment, a trained professional will colour match the creams and powders to your skin and show you how to apply them.
You can get the products on a prescription or buy them."
Treatment for scars,"You cannot get rid of a scar, but most scars fade over time without any treatment.
If a scar is more severe or bothering you, a GP may be able to recommend treatments or refer you to a specialist. The aim of treatment is to help improve how the scar looks.
Depending on the type of scar you have, treatments may include:
silicone dressings or gels
steroid injections or cream
cryotherapy (a treatment to freeze the scar)
laser therapy
skin camouflage (creams and powders you use to cover your scar)
A GP can refer you for talking therapy if a scar is affecting your mental health."
Types of scars,"Scars can be many colours such as pink, red, purple, white, brown, skin-coloured or darker than the skin around it.
They can also be itchy, painful or uncomfortable.
Types of scars and what they look like
Type Symptoms
Fine-line scar
Can be slightly raised to start, but usually flattens and fades over time without treatment
Atrophic scar
Can be a deep, small hole in the skin that looks like a deep pore, or it can be a larger and slightly sunken mark; usually happens after acne or chickenpox
Keloid scar
Usually raised, hard and smooth, it grows to be bigger than the original wound, and the area where the scar is may be uncomfortable or difficult to move; it does not usually flatten or fade without treatment
Hypertrophic scar
Usually raised and firm, it does not grow to be bigger than the original wound; the area where the scar is may be uncomfortable or difficult to move; it usually fades and flattens over time
Contracture scar
Feels tight and the area where the scar is may be difficult or painful to move; it usually happens after a burn"
Localised scleroderma ,"Localised scleroderma (morphoea) can affect both children and adults.
It mostly affects the skin, causing 1 or more hard patches to develop. But it can also affect tissues such as muscle and bone under the skin.
Credit:
Exactly how the skin is affected depends on the type of localised scleroderma. There are 2 main types, called plaque and linear morphoea.
Plaque morphoea:
is most common in adults
causes 1 or more discoloured oval patches on the skin, which may be hairless and shiny
can appear anywhere on the body
may improve after a few years and treatment may not be needed
Linear morphoea:
causes thickened skin in lines – mostly along the arms and legs of children, but also on the forehead and scalp
can affect underlying bone and muscle
may improve after a few years, although it can cause permanent problems, such as shortened limbs or vision problems
Systemic sclerosis
In systemic sclerosis, internal organs can be affected as well as the skin. This type mostly affects women and usually develops between 30 and 50 years of age. Children are rarely affected.
There are 2 types of systemic sclerosis:
limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis
diffuse systemic sclerosis
Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis:
usually only affects skin on the hands, lower arms, feet, lower legs and face, although it can eventually affect the lungs and digestive system too
often starts as Raynaud's (a circulation problem where fingers and toes turn white in the cold)
can have other typical symptoms that include thickening of the skin over the hands, feet and face, red spots on the skin, hard lumps under the skin, heartburn and problems swallowing (dysphagia)
tends to get gradually worse over time, although it's generally less severe than diffuse systemic sclerosis and can often be controlled with treatment
Diffuse systemic sclerosis:
causes skin changes that can affect the whole body
is more likely to affect internal organs
has other symptoms that can include weight loss, fatigue, and joint pain and stiffness
In some cases of systemic sclerosis, organs such as the heart, lungs or kidneys are affected. This can cause a range of potentially serious problems, such as shortness of breath, high blood pressure and pulmonary hypertension."
Causes of scleroderma ,"Normally, the body's immune system fights off any germs that infect the body. It responds like this to anything in the body it doesn't recognise, and settles down when the infection has been cleared.
It's thought scleroderma occurs because part of the immune system has become overactive and out of control. This leads to cells in the connective tissue producing too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening (fibrosis) of the tissue.
It's not clear why this happens. Certain genes are thought to be involved, and having a close family member with the condition may increase your risk."
How scleroderma is treated,"The aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms, prevent the condition getting worse, detect and treat any complications (such as pulmonary hypertension) and help you maintain the use of affected parts of the body.
Common treatments include:
medication to improve circulation
medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system and slow the progression of the condition
steroids to relieve joint and muscle problems
moisturising affected areas of skin to help keep it supple and relieve itchiness
various medicines to control other symptoms (such as pain, heartburn and high blood pressure)
You will also need regular blood pressure checks and other tests to check for any problems with your organs.
If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. For example, hard lumps under the skin may need to be removed, and tightened muscles may need to be loosened.
Newer treatments such as laser therapy and photodynamic therapy may also be available."
Living with scleroderma,"There are many therapies and lifestyle changes that can help reduce the impact of scleroderma on your life.
Regular physiotherapy and stretching exercises may help keep your muscles supple and loosen tight skin.
An occupational therapist can help you adapt to any movement difficulties by suggesting changes to your home and advising you on equipment to make daily life easier.
If you're affected by Raynaud's, you'll need to keep your hands and feet warm in the cold by wearing thick gloves and socks. Read more about treating Raynaud's.
It's important to eat healthily, exercise regularly and stop smoking (if you smoke) to keep blood pressure under control and improve your circulation. Read more about controlling high blood pressure.
Many people find it helps to read up on the condition and talk to other people who are affected. Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK) work to improve the lives of people affected by scleroderma and Raynaud's."
Systemic sclerosis and pregnancy,"Women with systemic sclerosis may find it harder to get pregnant and could have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and giving birth prematurely.
However, if the pregnancy is planned in consultation with a doctor during a period when the condition is stable, there's no reason why a woman with systemic sclerosis cannot have a successful pregnancy.

Symptoms of scoliosis,"Credit:
Signs of scoliosis include:
a visibly curved spine
leaning to 1 side
uneven shoulders
1 shoulder or hip sticking out
the ribs sticking out on 1 side
clothes not fitting well
Some people with scoliosis may also have back pain. This is usually more common in adults with the condition."
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you think you or your child has scoliosis. It's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, but it's best to get it checked out.
If the GP suspects scoliosis they should refer you to a specialist. If you're diagnosed with scoliosis, they will discuss treatment options with you.
An X-ray of your back will be carried out to check how big the curve is.
You can find a specialist scoliosis centre on the Scoliosis Support & Research website."
Treatments for scoliosis,"Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe the curve is, and whether it's likely to get worse with time.
Many people will not need any treatment and only a small number will need to have surgery on their spine.
Babies and toddlers may not need treatment as the curve might improve over time. A plaster cast or plastic brace may be fitted to their back to stop the curve getting worse as they grow.
Older children may wear a back brace to stop the curve getting worse until they stop growing. Sometimes surgery may be needed to control the growth of the spine until an operation to straighten it can be done when they stop growing.
Adults may need treatment to relieve pain, such as painkillers, spinal injections and, very occasionally, surgery.
It's not clear whether back exercises help improve scoliosis, but general exercise is good for overall health and should not be avoided unless advised by your doctor.
Read more about treatments for scoliosis in children and treatments for scoliosis in adults."
Living with scoliosis,"Most people with scoliosis are able to live normal lives and can do most activities, including exercise and sports.
The condition does not usually cause significant pain or any other health problems, and tends to stay the same after you stop growing – see a GP if it gets any worse.
Having scoliosis or wearing a back brace can be tough and may cause problems with body image and self-esteem, particularly for children and teenagers.
You may find it useful to contact a support group, such as Scoliosis Support & Research.
These groups are a good source of information and support, and they may be able to put you in touch with people in a similar situation to you."
Causes of scoliosis,"In around 8 in every 10 cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis.
Idiopathic scoliosis cannot be prevented and is not thought to be linked to things such as bad posture, exercise or diet.
Your genes may make you more likely to get it though, as it sometimes runs in families.
Less commonly, scoliosis may be caused by:
the bones in the spine not forming properly in the womb – this is called congenital scoliosis and is present from birth
an underlying nerve or muscle condition, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy – this is called neuromuscular scoliosis
wear and tear of the spine with age – this is called degenerative scoliosis, which affects older adults
Scoliosis Support & Research has more information about the different types of scoliosis."
Causes of scurvy,"Scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C in your diet over a long period of time. Vitamin C is mainly found in fruit and vegetables.
However, even people who do not eat very healthily all the time are not usually considered at risk of scurvy.
Things that increase your risk of scurvy
Although scurvy is rare, you may be more at risk if you:
have no fresh fruits or vegetables in your diet for a while
eat very little food at all – possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia
smoke, as smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body gets from food
have a long-term dependency on drugs or alcohol that affects your diet
have a poor diet while pregnant or breastfeeding, because the body needs more vitamin C at these times
Babies, children and older people who find it hard to have a healthy diet may also be more at risk of scurvy."
Symptoms of scurvy,"Symptoms of scurvy may include:
feeling very tired and weak all the time
feeling irritable and sad all the time
joint, muscle or leg pain
swollen, bleeding gums (sometimes teeth can fall out)
developing red or blue spots on the skin, usually on the legs and feet, although this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin
skin that bruises easily"
Treating scurvy,"It's important that scurvy is treated quickly. Without treatment, scurvy can cause serious problems and may even be life-threatening.
Mild cases of scurvy are often easily treated by adding some vitamin C to your diet, such as from fresh fruit and vegetables.
A GP may also recommend taking vitamin C supplements (also called ascorbic acid) until you feel better.
Most people treated for scurvy feel better within days and go on to make a full recovery.
The GP may refer you to a specialist for treatment, support or advice. This depends on what's causing your scurvy."
How to prevent a vitamin C deficiency,"The best sources of vitamin C are fruit and vegetables.
The best way to prevent a vitamin C deficiency and get enough vitamins and minerals is to eat a healthy, balanced diet.
It's important to speak to a GP or midwife before taking any supplements or making changes to your diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding."
Signs of selective mutism,"Selective mutism can start at any age, but most often starts in early childhood, between age 2 and 4. It's often first noticed when the child starts to interact with people outside their family, such as when they begin nursery or school.
The main warning sign is the marked contrast in the child's ability to engage with different people, characterised by a sudden stillness and frozen facial expression when they're expected to talk to someone who's outside their comfort zone.
They may avoid eye contact and appear:
nervous, uneasy or socially awkward
rude, disinterested or sulky
clingy
shy and withdrawn
stiff, tense or poorly co-ordinated
stubborn or aggressive, having temper tantrums when they get home from school, or getting angry when questioned by parents
More confident children with selective mutism can use gestures to communicate – for example, they may nod for ""yes"" or shake their head for ""no"".
But more severely affected children tend to avoid any form of communication – spoken, written or gestured.
Some children may manage to respond with a few words, or they may speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper."
What causes selective mutism,"Experts regard selective mutism as a fear (phobia) of talking to certain people. The cause is not always clear, but it's known to be associated with anxiety.
The child will usually have a tendency to anxiety and have difficulty taking everyday events in their stride.
Find out more about anxiety in children.
Many children become too distressed to speak when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them.
If they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, it can make speaking even more stressful.
Some children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds – a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction.
This can make them ""shut down"" and be unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. Again, their anxiety can transfer to other people in that environment.
When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty.
Another misconception is that a child with selective mutism is controlling or manipulative, or has autism. There's no relationship between selective mutism and autism, although a child may have both."
Diagnosing selective mutism,"Left untreated, selective mutism can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can continue into adolescence and adulthood if not managed.
Diagnosis in children
A child can successfully overcome selective mutism if it's diagnosed at an early age and appropriately managed. 
It's important for selective mutism to be recognised early by families and schools so they can work together to reduce a child's anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools may receive training so they're able to provide appropriate support.
If you suspect your child has selective mutism and help is not available, or there are additional concerns – for example, the child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines – speak to a GP and ask them to refer you to a local specialist service for a formal diagnosis.
You can also contact a speech and language therapy clinic directly. Do not accept the opinion that your child will grow out of it or they are ""just shy"".
Your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) should be able to give you the telephone number of your nearest NHS speech and language therapy service or another specialist service that can help in your area.
Your child may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. 
The clinician may initially want to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child's development or behaviour.
They'll want to find out whether there's a history of anxiety disorders in the family, and whether anything is causing distress, such as a disrupted routine or difficulty learning a second language. They'll also look at behavioural characteristics and take a full medical history.
A person with selective mutism may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician should be prepared for this and be willing to find another way to communicate.
For example, they may encourage a child with selective mutism to communicate through their parents, or suggest that older children or adults write down their responses or use a computer. They may watch the child playing or watch a video of them speaking in a comfortable environment.
Diagnosis in adults
It's possible for adults to overcome selective mutism, although they may continue to experience the psychological and practical effects of spending years without social interaction or not being able to reach their academic or occupational potential.
Adults will ideally be seen by a mental health professional with access to support from a speech and language therapist or another knowledgeable professional.
Diagnosis guidelines
Selective mutism is diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations about the person concerned as outlined:
they do not speak in specific situations, such as during school lessons or when they can be overheard in public
they can speak normally in situations where they feel comfortable, such as when they're alone with parents at home, or in their empty classroom or bedroom
their inability to speak to certain people has lasted for at least 1 month (2 months in a new setting)
their inability to speak interferes with their ability to function in that setting
their inability to speak is not better explained by another behavioural, mental or communication disorder"
Associated difficulties,"A child with selective mutism will often have other fears and social anxieties, and they may also have additional speech and language difficulties.
They're often wary of doing anything that draws attention to them because they think that by doing so, people will expect them to talk.
For example, a child may not do their best in class after seeing other children being asked to read out good work, or they may be afraid to change their routine in case this provokes comments or questions. Many have a general fear of making mistakes.
Accidents and urinary infections may result from being unable to ask to use the toilet and holding on for hours at a time. School-aged children may avoid eating and drinking throughout the day so they do not need to excuse themselves.
Children may have difficulty with homework assignments or certain topics because they're unable to ask questions in class.
Teenagers may not develop independence because they're afraid to leave the house unaccompanied. And adults may lack qualifications because they're unable to participate in college life or subsequent interviews."
Treating selective mutism,"With appropriate handling and treatment, most children are able to overcome selective mutism. But the older they are when the condition is diagnosed, the longer it will take.
The effectiveness of treatment will depend on:
how long the person has had selective mutism
whether or not they have additional communication or learning difficulties or anxieties
the co-operation of everyone involved with their education and family life
Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but reducing the anxiety associated with speaking.
This starts by removing pressure on the person to speak. They should then gradually progress from relaxing in their school, nursery or social setting, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. 
The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce the child's anxiety by creating a positive environment for them.
This means:
not letting the child know you're anxious
reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready
concentrating on having fun
praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others, such as passing and taking toys, nodding and pointing
not showing surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other child
As well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety.
Cognitive behavioural therapy
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps a person focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people, and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure.
Behavioural therapy
Behavioural therapy concentrates on helping combat current difficulties using a gradual step-by-step approach to help conquer fears.
Techniques
There are several techniques based on CBT and behavioural therapy that are useful in treating selective mutism. These can be used at the same time by individuals, family members and school or college staff, possibly under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist.
Graded exposure
In graded exposure, situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level.
Older children and adults are encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause, such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time.
Stimulus fading
In stimulus fading, the person with selective mutism communicates at ease with someone, such as their parent, when nobody else is present.
Another person is gradually introduced into the situation and, once they're included in talking, the parent withdraws. The new person can introduce more people in the same way.
Shaping
Shaping involves using any technique that enables the person to gradually produce a response that's closer to the desired behaviour.
For example, starting with non-verbal communication, gradually moving to making eye contact, saying short words and then longer sentences and, finally, 2-way conversation.
Positive and negative reinforcement
Positive and negative reinforcement involves responding favourably to all forms of communication and not inadvertently encouraging avoidance and silence.
If the child is under pressure to talk, they'll experience great relief when the moment passes, which will strengthen their belief that talking is a negative experience.
Desensitisation
Desensitisation is a technique that involves reducing the person's sensitivity to other people hearing their voice by sharing voice or video recordings.
For example, email or instant messaging could progress to an exchange of voice recordings or voicemail messages, then more direct communication, such as telephone or Skype conversations.
You could also record your child at home and encourage them to watch or listen to themselves speaking.
Medicine
Medicine is only really appropriate for older children, teenagers and adults whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems.
Medicine should never be prescribed as an alternative to environmental changes and behavioural approaches. Though some health professionals recommend using a combination of medicine and behavioural therapies in adults with selective mutism.
However, antidepressants may be used alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels, particularly if previous attempts to engage the individual in treatment have failed."
Advice for parents,"Do not pressurise or bribe your child to encourage them to speak.
Let your child know you understand they're scared to speak and have difficulty speaking at times. Tell them they can take small steps when they feel ready and reassure them that talking will get easier.
Do not praise your child publicly for speaking because this can cause embarrassment. Wait until you're alone with them and consider a special treat for their achievement.
Reassure your child that non-verbal communication, such as smiling and waving, is fine until they feel better about talking.
Do not avoid parties or family visits, but consider what environmental changes are necessary to make the situation more comfortable for your child.
Ask friends and relatives to give your child time to warm up at his or her own pace and focus on fun activities rather than getting them to talk.
As well as verbal reassurance, give them love, support and patience."
Getting help and support,"Teenagers and adults with selective mutism can find information and support at iSpeak and the Facebook group SM SpaceCafe.
The Selective Mutism Information and Research Association (SMiRA) is another good resource for people affected by selective mutism. There's also a SMiRA Facebook page.
The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice can help you find professionals in your area with experience in treating selective mutism."
Treatment for septic arthritis,"If doctors think you have symptoms of septic arthritis:
you'll usually be treated in hospital with antibiotics given straight into a vein
fluid may be drained from the affected joint
you'll probably have to take antibiotic tablets for several weeks after you leave hospital
The average stay in hospital if you have septic arthritis is about 2 weeks. Most people start feeling better quickly once they are given antibiotics."
Causes of septic arthritis,"You can get septic arthritis if germs get into a joint. This can happen:
if you have an injury or accident to a joint
if germs from somewhere else in the body spread into the blood and then into a joint
as a complication of joint surgery
Who is at risk of septic arthritis
Anyone can get septic arthritis but some people are more at risk. This includes people:
with rheumatoid arthritis
with a weakened immune system
who have recently had joint surgery
who have an artificial joint, such as a knee or hip replacement
who inject drugs like heroin
with gonorrhoea, which is a sexually transmitted infection"
STI symptoms,"The symptoms of an STI can include:
an unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus
pain when peeing
lumps or skin growths around the genitals or bottom (anus)
a rash
unusual vaginal bleeding
itchy genitals or anus
blisters and sores around your genitals or anus
warts around your genitals or anus
warts in your mouth or throat, but this is very rare"
Why you should go to a sexual health clinic,"You can see a GP, but they'll probably refer you to a sexual health clinic if they think you may have an STI.
Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system. You can usually turn up without an appointment.
You'll often get test results quicker than from the GP and you may not have to pay a prescription fee for treatment.
You can feel comfortable sharing information about your sexual activities or orientation with a doctor. You do not need to give your real name or tell staff who the GP is if you do not want to.
No information about your visit to the clinic will be shared with the GP or anyone else outside the clinic unless you ask for it to be.
You can ask to see a female or male doctor or nurse if you wish."
What happens at a sexual health clinic,"At a sexual health clinic, a doctor or nurse:
will ask you some questions about your sex life
may ask to look at your genitals or anus
will tell you what tests they think you need
Some clinics offer home testing kits for some STIs.
If tests show you have an STI, you should tell your sexual partner and any ex-partners so they can get tested and treated as well.
If you do not want to do this, the clinic can usually do it for you without naming you."
Common types of STI,"Types of STI include:
Chlamydia
Gonorrhoea
Trichomoniasis
Genital warts
Genital herpes
Pubic lice
Scabies
Syphilis
Human papillomavirus (HPV)"
Check if you have shin splints,"Shin splints usually happen when you do exercise like running.
You'll have pain and tenderness along the front of your lower leg (shin)."
Things you can do to help with shin splints,"Shin splints usually get better within a few weeks. There are things you can do to get better quicker.
Do
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if you need them) to ease the pain
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen vegetables) in a towel on your shin for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
switch to gentle exercise such as yoga or swimming while healing
exercise on soft ground, if you can, when you're feeling better
warm up before exercise and stretch after exercise
make sure your trainers or shoes support your feet properly
Don’t
do not continue doing the exercise that caused your shin splints
do not rush back into exercise at the level you were at – build your exercise routine back up slowly"
Treatment for shin splints,"If a GP thinks you have shin splints they'll ask about your symptoms and examine your leg. If it's not getting better, they may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist.
Physiotherapy is available free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK but waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.

Self-refer for treatment
If you have shin splints, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for shin splints near you"
Causes of shin splints,"Shin splints happen when you've put too much stress on your leg.
You're more likely to get shin splints if:
you have started exercising after not being active for some time
you run or jump on hard surfaces
you do not have a good running technique"
Check if you have shingles,"The first signs of shingles can be:
a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin
a headache or feeling generally unwell
A rash will usually appear a few days later. In rare cases shingles can cause pain without a rash.
Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals.
The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles.
The blotches become itchy blisters that ooze fluid. A few days later, the blisters dry out and scab.
Credit:
The rash can be red, but this can be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:
The rash can form a cluster that only appears on 1 side of your body. The skin remains painful until after the rash has gone.
Credit:
The rash may be in and around your eye, making it sore and red. It can affect your sight or hearing and make it hard to move 1 side of your face.
Credit:"
Treatment for shingles,"Treatment for shingles depends on how severe your symptoms are and whether you're at risk of complications.
If you have a mild rash you may not need any treatment.
You may be offered medicine (antiviral tablets) to help speed up your recovery from shingles if:
you have a weakened immune system
your pain or your rash is moderate or severe
the rash is affecting other areas of your body apart from your chest, tummy and back
You usually need to start taking the medicine within 3 days of your rash first appearing.
Treatment for shingles can also include medicines to help relieve pain, such as painkillers, steroid tablets or medicines that help with nerve pain.
Information:
Shingles medicines from a pharmacy
If you have shingles, you may be able to get antiviral tablets from some pharmacies without seeing a GP.
Find a pharmacy near you"
How to treat shingles symptoms yourself,"If you have shingles there are things you can do to help with the symptoms.
Do
take paracetamol to ease pain
keep the rash clean and dry to reduce the risk of infection
wear loose-fitting clothing
use a cool compress (a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel, or a wet cloth) a few times a day
Don’t
do not let dressings or plasters stick to the rash
do not wear clothes with rough fibres that can irritate your skin"
How long shingles lasts,"It can take up to 4 weeks for the shingles rash to heal.
Your skin can be painful for weeks after the rash has gone, but it usually gets better over time."
Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles,"You cannot spread shingles to others. But people could catch chickenpox from you if they have not had chickenpox before or have not had the chickenpox vaccine.
This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.
Try to avoid:
anyone who is pregnant and has not had chickenpox before
people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy
babies less than 1 month old
Important:
Work and school
Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out.
You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid.
You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing."
Complications of shingles,"Most people recover from shingles without any problems. But it can sometimes cause complications, such as:
post-herpetic neuralgia, where pain lasts for several months after the shingles rash has gone
the rash becoming infected, which may need to be treated with antibiotics
scarring or changes in skin colour after the rash has healed
muscle weakness
eye problems, which can lead to sight loss
Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare condition where shingles affects your facial nerve, causing weakness on one side of your face and sometimes hearing problems
You can reduce the risk of complications by getting treatment as soon as possible after your symptoms start.
Shingles and pregnancy
If you're pregnant and get shingles, it's mostly mild and there's usually no risk to you or your baby.
But a GP should arrange for a specialist to advise on whether you need treatment."
Causes of shingles,"You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.
But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.
When people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is weakened.
This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy."
Shingles vaccine,"A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:
people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023
people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated
people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system
The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles.
If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.
You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before.
Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS."
Causes of shortness of breath,"Shortness of breath has lots of different causes.
Common causes include:
asthma
a chest infection
being overweight
smoking
a panic attack
But sometimes shortness of breath could be a sign of something more serious, such as:
a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
scarring of the lungs known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
heart failure
lung cancer
Any treatment you may need depends on what's causing your symptoms.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of shortness of breath – always see a GP."
Symptoms of shoulder impingement,"Shoulder impingement can start suddenly or come on gradually.
Symptoms include:
pain in the top and outer side of your shoulder
pain that's worse when you lift your arm, especially when you lift it above your head
pain or aching at night, which can affect your sleep
weakness in your arm
Your shoulder will not usually be stiff. If it is, you might have a frozen shoulder instead."
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you have shoulder pain that does not go away after a few weeks or is stopping you from doing your normal activities.
They'll look at your shoulder and ask you to move your arm in different ways to see how easily you can move it and if movement makes the pain worse.
They may suggest some treatments you can try or refer you to a physiotherapist for treatment advice. You probably will not need to go to hospital for any scans.
You can also go straight to a physiotherapist without seeing a GP, but you might need to pay.
Read about finding a physiotherapist"
Things you can do if you have shoulder impingement,"Avoid things that make the pain worse – avoid activities that involve repeatedly lifting your arm above your head (such as swimming or playing tennis) for a few days or weeks. Ask a GP or physiotherapist when you can restart these activities.
Do not stop moving your arm completely – try to carry on with your normal daily activities as much as possible so your shoulder does not become weak or stiff. It's usually best to avoid using a sling.
Gently hold an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your shoulder for 15 to 20 minutes a few times a day.
Take painkillers – anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as ibuprofen) or paracetamol may help. A GP can prescribe stronger painkillers if needed."
Treatments for shoulder impingement,"Shoulder exercises
A GP may be able to advise you about simple shoulder exercises you can do.
Physiotherapists can also diagnose shoulder impingement and suggest exercises to help improve shoulder posture and further strengthen your muscles to improve your pain and range of movement.
You may need to do these exercises with a physiotherapist at first, but after a while you'll usually be able to continue doing them at home.
Go back to a GP or physiotherapist if the exercises make your pain worse or your pain does not improve after a few weeks.
Steroid injections
Steroid injections into your shoulder can help relieve pain if rest and exercises on their own do not help.
But it's still important to do your shoulder exercises, as injections usually only have an effect for a few weeks and your pain may come back if you stop the exercises.
While the injection can be repeated if needed, having more than 2 is not usually recommended because it might damage the tendon in your shoulder in the long term.
The injections can also have side effects, such as permanent dimpling or lightening of the skin where the injection is given.
Surgery
An operation called a subacromial decompression may be an option if other treatments have not worked, although there's some uncertainty about how much it helps.
The operation involves widening the space around the rotator cuff tendon so it does not rub or catch on anything nearby.
The operation is usually done using small surgical instruments passed through small cuts in your shoulder.
This is a type of keyhole surgery known as arthroscopy.
It's usually done under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep.
Most people can go home the same day or the day after surgery and are able to use their shoulder normally again after a few weeks."
Causes of shoulder impingement,"When you lift your arm, the rotator cuff tendon passes through a narrow space at the top of your shoulder, known as the subacromial space.
Shoulder impingement happens when the tendon rubs or catches on the bone at the top of this space, called the acromion.
This can be caused by:
the tendon becoming swollen, thickened or torn – this can be due to an injury, overuse of the shoulder (for example, from sports such as swimming or tennis) or ""wear and tear"" with age
the fluid-filled sac (bursa) found between the tendon and acromion becoming irritated and inflamed (bursitis) – this can also be caused by an injury or overuse of the shoulder
the acromion being curved or hooked, rather than flat – this tends to be something you're born with
bony growths (spurs) on the acromion – these can develop as you get older"
How to ease shoulder pain yourself,"You usually need to do these things for 2 weeks before shoulder pain starts to ease.
It can take 6 months or longer to recover from shoulder pain.
Do
stay active and gently move your shoulder
try shoulder exercises for 6 to 8 weeks to stop pain returning
stand up straight with your shoulders down and gently back
sit with a cushion behind your lower back
rest your arm on a cushion in your lap
use pain relief so you can keep moving – try painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen, and heat or cold packs
Putting heat or cold packs on your shoulder
Don’t
do not completely stop using your shoulder – this can stop it getting better
do not do things that seem to make it worse
do not make up your own strenuous exercises or use heavy gym equipment
do not slouch when sitting – do not roll your shoulders or bring your neck forward
A pharmacist can help with shoulder pain
A pharmacist may suggest:
the best painkiller – this might be tablets, or a cream or gel you rub on your skin
other ideas for pain relief and things you can buy to help, like heat and cold packs
seeing a GP if you need to
Find a pharmacy"
Treatments for shoulder pain,"A GP will examine you to work out what's causing your shoulder pain.
They might send you for tests (such as an X-ray) to check the cause.
They'll suggest a treatment based on the cause, for example:
stronger medicine or injections to ease pain and swelling
physiotherapy or exercises to do at home
things to avoid to stop the pain getting worse or returning
seeing a specialist for tests or treatment
Physiotherapy for shoulder pain
The number of physiotherapy sessions you may have depends on the cause of your shoulder pain.
If you're still in pain after your sessions end, go back to the GP. They might prescribe more physiotherapy or suggest another treatment.
Physiotherapy is available through the NHS, but waiting times can be long. You can also pay to get physiotherapy privately.

To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for shoulder pain near you"
Causes of shoulder pain,"Shoulder pain that does not improve after 2 weeks might be caused by something that needs treatment.
But do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
Symptoms and possible causes of shoulder pain
Shoulder symptoms Possible causes
Pain and stiffness that does not go away over months or years
Frozen shoulder, arthritis (osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis)
Pain that's often worse while using your arm or shoulder
Tendonitis, bursitis, impingement
Tingling, numb, weak arm, feels like the shoulder is clicking or locking
Shoulder instability, sometimes because of hypermobility
Sudden very bad pain, cannot move your arm (or it's difficult), sometimes changes shape
Dislocated shoulder, broken bone (such as a broken arm or broken collarbone), torn or ruptured tendon
Pain on top of the shoulder (where the collarbone and shoulder joint meet)
Problems in the acromioclavicular joint, like dislocation or stretched or torn ligaments"
Check if you have sick building syndrome,"Symptoms of sick building syndrome get worse the longer you're in a particular building and get better after you leave.
Other people in the building may also have symptoms.
Possible symptoms include:
headaches
blocked or runny nose
dry, itchy skin
dry, sore eyes or throat
cough or wheezing
skin rashes
tiredness and difficulty concentrating
Information:
These symptoms are common and can be caused by lots of things. They're unlikely to be a sign of sick building syndrome if you have them all the time, or when you're in lots of different places."
What to do if you think you have sick building syndrome,"If you think you have sick building syndrome speak to:
your manager or employer – if you get symptoms at work
the building manager or owner (such as the landlord) – if you get symptoms in another building
They should look into the problem and try to find a solution.
You can also get help and advice from the environmental health service at your local authority or your local Health and Safety Executive (HSE) office."
How to ease symptoms of sick building syndrome yourself,"There are some things you can do that may help ease symptoms of sick building syndrome.
Do
open windows to improve ventilation, if you can
set the temperature at about 19C and do not change it lots of times during the day
try to reduce stress
take regular screen breaks if you use a computer
go outside for some fresh air during lunchtime and other breaks"
Causes of sick building syndrome,"It's not clear exactly what causes sick building syndrome.
It's probably due to a combination of things, such as:
poor ventilation or poorly maintained air conditioning systems
dust, smoke, fumes or fabric fibres in the air
bright or flickering lights
problems with cleaning and layout, such as crowded desks
Sick building syndrome mostly happens in open-plan offices."
Symptoms of sickle cell disease,"People born with sickle cell disease tend to have problems from early childhood, although some children have few symptoms and lead normal lives most of the time.
The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are:
painful episodes called sickle cell crises, which can be very severe and last for days or weeks
an increased risk of serious infections
anaemia (where red blood cells cannot carry enough oxygen around the body), which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath
Some people also experience other problems, such as delayed growth, strokes and lung problems.
Find out more about the symptoms of sickle cell disease"
Causes of sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene that affects how red blood cells develop.
If both parents have the gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with sickle cell disease.
The child's parents often will not have sickle cell disease themselves and they're only carriers of the sickle cell trait.
Find out more about the causes of sickle cell disease"
Screening and testing for sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth.
Screening for sickle cell disease in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and all babies are offered screening as part of the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test).
Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for sickle cell disease or see if you're a carrier of the gene that causes it.
Find out more about screening and testing for sickle cell disease"
Treatments for sickle cell disease,"People with sickle cell disease need treatment throughout their lives. This is usually delivered by different health professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre.
It's also important for people with sickle cell disease to look after their own health using self care measures, such as by avoiding triggers and managing pain.
A number of treatments for sickle cell disease are available.
For example:
drinking plenty of fluids and staying warm to prevent painful episodes
painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (sometimes treatment with stronger painkillers in hospital may be necessary)
daily antibiotics and having regular vaccinations to reduce your chances of getting an infection
a medicine called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) to reduce symptoms
regular blood transfusions if symptoms continue or get worse, or there are signs of damage caused by sickle cell disease
an emergency blood transfusion if severe anaemia develops
The only cure for sickle cell disease is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, but they're not done very often because of the risks involved.
Read more about how sickle cell disease is treated and living with sickle cell disease."
Outlook for sickle cell disease,"Sickle cell disease varies between individuals from mild to serious, but most people with it lead happy and normal lives.
Mild sickle cell disease may have no impact on a person's day-to-day life.
But the illness can be serious enough to have a significant effect on a person's life.
It can lead to health problems like strokes, serious infections and lung problems, which can occasionally be fatal.
Overall, the life expectancy for someone with sickle cell disease tends to be shorter than normal, but this can vary depending on the exact type of sickle cell disease they have, how it's treated and what problems they experience."
Carriers of sickle cell (sickle cell trait),"A carrier of sickle cell is someone who carries the gene that causes sickle cell disease but does not have sickle cell disease themselves. It's also known as having the sickle cell trait.
People with the sickle cell trait will not develop sickle cell disease, but are at risk of having a child with it if their partner is also a carrier.
You can request a blood test to check if you carry the sickle cell trait from your GP surgery or the nearest sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.
Find out more about being a sickle cell carrier"
More information and support,"Finding out as much as possible about sickle cell disease may help you feel more in control of your illness.
The Sickle Cell Society is a UK charity for people with sickle cell disease.
Their website has a wide range of useful information, including news about research into the condition and details of support groups."
Signs and symptoms,"The symptoms of silicosis usually take many years to develop, and you may not notice any problems until after you've stopped working with silica dust.
The symptoms can also continue to get worse, even if you're no longer exposed.
Silicosis usually develops after being exposed to silica for 10-20 years, although it can sometimes develop after 5-10 years of exposure. Occasionally, it can occur after only a few months of very heavy exposure.
Main symptoms
The main symptoms of silicosis are:
a persistent cough
persistent shortness of breath
weakness and tiredness
If the condition continues to get worse, these symptoms may become more severe.
Some people may eventually find simple activities such as walking or climbing stairs very difficult and may be largely confined to their house or bed.
The condition can ultimately be fatal if the lungs stop working properly (respiratory failure) or serious complications develop, but this is rare in the UK.
Further problems
Silicosis can also increase your risk of getting other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, including:
tuberculosis (TB) and other chest infections
pulmonary hypertension
heart failure
arthritis
kidney disease
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
lung cancer"
When to see your GP,"See your GP if you think there's a possibility you could have silicosis.
They'll ask you about your symptoms and work history, and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope.
They'll want to know about any periods when you may have been exposed to silica and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working.
If silicosis is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.
Tests you may have include:
a chest X-ray to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs
a computerised tomography (CT) scan of your chest to produce more detailed images of your lungs
lung function testing (spirometry), which involves breathing into a machine called a spirometer to assess how well your lungs are working
A test for TB may also be recommended because you're more likely to get TB if you have silicosis."
Treating silicosis,"There's no cure for silicosis because the lung damage can't be reversed. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.
The condition may continue to get worse, leading to further lung damage and serious disability, although this may happen very slowly over many years.
The risk of complications may be reduced if you:
ensure you're not exposed to any more silica
stop smoking (if you smoke)
have regular tests to check for TB, if advised by your doctor
have the annual flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine
You may be offered long-term home oxygen therapy if you're having difficulty breathing and have low levels of oxygen in your blood.
Bronchodilator medicines may also be prescribed to widen your airways and make breathing easier.
You'll be given a course of antibiotics if you develop a bacterial chest infection.
In very severe cases, a lung transplant may be an option, although there are strict health requirements to meet before this will be considered."
Preventing silicosis,"Silicosis can be prevented by avoiding prolonged exposure to silica dust.
In the UK, all workplaces must comply with The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, which sets a workplace exposure limit for silica.
Your employer should:
warn you about any risks to your health
make sure you're aware of the correct procedures to reduce your risk of exposure to silica dust
supply you with the necessary equipment to protect you
Further information:
Health and Safety Executive: Control of exposure to silica dust
Health and Safety Executive: The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations – Guidance"
Claiming compensation,"If you've been diagnosed with silicosis, you may be able to claim compensation in one of the following ways:
industrial injuries disablement benefit – a sum of money paid weekly to people with silicosis who were exposed to silica while in employment (but not self-employment) and to people who have silicosis and lung cancer
launch a civil claim for compensation through the courts (you'll need to get legal advice about how to do this)
claim a lump sum in compensation under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 – if you have silicosis, or you're the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer liable has stopped trading

Check if it's sinusitis,"Sinusitis is common after a cold or flu.
The main symptoms of sinusitis include:
pain, swelling and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead
a blocked or runny nose
a reduced sense of smell
green or yellow mucus from your nose
a high temperature
Other symptoms include:
a headache
toothache
bad breath
a cough
a feeling of pressure in the ears
You may also snore at night and sound nasal when you speak.
Young children may also be irritable, have difficulty feeding and breathe through their mouth."
How you can treat sinusitis yourself,"You can often treat mild sinusitis without seeing a GP by:
getting plenty of rest
drinking plenty of fluids
taking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16)
avoiding things that trigger your allergies
not smoking
cleaning your nose with a salt water solution
How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution
If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.
A pharmacist can help with sinusitis
A pharmacist can advise you about medicines that can help, such as:
decongestant nasal sprays or drops to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be taken by children under 6)
salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose
They can also provide other treatments if you need them, without you seeing a GP.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for sinusitis,"If a GP thinks your sinusitis needs treatment, they may prescribe medicines such as:
steroid nasal sprays or drops to reduce the swelling in your sinuses – you might need to take these for a few months
antihistamines if an allergy is causing your symptoms
Rarely, you may need antibiotics. This is not common as sinusitis is usually caused by a virus, not bacteria.
The GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if you:
still have sinusitis after 3 months of treatment
keep getting sinusitis
only have symptoms on 1 side of your face
The specialist may recommend surgery for some people.
Surgery for sinusitis
Surgery to treat chronic sinusitis is called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).
FESS is carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep).
The surgeon can widen your sinuses by either:
removing some of the blocked tissue
inflating a tiny balloon in the blocked sinuses, then removing it"
Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome,"The symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome include:
dry eyes
a dry mouth
dry skin
tiredness
vaginal dryness
muscle or joint pain
swelling between the jaw and ears (swollen salivary glands)
rashes (especially after being in the sun)"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you have symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome that do not go away or are bothering you.
There are many things that can cause similar symptoms. The GP can check for some of the more common causes, such as swelling of the eyelids (blepharitis), diabetes or side effects from medicine.
If needed, they can refer you to a specialist for further tests, such as:
blood tests
an eye examination
a lip biopsy – where a tiny piece of tissue from inside your lip is removed and examined under a microscope
Find out more about the tests for Sjögren's syndrome."
Things you can do if you have Sjögren's syndrome,"To help relieve the symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome:
avoid dry, smoky or windy places
avoid reading, watching TV or looking at screens for a long time
make sure you maintain good oral hygiene
do not smoke or drink alcohol"
Treatments for Sjögren's syndrome,"There's currently no cure for Sjögren's syndrome, but there are several treatments that can help, such as:
eye drops that keep your eyes wet (artificial tears)
sprays, lozenges (medicated sweets) and gels that keep your mouth wet (saliva substitutes)
medicine that helps your body produce more tears and saliva"
Causes of Sjögren's syndrome,"Sjögren's syndrome is caused by the immune system (the body's defence against infection), damaging healthy parts of the body. This is known as an autoimmune condition.
The condition usually affects areas of the body that produce fluids, such as tears and saliva. But other parts of the body, such as nerves and joints, can also be affected.
It's not clear why the immune system stops working properly.
It may be linked to:
genetics – some people may be born with genes that make them more likely to get an autoimmune condition
hormones – the female hormone oestrogen may play a part, as the condition is much more common in women than men
Sometimes, people with Sjögren's syndrome also have other autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This is known as secondary Sjögren's syndrome.
Primary Sjögren's syndrome is where you do not have any other related conditions."
Living with Sjögren's syndrome,"Sjögren's syndrome is a long-term condition that does not usually get better on its own, although the symptoms can often be treated.
For some people it may just be a bit of a nuisance, while for others it can have a big impact on their daily life.
Some people may develop complications of Sjögren's syndrome, such as problems with their vision or lungs.
There's also a slightly increased risk of a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
If you're diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome, ask your doctor about what you can expect.
You may also find it useful to contact organisations such as the British Sjögren's Syndrome Association (BSSA) for advice and support."
Check if you have a skin abscess,"A skin abscess is a lump or swelling on your skin that contains pus. There are different types and they can appear anywhere on your body.
A skin abscess will often be round and feel painful and warm. The middle of the lump may feel soft when touched.
Pus may leak from the abscess and you may have a high temperature.
On white skin, an abscess will often appear red. The colour of an abscess may be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:
Credit:"
Treatments for skin abscesses,"Treatment for a skin abscess will depend on what type of abscess you have.
The abscess may need be drained to get rid of the pus. This usually involves a small operation to make a cut in the skin which will allow the pus to drain. You may be given a local anaesthetic so you do not feel anything when the abscess is drained.
You may also be given antibiotics if the abscess is infected."
Causes of skin abscesses,"Skin abscesses are usually caused by an infection.
It's normal to have bacteria on your skin without it causing an infection. However, bacteria can sometimes get into your skin, for example through a cut or along a hair follicle. This can cause pus to form, creating an abscess.
You may be more likely to get skin abscesses if you:
smoke
are living with obesity
have diabetes
are between 15 and 40 years old
have a skin condition or inflammation such as eczema"
Check if it's a skin cyst,"Skin cysts:
are round lumps just underneath the skin
often contain fluid or pus
sometimes have a small, dark spot in the middle
grow slowly and vary in size from smaller than a pea to several centimetres across
can get sore or red if they get infected – the redness may be harder to see on black or brown skin
Credit:
Credit:
Skin cysts can form on most areas of the body, including the head, face, neck, chest and back. It's also possible to get them on the scrotum or inside the vagina."
Treatments for a skin cyst,"Skin cysts do not need to be treated if they're not causing any problems.
But treatment may be recommended if you have:
an infected skin cyst – you may be given antibiotics
a large, painful cyst which interferes with everyday life – for example, a cyst on your head that catches when you brush your hair
Skin cyst removal
If you have a large, painful skin cyst which is making everyday tasks difficult, you may be able to have it removed on the NHS.
If it's not causing any problems but is on a visible part of your body, such as on your face, you may choose to have it removed. But you'll probably have to pay for this privately.
Local anaesthetic is used to numb the area around the cyst before it's cut out. You'll have a small scar after the wound has healed.
You may also get new skin cysts in the future.
Important
Do not squeeze a skin cyst. If it bursts it could become infected, or if it's already infected you might spread the infection."
Types of skin cyst,"There are lots of different types of skin cyst. Here are some of the main types.
Different types of cyst
Location Type
A cyst that develops in the top layer of skin (epidermis)
Epidermoid cyst (sometimes known as a sebaceous cyst)
A cyst that forms in a hair follicle, usually on the scalp
Pilar cyst (also sometimes known as a sebaceous cyst)
A cyst in a joint or tendon, most commonly on the wrists, hands and fingers
Ganglion cyst
A fluid-filled swelling on the back of the knee
Baker's cyst
A small, fluid-filled lump just inside the opening of the vagina
Bartholin's cyst
A small lump or swelling on the eyelid
Meibomian cyst or chalazion"
Causes of skin cysts,"Anyone can get a skin cyst and it's not always known what causes them.
You may be more likely to get a skin cyst if:
a family member also has cysts (particularly pilar cysts)
you're an adult, particularly in middle age
you're a woman
you have acne
you have a rare condition, such as Gardner syndrome
Skin cysts are not cancerous and you cannot get them from someone who has one."
Check if you have skin picking disorder,"Most people pick at their skin from time to time, but you may have skin picking disorder if you:
cannot stop picking your skin
cause cuts, bleeding or bruising by picking your skin
pick moles, freckles, spots or scars to try to ""smooth"" or ""perfect"" them
do not always realise you're picking your skin or do it when you're asleep
pick your skin when you feel anxious or stressed
You may pick your skin with your fingers, fingernails, teeth or with tools like tweezers, pins or scissors."
Things you can try if you have skin picking disorder,"Do
keep your hands busy – try squeezing a soft ball or putting on gloves
identify when and where you most commonly pick your skin and try to avoid these triggers
try to resist for longer and longer each time you feel the urge to pick
care for your skin when you get the urge to pick it – for example, by applying moisturiser
tell other people – they can help you recognise when you're picking
keep your skin clean to avoid infection
Don’t
do not let your nails grow long – keep them trimmed
do not keep things like tweezers and pins where you can easily get at them"
Treatment for skin picking disorder,"Talking therapy for skin picking disorder
Talking therapy is currently thought to be an effective treatment to help change skin picking behaviour.
If you're offered this, it'll usually be given through community mental health services.
The most common type of talking therapy offered for skin picking disorder is cognitive behavioural therapy, and may include a technique called habit reversal training.
Habit reversal training works by helping you:
recognise and be more aware of your skin picking and what's triggering it
replace skin picking with a less harmful behaviour
Medicines for skin picking disorder
Your doctors may recommend some types of medicine to help you control your skin picking behaviour.
This may be prescribed by a GP, but more often it'll be prescribed by a specialist (psychiatrist)."
Causes of skin picking disorder,"Skin picking disorder is related to obsessive compulsive disorder, where the person cannot stop themselves carrying out a particular action.
It can be triggered by:
boredom
stress or anxiety
negative emotions, such as guilt or shame
skin conditions, such as acne or eczema
other blemishes that the person wants to get rid of (these may not be noticeable to other people)
It's sometimes called a body-focused repetitive behaviour and is similar to repetitive hair pulling disorder (trichotillomania).
It's also related to other obsessive compulsive disorders, such as body dysmorphic disorder, where the person is excessively preoccupied with their appearance.
People with skin picking disorder often also have other obsessive compulsive disorders. These may require their own assessment and treatment."
Check if it's a skin tag,"Skin tags are usually the same colour as the rest of your skin, or a little darker. They can look like they're hanging off the skin. They do not usually hurt and are normally harmless.
Skin tags often grow where your skin rubs together or where there are folds in your skin.
This means they usually appear:
on your neck
under your arms
on your eyelids
under your breasts
around your bottom
Skin tags range in size from around 2mm to 5cm. You may get one or you may get a large group of them.

Credit:
Differences between skin tags, warts and moles
Skin tags can sometimes be confused with warts or moles, but they are different.
Warts are more commonly found on the hands and feet. Most warts are firm, raised off the skin and have a rough surface.
Moles are usually found on areas of skin exposed to the sun. They are usually a different colour to the rest of your skin and can be pink, light brown, brown or darker brown depending on the colour of your skin tone. Moles are usually flat and round or oval."
Treatment for skin tags,"Skin tags do not need to be removed, but if they're causing problems they can be removed:
using heat
by freezing them
by cutting them off with a surgical blade or scissors
Once a skin tag is removed it does not usually return.
Removing skin tags can cause scarring or darken skin (hyperpigmentation) where the skin tag was, particularly on black or brown skin. These effects are usually temporary, although it can sometimes be permanent."
Causes of skin tags,"The cause of skin tags is not always known, but they are sometimes caused by skin rubbing against skin.
Anyone can get skin tags and they cannot be prevented, but you may be more likely to get them if:
you're living with obesity or have skin folds that rub together
you have type 2 diabetes, because severe insulin resistance is thought to cause more skin tags to grow
you're pregnant, as hormonal changes are thought to cause skin tag growth"
Check if it's slapped cheek syndrome,"The first sign of slapped cheek syndrome is usually feeling unwell for a few days.
Symptoms may include:
a high temperature
a runny nose and sore throat
a headache
A red rash may appear on 1 or both cheeks. It may be less obvious on brown and black skin. Adults do not usually get the rash on their face.
Credit:
A few days later, a spotty rash may appear on the chest, arms and legs. The rash can be raised and itchy. It may be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:"
Things you can do yourself,"You do not usually need to see a GP for slapped cheek syndrome.
There are some things you can do to ease the symptoms.
Do
rest
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – babies should continue their normal feeds
take paracetamol or ibuprofen for a high temperature, headaches or joint pain
use moisturiser on itchy skin
speak to a pharmacist about itchy skin – they can recommend the best antihistamine for children
Don’t
do not give aspirin to children under 16"
How slapped cheek syndrome is spread,"It's hard to avoid spreading slapped cheek syndrome because most people do not know they have it until they get the rash.
You can only spread it to other people before the rash appears.
Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus (parvovirus B19). The virus spreads to other people, surfaces or objects by coughing or sneezing near them.
To reduce the risk of spreading the virus:
wash your hands often with water and soap
use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as quickly as possible
Information:
You do not have to stay off work or school after the rash appears.
Let the school or teacher know if your child has slapped cheek syndrome."
What happens during sleep paralysis,"During sleep paralysis you may feel:
awake but cannot move, speak or open your eyes
like someone is in your room
like something is pushing you down
frightened
These feelings can last up to several minutes."
Causes of sleep paralysis,"Sleep paralysis happens when you cannot move your muscles as you are waking up or falling asleep. This is because you are in sleep mode but your brain is active.
It's not clear why sleep paralysis can happen but it has been linked with:
insomnia
disrupted sleeping patterns – for example, because of shift work or jet lag
narcolepsy – a long-term condition that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
generalised anxiety disorder
panic disorder
a family history of sleep paralysis"
Things you can do to help prevent sleep paralysis,"You may be able to prevent sleep paralysis by changing your sleeping habits.
Do
try to regularly get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a day
go to bed at roughly the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning
get regular exercise, but not in the 4 hours before going to bed
Don’t
do not eat a big meal, smoke, or drink alcohol or caffeine shortly before going to bed
do not sleep on your back – this can make sleep paralysis more likely to happen"
Treating sleep paralysis,"A GP may be able to treat an underlying condition that could be triggering sleep paralysis such as insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder.
If this does not help they might refer you to a doctor who specialises in sleep conditions.
Treatment from a specialist
You might be given medicine usually used to treat depression. Taking this type of medicine at a lower dose can also help with sleep paralysis.
You might also be referred for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)."
Why some people sleepwalk,"The exact cause of sleepwalking is unknown, but it seems to run in families. You're more likely to sleepwalk if other members of your close family have or had sleepwalking behaviours or night terrors.
The following things can trigger sleepwalking or make it worse:
not getting enough sleep
stress and anxiety
infection with a high temperature, especially in children
drinking too much alcohol
taking drugs
certain types of medicine, such as some sedatives
being startled by a sudden noise or touch, causing abrupt waking from deep sleep
waking up suddenly from deep sleep because you need to go to the toilet
Other sleep disorders that can cause you to frequently wake up suddenly during the night, such as obstructive sleep apnoea and restless legs syndrome, can also trigger a sleepwalking episode.
Taking steps to prevent some of these triggers – such as making sure you get enough sleep, and working on strategies to deal with and reduce stress – will often help."
What happens when a person sleepwalks,"In some episodes of sleepwalking, a person may just sit up in bed and look around, briefly appearing confused. Others may get out of bed and walk about, open cupboards, get dressed or eat, and they may appear agitated.
In extreme cases, the person may walk out of the house and carry out complex activities, such as driving a car.
The eyes are usually open while someone is sleepwalking, although the person will look straight through people and not recognise them. They can often move well around familiar objects.
If you talk to a person who is sleepwalking, they may partially respond or say things that do not make sense.
Most sleepwalking episodes last less than 10 minutes, but they can be longer. At the end of each episode, the person may wake up, or return to bed and go to sleep.
They will not normally have any memory of it in the morning or may have patchy memory. If woken while sleepwalking, the person may feel confused and not remember what happened."
What to do if you find someone sleepwalking,"The best thing to do if you see someone sleepwalking is to make sure they're safe. If undisturbed, they will often go back to sleep again. Gently guide them back to bed by reassuring them.
Do not shout or startle the person and do not try to physically restrain them unless they're in danger, as they may lash out."
When to get medical advice,"Occasional sleepwalking episodes do not usually need medical attention. Sleepwalking is rarely a sign of anything serious and may get better with time, particularly in children.
But, you should consider seeing a GP if sleepwalking happens frequently, you're concerned a person may be at risk of injuring themselves or others, or the episodes continue or start in adult life.
The GP may refer you to a specialist sleep centre, where your or your child's sleep history can be discussed in more detail. If appropriate, sleep studies can be arranged to exclude other conditions that could be triggering the sleepwalking, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome."
Treatments for sleepwalking,"There's no specific treatment for sleepwalking, but it generally helps to try to get enough sleep and have a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime. 
You may find the following advice helpful:
try to go to bed at a similar time each night
make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet when you go to sleep
limit drinks before bedtime, particularly ones containing caffeine, and go to the toilet before going to sleep
find ways to relax before going to bed, such as having a warm bath, reading or deep breathing
if your child sleepwalks at the same time most nights, try gently waking them for a short time 15 to 30 minutes before they would normally sleepwalk – this may stop them sleepwalking by altering their normal sleep cycle
Read about sleep and young children.
Medicine is not usually used to treat sleepwalking. However, medicines such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants are sometimes used if you sleepwalk often or there's a risk you could seriously injure yourself or others. These medicines can help you sleep and may reduce the frequency of sleepwalking episodes.
Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy may sometimes be helpful."
Preventing accidents,"It's important to keep the areas of your home where a person may sleepwalk free of breakable or potentially harmful objects and to remove any items they could trip over. It's also a good idea to keep windows and doors locked.
If your child sleepwalks, do not let them sleep on the top bed of a bunk bed. You may want to fit safety gates at the top of the stairs.
It's also important to tell babysitters, relatives or friends who look after your child at night that your child may sleepwalk and what they should do if it happens."
Check if it's a slipped disc,"A slipped disc (also called a prolapsed or herniated disc) can cause:
lower back pain
numbness or tingling in your shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs or feet
neck pain
problems bending or straightening your back
muscle weakness
pain in the buttocks, hips or legs if the disc is pressing on the sciatic nerve (sciatica)
Not all slipped discs cause symptoms. Many people will never know they have slipped a disc."
How you can ease the pain from a slipped disc yourself,"Keep active
If the pain is very bad, you may need to rest at first. But start gentle exercise as soon as you can – it'll help you get better faster.
The type of exercise is not important, just gradually increase your activity level.
Take painkillers
Alternate painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. Paracetamol on its own is not recommended for back pain.
Take them regularly (up to the recommended daily amount) rather than just when the pain is particularly bad. This will help you to keep moving."
A pharmacist can help with a slipped disc,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are not suitable for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist if you're not sure.
Stronger painkillers containing codeine may help for pain that's just started.
But these types of painkillers can cause addiction and should only be used for a few days.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatment for a slipped disc,"A GP might prescribe a stronger painkiller, a steroid injection or a muscle relaxant to use in the short term.
If your symptoms do not get better, a GP might recommend further tests, like an MRI scan.
They might also refer you to a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy from the NHS might not be available everywhere and waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.

Surgery for a slipped disc
Surgery is not usually needed, but a GP might refer to you a specialist to discuss surgery if your symptoms:
have not improved using other treatments
include worsening muscle weakness, or numbness
Alternative treatments for a slipped disc
There's some evidence that manual therapies, like osteopathy, can help ease lower back pain.
You'll usually have to pay for this treatment privately"
What causes a slipped disc,"They can happen because of:
ageing
exercising too hard
lifting heavy objects the wrong way
vibration from driving or operating machinery
being inactive or overweight"
To help prevent a slipped disc,"Do
keep active – take regular exercise
use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects
Don’t
do not smoke – nicotine weakens the disc tissue"
How to treat and prevent smelly feet yourself,"Always keep your feet clean and dry, including between your toes.
Do
wash your feet at least once a day (use an antibacterial soap if you can)
remove hard skin with a foot file and keep toenails short and clean
use foot powder or an antiperspirant
wear breathable or natural fabrics on your feet, like cotton or leather
let shoes dry out before wearing them again
Don’t
do not wear the same socks or shoes 2 days in a row
do not wear tight shoes
do not walk around barefoot in public or communal places that are wet, like swimming pools and showers in gyms
A pharmacist can help with smelly feet
You can ask a pharmacist about:
antibacterial soaps, powders, and creams
special foot deodorant
medicated insoles for your shoes
antibacterial socks
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of smelly feet,"The main causes of smelly feet are a build-up of sweat and bacteria on them and fungal infections like athlete's foot.
The amount you sweat can be affected by:
hot weather
exercise
standing all day
being overweight
hormonal changes, which happen during puberty, menopause and pregnancy
some medicines, such as antidepressants
a condition that causes excessive sweating called hyperhidrosis"
Medical treatments for smelly feet,"Treatment for smelly feet depends on the cause.
If your smelly feet are caused by a fungal infection, a GP might prescribe a stronger antifungal treatment to clear it up.
If the cause is sweating, they might suggest a stronger antiperspirant or treatment to reduce sweating.
A treatment called iontophoresis may help with sweating, which involves passing a weak electrical current through the affected areas.
A GP might also suggest you see a foot specialist (podiatrist) if your footcare problems do not clear up quickly.
Find a podiatrist"
Common causes of smelly pee,"Pee is usually clear or pale yellow, with a mild smell.
Things that can often make your pee smell stronger include:
certain types of food and drink, like asparagus or coffee
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration)
some medicines
vitamin B6 supplements
If you have other symptoms such as pain when peeing, peeing more often than usual and pee that looks cloudy, you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI).
Less often, smelly pee can be caused by other conditions such as type 2 diabetes or kidney stones."
Things you can do if you have smelly pee,"There are some things you can do to help keep your pee clear and smelling mild.
Do
drink plenty of fluids, particularly water, so that you pee regularly during the day and do not feel thirsty
drink more in hot weather and when exercising
Don’t
do not drink a lot of sugary fizzy drinks, coffee or alcohol
do not eat a lot of garlic or asparagus – they contain strong-smelling chemicals that can pass into your pee
do not take more than 10mg of vitamin B6 a day"
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),"The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine.
NRT is a medicine that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke.
It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking.
Where to get it and how to use it
NRT can be bought from pharmacies and some shops. It's also available on prescription from a doctor or NHS stop smoking service.
It's available as:
skin patches
chewing gum
inhalators (which look like plastic cigarettes)
tablets, oral strips and lozenges
nasal and mouth spray
Patches release nicotine slowly. Some are worn all the time and some should be taken off at night. Inhalators, gum and sprays act more quickly and may be better for helping with cravings.
There's no evidence that any single type of NRT is more effective than another. But there is good evidence to show that using a combination of NRT is more effective than using a single product.
Often the best way to use NRT is to combine a patch with a faster acting form such as gum, inhalator or nasal spray.
Treatment with NRT usually lasts 8-12 weeks, before you gradually reduce the dose and eventually stop.
Who can use it
Most people are able to use NRT, including:
adults and children over 12 years of age – although children under 18 should not use the lozenges without getting medical advice first
pregnant women – your doctor may suggest NRT if they think it would help you quit; read more about stopping smoking in pregnancy
breastfeeding women – your doctor can advise you how to do this safely
Always read the packet or leaflet before using NRT to check whether it's suitable for you.
Sometimes it may be advisable to get medical advice first, for example if you have kidney or liver problems, or you've recently had a heart attack or stroke.
Possible side effects
Side effects of NRT can include:
skin irritation when using patches
irritation of nose, throat or eyes when using a nasal spray
difficulty sleeping (insomnia), sometimes with vivid dreams
an upset stomach
dizziness
headaches
Any side effects are usually mild. But if they're particularly troublesome, contact your GP as the dose or type of NRT may need to be changed."
Varenicline (Champix),"Varenicline (brand name Champix) is not currently available. It has been withdrawn as a precaution because of an impurity found in the medicine. It's not yet known whether it will be available again in future.
Varenicline is a medicine that works in 2 ways. It reduces cravings for nicotine like NRT, but it also blocks the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking. It was only available on prescription.
Speak to your GP or NHS stop smoking adviser who will be able to recommend an alternative treatment."
Bupropion (Zyban),"Bupropion (brand name Zyban) is a medicine originally used to treat depression, but it has since been found to help people quit smoking.
It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's thought to have an effect on the parts of the brain involved in addictive behaviour.
Where to get it and how to use it
Bupropion is only available on prescription, so you'll usually need to see your GP or contact an NHS stop smoking service to get it.
It's taken as 1 to 2 tablets a day. You should start taking it a week or 2 before you try to quit.
A course of treatment usually lasts around 7 to 9 weeks.
Who can take it
Most people can take bupropion, but there are some situations when it's not recommended. For example, it's not suitable if you:
are under 18 years old
are pregnant or breastfeeding
have epilepsy, bipolar disorder or an eating disorder
Possible side effects
Side effects of bupropion can include:
dry mouth
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
headaches
feeling and being sick
constipation
difficulty concentrating
dizziness
Speak to your GP if you have any problems with side effects.
Serotonin syndrome
Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to some medicines. It happens when the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain become too high.
There's a risk of serotonin syndrome if you take more than your prescribed dose of bupropion, or if you take certain other medicines with bupropion such as:
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
Contact your GP or NHS 111 if you have any symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including:
feeling or being sick
diarrhoea
increased heart rate
feeling agitated
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online."
E-cigarettes,"An e-cigarette is an electronic device that delivers nicotine in a vapour. This allows you to inhale nicotine without most of the harmful effects of smoking, as the vapour contains no tar or carbon monoxide.
Research has found that e-cigarettes can help you give up smoking, so you may want to try them rather than the medicines listed above. As with other approaches, they're most effective if used with support from an NHS stop smoking service.
There are no e-cigarettes currently available on prescription.
For now, if you want to use an e-cigarette to help you quit, you'll have to buy one. Costs of e-cigarettes can vary, but generally they're much cheaper than cigarettes.

What to do while you're waiting for help,"If you've been bitten by a snake, there are things you can do while you're waiting for medical help.
Do
stay calm – most snake bites in the UK are not serious and can be treated
keep the part of your body that was bitten as still as you can
lie in the recovery position if you can
take paracetamol for any pain
try to remember the colour and pattern of the snake to tell the doctor
take off any jewellery and loosen clothes near the bite, in case the skin swells
Don’t
do not go near the snake, or try to catch or kill it
do not try to suck or cut the poison (venom) out of the bite
do not tie anything tightly round the part of the body where the bite is
do not take aspirin or ibuprofen, as they can make bleeding worse"
What happens at the hospital,"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for at least 24 hours if you've been bitten by a snake.
The bite will be cleaned and bandaged. You may be given an injection to help protect you from tetanus.
If you were bitten by a poisonous (venomous) snake you'll be treated with a medicine to fight the venom. This is given through a thin tube into a vein, called a drip."
Types of UK snake,"Only 3 types of snake are found in the wild in the UK.
The adder is the only poisonous (venomous) snake, but you should get all snake bites checked as soon as possible.
Telling the doctors the colour and pattern of the snake that bit you could help them treat it.
Adders are grey or reddish-brown, with a dark zig-zag shaped stripe down their back.
Credit:
Grass snakes are usually green, with dark spots down their sides, and yellow and black bands around their neck.
Credit:
Smooth snakes are usually grey or brown with a dark pattern. The patterns down their backs are lighter and less zig-zag shaped than on adders.

Things you can do to help you stop snoring,"Simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce snoring.
Do
try to lose weight if you're overweight
sleep on your side – try taping or stitching a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear, or buy a special pillow or bed wedge to help keep you on your side
consider asking your partner to use earplugs if your snoring affects their sleep
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol
do not take sleeping pills – these can sometimes cause snoring"
What happens at your appointment,"If you snore, the GP will look inside your mouth and nose to check for any problems that might be causing it.
It can help to bring someone with you to your appointment who can describe what your snoring is like, such as a partner.
The GP may do a blood test or refer you to a specialist for treatment or further tests if they're not sure what the cause is."
Treatment for snoring depends on the cause,"Talk to a doctor about the best snoring treatment for you.
Causes and treatments for snoring
Possible cause Treatments
Tongue partially blocking the back of your throat
A device you wear in your mouth to bring your tongue forward (mandibular advancement device)
Mouth falling open when you're asleep
A chin strap to hold your mouth closed, or a device you wear in your mouth to make you breathe through your nose while you sleep (vestibular shield)
Blocked or narrow airways in your nose
Special devices (nasal dilators) or strips that hold your nose open while you sleep, or decongestants or nasal sprays to reduce swelling inside your nose
Surgery for snoring
Surgery is sometimes used to treat snoring if other treatments do not help.
But it's not widely available on the NHS, it does not always work and snoring can come back afterwards."
Causes of snoring,"Snoring is caused by things such as your tongue, mouth, throat or airways in your nose vibrating as you breathe.
It happens because these parts of your body relax and narrow when you're asleep.
You're more likely to snore if you:
are overweight
smoke
drink too much alcohol
sleep on your back
Sometimes it's caused by a condition like sleep apnoea, which is when your airways become temporarily blocked as you sleep."
Symptoms of social anxiety,"Social anxiety is more than shyness. It's a fear that does not go away and affects everyday activities, self confidence, relationships and work or school life.
Many people occasionally worry about social situations, but someone with social anxiety feels overly worried before, during and after them.
You may have social anxiety if you:
worry about everyday activities, such as meeting strangers, starting conversations, speaking on the phone, working or shopping
avoid or worry a lot about social activities, such as group conversations, eating with company and parties
always worry about doing something you think is embarrassing, such as blushing, sweating or appearing incompetent
find it difficult to do things when others are watching – you may feel like you're being watched and judged all the time
fear being criticised, avoid eye contact or have low self-esteem
often have symptoms like feeling sick, sweating, trembling or a pounding heartbeat (palpitations)
have panic attacks, where you have an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety, usually only for a few minutes
Many people with social anxiety also have other mental health issues, such as depression, generalised anxiety disorder or panic disorder."
When to get help for social anxiety,"It's a good idea to see a GP if you think you have social anxiety, especially if it's having a big impact on your life.
It's a common problem and there are treatments that can help.
Asking for help can be difficult, but a GP will be aware that many people struggle with social anxiety and will try to put you at ease.
They'll ask you about your feelings, behaviours and symptoms to find out about your anxiety in social situations.
If they think you could have social anxiety, you'll be referred to a mental health specialist to have a full assessment and talk about treatments.
You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
Find an NHS talking therapies service"
Things you can try to overcome social anxiety,"Self-help can help reduce social anxiety and you might find it a useful first step before trying other treatments.
The following tips may help:
try to understand more about your anxiety – by thinking about or writing down what goes through your mind and how you behave in certain social situations, it can help to keep a diary
try some relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises for stress
break down challenging situations into smaller parts and work on feeling more relaxed with each part
try to focus on what people are saying rather than just assuming the worst"
Treatments for social anxiety,"A number of treatments are available for social anxiety.
The main options are:
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a therapist, which is therapy that helps you identify negative thought patterns and behaviours, and change them; this can be done with just you and a therapist, in a group or with your parents or carers
guided self-help, which involves working through a CBT-based workbook or online course with regular support from a therapist
antidepressant medicines, usually a type of medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as escitalopram or sertraline; these are usually not used to treat children and young people
CBT is generally considered the best treatment, but other treatments may help if it does not work or you do not want to try it.
Some people need to try a combination of treatments."
Support groups,"There are several charities, support groups and online forums for people with social anxiety and other anxiety disorders, including:
Anxiety UK
a HealthUnlocked anxiety forum run by Anxiety Support
Mind and YoungMinds
Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK)"
Social anxiety in children,"Social anxiety can also affect children.
Signs of social anxiety in a child include:
crying or getting upset more often than usual
getting angry a lot
avoiding interaction with other children and adults
fear of going to school or taking part in classroom activities, school performances and social events
not asking for help at school
being very reliant on their parents or carer
Speak to a GP if you're worried about your child. They'll ask you about your child's behaviour and talk to them about how they feel.
Treatments for social anxiety in children are similar to those for teenagers and adults, although medicines are not normally used.
Therapy will be tailored to your child's age and will often involve help from you.
You may be given training and self-help materials to use between sessions. It may also take place in a small group."
Symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas,"Soft tissue sarcomas often have no obvious symptoms in the early stages.
They can cause symptoms as they get bigger or spread. The symptoms depend on where the cancer develops.
For example:
swelling under the skin may cause a painless lump that cannot easily be moved around and gets bigger over time
swelling in the tummy (abdomen) may cause abdominal pain, a persistent feeling of fullness and constipation
swelling near the lungs may cause a cough or breathlessness
You should see a GP if you have a lump – particularly one that's getting bigger over time.
Although it's much more likely you have a non-cancerous condition, such as a cyst (fluid under the skin) or lipoma (fatty lump), it's important to have your symptoms checked."
Types of soft tissue sarcoma,"There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body it develops.
Examples include:
leiomyosarcoma – develops in muscle tissue
liposarcoma – develops in fat tissue
angiosarcoma – develops in the cells of the blood or lymph glands
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) – develop in the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system"
Causes of soft tissue sarcomas,"In most cases there are no obvious reasons why a soft tissue sarcoma develops, but there are a number of things known to increase the risk, including:
age – soft tissue sarcomas can happen at any age, including in children, but they're more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older
certain genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas
previous radiotherapy – some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years later
exposure to certain chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcoma
Kaposi's sarcoma is a very rare sarcoma caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV)."
Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas,"If your GP feels there's a possibility you have soft tissue sarcoma, they'll refer you for a number of tests.
A diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of:
scans – an ultrasound scan is usually the first test done and is fairly simple and quick. Further scans, such as an MRI scan, may be done later
a biopsy – where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed, using a needle or during an operation, so it can be analysed in a laboratory
If a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these and further tests will also help determine how likely the cancer is to spread (known as the ""grade""), and whether or how far the cancer has spread (known as the ""stage"")."
Treatments for soft tissue sarcomas,"People with a soft tissue sarcoma are cared for by a team of doctors and nurses at specialist centres who will help to plan the most appropriate treatment.
The best treatment depends on things such as where the cancer developed, the type of sarcoma it is, how far it has spread, your age and your general health.
The main treatments are:
surgery to remove any tumour
radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy and other medicines to kill the cancer cells
Surgery
Surgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are diagnosed at an early stage.
It usually involves removing the tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This helps to ensure no cancer cells are left behind.
Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and function of the affected body part. But there is a chance you'll have some difficulty using the affected body part after surgery and sometimes further surgery may be needed to repair it.
In a very small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.
Radiotherapy
In some sarcomas, radiotherapy is used before or after surgery to improve the chance of cure. This is done using a machine that directs beams of radiation at a small treatment area.
Radiotherapy alone may also sometimes be used when surgery is not possible, to reduce symptoms caused by the sarcoma or slow its progression.
Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is very occasionally used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given cancer-killing medicine directly into a vein (intravenously).
Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that can't be surgically removed.
Common side effects of chemotherapy include feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss. These can be unpleasant but are usually temporary.
There are also other types of anti-cancer medicines used to treat sarcoma that may be given as injections or tablets."
Outlook for soft tissue sarcomas,"The outlook for a soft tissue sarcoma mostly depends on the type of sarcoma it is, how likely it is to spread (the grade) and how far it has already spread (the stage) by the time it's diagnosed.
If it's detected at an early stage or is a low-grade tumour and it can be removed during surgery, a cure is usually possible. However, larger, high-grade tumours have a greater risk of coming back or spreading.
After initial treatment, you'll need regular check-ups to look for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery.
A cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms.

Causes of soiling,"You may feel angry or frustrated when your child keeps pooing their pants (soiling). But they are not doing it on purpose and may not even realise it's happening.
Soiling usually happens when a child is so constipated that a large, hard piece of poo becomes stuck at the end of their gut (rectum).
Fresh poo from higher up the gut then runs around the hard poo and leaks out, staining their pants.
Signs your child is badly constipated"
Treatment for soiling from a GP,"If your child is pooing their pants (soiling) because they're constipated, a GP can prescribe laxatives to clear out the hard poo and get your child pooing regularly and comfortably again.
This can take a few months to work. The GP will want to see your child regularly to check how they are doing.
The soiling may get worse before it gets better.
A GP may refer your child to a specialist for treatment if they think soiling could be caused by another medical condition."
Things you can do at home to help with soiling,"If your child is regularly pooing their pants (soiling), it can help to:
set up a regular toilet routine for your child – for example, they could sit on the toilet for 5 minutes every day after each meal and before going to bed
be positive and encouraging – you could use a star chart to reward your child for sitting on the toilet (whether or not they do a poo), or leave some toys or books next to the toilet
encourage your child to go to the toilet as soon as they get the urge to during the day
make sure your child is drinking plenty of fluids and has enough fibre in their diet
encourage your child to be physically active"
Things you can do if you have a sore or white tongue,"Do
use a soft toothbrush to brush your teeth
brush your tongue or use a scraper to help improve a white tongue
use a straw to drink cool drinks
take paracetamol or ibuprofen
Don’t
do not use a toothpaste that contains sodium lauryl sulphate
do not eat spicy, acidic or hot food and drink that may irritate your tongue
do not smoke
do not drink alcohol
A pharmacist can help with a sore or white tongue
You can ask a pharmacist:
what's causing your sore or white tongue
if you can buy anything to help with any pain or irritation
if you should see a dentist or GP
Find a pharmacy"
Common causes of a sore or white tongue,"Biting or burning your tongue with hot food or drink can cause pain and swelling. This should only last a few days.
A white tongue can be a sign of a health condition, such as anaemia, scarlet fever, lichen planus, leukoplakia, geographic tongue, mouth ulcers or oral thrush.
But do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.

How to treat a sore throat yourself,"To help soothe a sore throat and shorten how long it lasts, you can:
gargle with warm, salty water (children should not try this)
drink plenty of water
eat cool or soft foods
avoid smoking or smoky places
suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets – but do not give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking

A pharmacist can help with sore throats,"You can ask a pharmacist about ways of relieving the pain and discomfort of a sore throat, such as:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
medicated lozenges containing a local anaesthetic, antiseptic, or anti-inflammatory medicine
anaesthetic spray (although there's little proof they help)
You can buy these treatments from a supermarket or from a pharmacy without a prescription.
A pharmacist can also provide other treatments if you need them, without you seeing a GP.
Some medicines are not safe for everyone (for example, if you're pregnant). Always check the leaflet or speak to a pharmacist before taking them.

Antibiotics
You do not normally need antibiotics for a sore throat because they will not usually relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
You'll only be given antibiotics if you could have a bacterial infection."
Sore throat symptoms,"If you have a sore throat you might have:
a painful throat, especially when swallowing
a dry, scratchy throat
redness in the back of your mouth
bad breath
a mild cough
swollen neck glands
The symptoms are similar for children, but children can also get a temperature and appear less active."
Causes of sore throats,"Sore throats are usually caused by viruses (like cold or flu) or from smoking. Very occasionally they can be caused by bacteria.
A sore throat can also be caused by:
laryngitis
tonsillitis
strep throat (a bacterial throat infection)
glandular fever"
Types of spina bifida,"There are several different types of spina bifida, including:
myelomeningocele – the most severe type of spina bifida; the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the back, allowing the spinal cord and protective membranes around it to push out and form a sac in the baby's back
meningocele – another serious type of spina bifida where the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the spine; the spinal cord usually develops normally so surgery can often be used to remove the membranes without damaging the nerves
spina bifida occulta – the most common and mildest type of spina bifida; 1 or more vertebrae does not form properly, but the gap in the spine is very small; spina bifida occulta does not usually cause any problems and most people are unaware they have it
These pages focus on myelomeningocele, the most severe type of spina bifida, and this is the type usually referred to whenever the term spina bifida is used.
Shine is a charity that provides help and support for people affected by spina bifida. 
Their website has more information about the other types of spina bifida."
Symptoms of spina bifida,"Most people with spina bifida are able to have surgery to close the opening in the spine.
But the nervous system will usually already have been damaged, which can lead to problems such as:
weakness or total paralysis of the legs
bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence
loss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom – the child is unable to feel hot or cold, which can lead to accidental injury
Many babies will have or develop hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain.
Most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, but some have learning difficulties.
Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida."
Causes of spina bifida,"The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but a number of factors can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition.
These include: 
low folic acid intake during pregnancy
having a family history of spina bifida
medicines – taking certain medicines such as valproic acid (used to prevent seizures) during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida
Read more about the causes of spina bifida."
Diagnosing spina bifida,"Spina bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy.
If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you.
This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice.
Tests after birth
Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option.
Tests may include:
monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan, to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)
ultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally
an assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis
Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born."
Treating spina bifida,"Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include:
surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus
therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy
assistive devices and mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, or walking aids
treatments for bowel and urinary problems
With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood.
It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives.
Read more about treating spina bifida."
Preventing spina bifida with folic acid,"The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy.
Folic acid recommendations
You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant.
If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant.
Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you.
You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas.
Read more about folic acid, including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate.
Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida
Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP.
Women at higher risk include those:
with a family history of neural tube defects
with a partner with a family history of neural tube defects
who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect
with diabetes
A GP can advise you further about this.
If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy, you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid."
Help and support,"If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it.
Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations.
You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website."

The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of SMA,"The symptoms of SMA and when they first appear depend on the type of SMA you have.
Typical symptoms include:
floppy or weak arms and legs
movement problems – such as difficulty sitting up, crawling or walking
twitching or shaking muscles (tremors)
bone and joint problems – such as an unusually curved spine (scoliosis)
swallowing problems
breathing difficulties
SMA does not affect intelligence or cause learning disabilities."
Types of SMA,"There are several types of SMA, which start at different ages. Some types cause more serious problems than others.
The main types are:
type 1 – develops in babies less than 6 months old and is the most severe type
type 2 – appears in babies who are 7 to 18 months old and is less severe than type 1
type 3 – develops after 18 months of age and is the least severe type affecting children
type 4 – affects adults and usually only causes mild problems
In the past, babies with type 1 rarely survived beyond the first few years of life. But in recent years outcomes have improved with early diagnosis and treatment.
Most children with type 2 survive into adulthood and can live long, fulfilling lives. Types 3 and 4 do not usually affect life expectancy.
Read more about the types of SMA."
Treatments for SMA,"It's not currently possible to cure SMA, but research is ongoing to find possible new treatments.
Treatment and support is available to manage the symptoms and help people with SMA have the best possible quality of life.
Treatment may involve:
exercises and equipment to help with movement and breathing
feeding tubes and dietary advice
braces or surgery to treat problems with the spine or joints
medicines that target the faulty genes that cause the condition
A range of healthcare professionals may be involved in your care, including specialist doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists.
Read more about treatments for SMA."
Tests for SMA,"The genetic problem that causes SMA is passed on to a child by their parents.
Speak to a GP if you're planning a pregnancy and:
you've had a child with SMA before
you have a history of the condition in your family
your partner has a history of the condition in their family
The GP may refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss the risk of the condition affecting a future pregnancy and any tsts you can have.
If you're pregnant and there's a chance your baby could have SMA, tests can be carried out to check if they'll be born with the condition. 
Tests can also be done after birth to diagnose SMA in children and adults.
Read more about tests for SMA."
How SMA is inherited,"In most cases, a child can only be born with SMA if both of their parents have a faulty gene that causes the condition.
The parents will not usually have SMA themselves, which is known as being a carrier. Around 1 in every 40 to 60 people is a carrier of the main faulty gene that causes SMA.
If 2 parents who are carriers have a baby, there's a:
1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will have SMA
1 in 2 (50%) chance their child will be a carrier of the faulty gene, but will not have SMA
1 in 4 (25%) chance their child will not have SMA and will not be a carrier
Some rarer types of SMA are inherited in a slightly different way, or may not be passed on at all.
Speak to a doctor if you or your partner has a family history of SMA and you're worried your children might get it.
Read more about how SMA is inherited on the Spinal Muscular Atrophy UK website"

Why spirometry is carried out,"Spirometry can be used to help diagnose a lung condition if you have symptoms, or if your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing a particular lung condition.
For example, spirometry may be recommended if you have a persistent cough or breathlessness, or if you're over 35 and smoke.
Conditions that can be picked up and monitored using spirometry include:
asthma – a long-term condition where the airways become periodically inflamed (swollen) and narrowed
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a group of lung conditions where the airways become narrowed
cystic fibrosis – a genetic condition where the lungs and digestive system become clogged with thick, sticky mucus
pulmonary fibrosis – scarring of the lungs
If you've already been diagnosed with 1 of these conditions, spirometry may be carried out to check the severity of the condition or see how you're responding to treatment.
Spirometry is also a standard test for people being considered for surgery, or to check the general health of people who have other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis."
Preparing for the test,"You'll be told about anything you need to do to prepare for the test.
If you use bronchodilators (medicines, usually inhaled, that help relax and widen your airways), you may need to stop using it beforehand.
You should also avoid smoking for 24 hours before the test, and avoid drinking alcohol, strenuous exercise or eating large meals for a few hours beforehand.
It's best to wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of the test."
What happens during a spirometry test,"You'll be seated during the test and a soft clip will be placed on your nose to stop air escaping from it.
The tester will explain what you need to do, and you may be asked to have a few practise attempts first.
During spirometry, you’ll be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a small tube (spirometer).
Credit:
When you're ready for the test, you'll be asked to:
inhale fully, so your lungs are completely filled with air
close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece
exhale as quickly and forcefully as you can, making sure you empty your lungs fully
This will normally need to be repeated at least 3 times to ensure a reliable result.
Sometimes, the test may need to be repeated around 15 minutes after taking some inhaled bronchodilator medicine.
This can show if you have a lung condition that responds to these medicines.
Overall, your appointment should last around 30 to 90 minutes. You'll be able to go home soon after the tests have finished and return to your normal activities."
Your results,"The person carrying out the test won't usually be able to give you your results immediately.
The results will need to be looked at by a specialist first and will then be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test, who will discuss them with you a few days later.
A spirometer measures the amount of air you can breathe out in one second and the total volume of air you can exhale in one forced breath.
These measurements will be compared with a normal result for someone of your age, height and sex, which will help show if your lungs aren't working properly.
The measurements will also show whether any problem with your lungs is ""obstructive"", ""restrictive"", or a combination of the two:
obstructive airways disease – where your ability to breathe out quickly is affected by narrowing of the airways, but the amount of air you can hold in your lungs is normal (such as in asthma or COPD)
restrictive lung disease – where the amount of air you can breathe in is reduced because your lungs are unable to fully expand (such as in pulmonary fibrosis)."
Risks and side effects,"Spirometry is a straightforward test and is generally considered very safe. Some people may feel dizzy, faint, shaky, sick or tired for a short period afterwards.
Most people are able to have a spirometry test safely. But the test increases the pressure inside your head, chest, stomach and eyes as you breathe out, so it may need to be delayed or avoided if you have a condition that could be made worse by this.
For example, spirometry may not be safe if you have, or have recently had, unstable angina, a heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or an operation to your head, chest, stomach or eyes."
What does the spleen do?,"The spleen has some important functions:
it fights invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells)
it controls the level of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets)
it filters the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells"
Spleen problems,"The spleen is not working properly
If the spleen does not work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells.
This can lead to:
anaemia, from a reduced number of red blood cells
an increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells
bleeding or bruising, caused by a reduced number of platelets
A painful spleen
Spleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area. 
This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.
A damaged or ruptured spleen
The spleen can become damaged or may burst (rupture) after an injury, such as a blow to the abdomen, a car accident, a sporting accident or broken ribs. 
Rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.
Signs of a ruptured spleen are:
pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area
dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)
A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding.
Go straight to A&E if you think you have ruptured or damaged your spleen.
An enlarged spleen
The spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a health condition, such as cirrhosis, leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis.
An enlarged spleen does not always cause symptoms.
Otherwise, look out for:
feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach)
feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs
anaemia and fatigue
frequent infections
easy bleeding
Doctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan can confirm the diagnosis.
The spleen is not usually removed if it's just enlarged. Instead, you'll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. You may be prescribed antibiotics if there's an infection.
You'll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you'll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it's enlarged."
Surgery to remove the spleen,"You may need an operation to remove your spleen, known as a splenectomy, if it's not working properly or it's damaged, diseased or enlarged.
Sometimes just part of your spleen can be removed, which is called a partial splenectomy.
If there's time, you'll be advised to have certain vaccinations before the operation. This is because spleen removal weakens your immune system and can make you more likely to get an infection.
Laparoscopy
Most operations to remove spleens are carried out using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy).
Keyhole spleen removal allows a surgeon to get inside your tummy (abdomen) to your spleen without having to make large cuts.
This means you'll have less scarring and may recover from the operation more quickly. But you'll still need a general anaesthetic.
The procedure involves:
making several small cuts in your tummy
guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the cuts so doctors can see what they're doing
passing thin instruments into your tummy through the other cuts to remove your spleen (gas will be pumped into your tummy to make this easier)
The cuts are then stitched up or sometimes glued together. 
You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay in hospital overnight.
If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.
Open surgery
Open surgery is where one large cut is made. It may be needed if your spleen cannot be removed using keyhole surgery. Often, in emergencies, this is the preferred method.
You'll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover.
Recovering from spleen surgery
It's normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you'll be given pain relief.
You should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation.
Like any operation, spleen removal carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection.
Your doctor will talk through these risks with you.
You should be given breathing and leg exercises to do at home to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection. In some cases you may also be given blood thinning injections for around 1 to 2 weeks after your surgery.
Another risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection such as a high temperature or redness and swelling around the wound, contact your GP or hospital immediately. You may need antibiotics.
Recovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving."
Living without a spleen,"If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs, such as the liver, can take over many of the spleen's functions. 
This means you'll still be able to cope with most infections. But there's a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly. This risk will be present for the rest of your life.
Young children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small.
The risk is also increased if you have a health condition like sickle cell anaemia or coeliac disease, or a health condition that affects your immune system, like HIV.
This risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection.
Vaccinations
Check with your GP surgery that you have had all your routine NHS vaccinations.
You should also be vaccinated against:
pneumococcal infections, such as pneumonia, with a booster every 5 years
flu (get the flu vaccine every year)
MenACWY
MenB
Antibiotics
It's recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for at least 2 years, and in many cases, the rest of your life, to prevent bacterial infections.
Antibiotics are particularly important:
for children and young people under the age of 18
for adults over the age of 50
for the first 2 years after your spleen is removed
if your immune system does not work properly
Be alert for signs of infection
See a GP as soon as possible if you get signs of an infection.
Signs of infection include:
a high temperature
a sore throat
a cough
a severe headache
a headache with drowsiness or a rash
abdominal pain
redness and swelling around the surgical wound
Your GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics so you have them ready to use if you get an infection.
If your infection becomes serious, you may be admitted to hospital.
Beware of animal and tick bites
Bites from animals and small blood-sucking parasites called ticks can cause infections.
If you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics if you have them with you, and seek medical advice urgently.
If you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of Lyme disease, a disease transmitted by ticks.
Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers.
If you become ill, get medical advice straight away.
Tell medical staff about your spleen problems
Healthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you do not have a working spleen.
But always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist.
Carry medical ID
It's a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID.
For example:
if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you
you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant
If you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert staff to your condition.
Travel advice
If you're travelling abroad:
you may be advised to take a course of antibiotics with you
check if you need any travel vaccinations
People without a working spleen have an increased risk of developing a severe form of malaria.
If possible, avoid countries where malaria is present. If you cannot avoid them, speak to a GP or local pharmacist about antimalarial medicine before you travel.
You should also use mosquito nets and insect repellent."
Check if you have spondylolisthesis,"The main symptoms of spondylolisthesis include:
pain in your lower back, often worse when standing or walking and relieved when sitting or bending forward
pain spreading to your bottom or thighs
tight hamstrings (the muscles in the back of your thighs)
pain, numbness or tingling spreading from your lower back down 1 leg (sciatica)
Spondylolisthesis does not always cause symptoms."
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you have symptoms of spondylolisthesis, the GP may examine your back.
They may also ask you to lie down and raise 1 leg straight up in the air. This is painful if you have tight hamstrings or sciatica caused by spondylolisthesis.
The GP may arrange an X-ray to see if a bone in your spine has slipped forward.
You may have other scans, such as an MRI scan, if you have pain, numbness or weakness in your legs."
Treatments for spondylolisthesis,"Treatments for spondylolisthesis depend on the symptoms you have and how severe they are.
Common treatments include:
avoiding activities that make symptoms worse, such as bending, lifting, athletics and gymnastics
taking anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen or stronger painkillers on prescription
steroid injections in your back to relieve pain, numbness and tingling in your leg
physiotherapy to strengthen and stretch the muscles in your lower back, tummy and legs
The GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, or you can refer yourself in some areas.
Waiting times for physiotherapy on the NHS can be long. You can also get it privately.
Find a physiotherapist on the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website
Surgery for spondylolisthesis
The GP may refer you to a specialist for back surgery if other treatments do not work.
Types of surgery include:
spinal fusion – the slipped bone (vertebra) is joined to the bone below with metal rods, screws and a bone graft
lumbar decompression – a procedure to relieve pressure on the compressed spinal nerves
The operation is done under general anaesthetic, which means you will not be awake.
Recovery from surgery can take several weeks, but if often improves many of the symptoms of spondylolisthesis.
Talk to your surgeon about the risks and benefits of spinal surgery."
Causes of spondylolisthesis,"Spondylolisthesis can:
happen as you get older – the bones of the spine can weaken with age
run in families
be caused by a tiny crack in a bone (stress fracture) – this is more common in athletes and gymnasts"
Check if you have a sprain or strain,"It's likely to be a sprain or strain if:
you have pain, tenderness or weakness – often around your ankle, foot, wrist, thumb, knee, leg or back
the injured area is swollen or bruised
you cannot put weight on the injury or use it normally
you have muscle spasms or cramping – where your muscles painfully tighten on their own"
How to treat sprains and strains yourself,"For the first couple of days, follow the 4 steps known as RICE therapy to help bring down swelling and support the injury:
Rest – stop any exercise or activities and try not to put any weight on the injury.
Ice – apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a tea towel) to the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours.
Compression – wrap a bandage around the injury to support it.
Elevate – keep it raised on a pillow as much as possible.
To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat (such as hot baths and heat packs), alcohol and massages for the first couple of days.
When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint or muscle does not become stiff."
A pharmacist can help with sprains and strains,"Speak to a pharmacist about the best treatment for you. They might suggest tablets, or a cream or gel you rub on the skin.
At first, try painkillers like paracetamol to ease the pain and ibuprofen gel, mousse or spray to bring down swelling.
If needed, you can take ibuprofen tablets, capsules or syrup that you swallow.
Find a pharmacy"
How long it takes for a sprain or strain to heal,"After 2 weeks, most sprains and strains will feel better.
Avoid strenuous exercise such as running for up to 8 weeks, as there's a risk of further damage.
Severe sprains and strains can take months to get back to normal."
You cannot always prevent sprains and strains,"Sprains and strains happen when you overstretch or twist a muscle.
Not warming up before exercising, tired muscles and playing sport are common causes."
Treatments for sprains and strains,"If you need treatment for a sprain or strain you may be given self-care advice or prescribed a stronger painkiller.
You may need an X-ray, which can sometimes be done at an urgent treatment centre, or you may be referred to hospital.
Physiotherapy for sprains and strains
If you have a sprain or strain that's taking longer than usual to get better, a GP may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist.
Physiotherapy from the NHS might not be available everywhere and waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.

When to get medical advice,"Get advice if:
your child has a squint all the time
your child is older than 3 months and has a squint that comes and goes – in babies younger than this, squints that come and go are common and are not usually a cause for concern
you have any concerns about your child's vision – signs of a problem can include regularly turning their head to one side or keeping one eye closed when looking at things
you develop a squint or double vision later in life
A GP, health visitor or local opticians service can refer you to an eye specialist for some simple tests and treatment if necessary."
Treatments and surgery for a squint,"The main treatments for a squint are:
Glasses – these can help if a squint is caused by a problem with your child's eyesight, such as long-sightedness.
Eye exercises – exercises for the muscles that control eye movement may sometimes help the eyes work together better.
Surgery – this involves moving the muscles that control eye movement so the eyes line up correctly. It may be recommended if glasses are not fully effective on their own. Read more about squint surgery.
Injections into the eye muscles – these weaken the eye muscles, which can help the eyes line up better. But the effect usually lasts less than 3 months.
If your child has a lazy eye as a result of their squint it may need to be treated first.
Treatment for a lazy eye usually involves wearing a patch over the unaffected eye to help improve vision in the affected eye."
Problems a child may have if a squint is not treated,"It's important not to ignore a squint that happens all the time or develops after 3 months of age.
It could lead to further problems if left untreated, such as:
persistent blurred or double vision
a lazy eye – where the brain starts to ignore signals coming from the affected eye, so your child does not develop normal eyesight
embarrassment or low self-esteem
Surgery can help improve the alignment of the eyes even if a squint has been left untreated for a long time, but any vision problems may be permanent if they are not treated at a young age."
Causes of squints,"The exact cause of a squint is not always known.
Some people are born with a squint and others develop one later in life. Sometimes they run in families.
In children, a squint is often caused by the eye attempting to overcome a vision problem, such as:
short-sightedness – difficulty seeing things that are far away
long-sightedness – difficulty seeing nearby objects
astigmatism – where the front of the eye is unevenly curved, causing blurred vision
Rarer causes of a squint include:
some infections, such as measles
some genetic conditions or syndromes, such as Down's syndrome
developmental delays
cerebral palsy
other problems with the brain or nerves
A squint can also sometimes be a symptom of a rare type of childhood eye cancer called retinoblastoma. Take your child to see a GP if they have a squint to rule out this condition."
What is stammering?,"Stammering is when:
you repeat sounds or syllables – for example, saying ""mu-mu-mu-mummy""
you make sounds longer – for example, ""mmmmmmummy""
a word gets stuck or does not come out at all
Stammering varies in severity from person to person, and from situation to situation. Someone might have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently.
Find out more about how stammering can affect you."
Types of stammering,"There are 2 main types of stammering:
developmental stammering – the most common type of stammering that happens in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing quickly
acquired or late-onset stammering – is relatively rare and happens in older children and adults as a result of a head injury, stroke or progressive neurological condition. It can also be caused by certain drugs, medicines, or psychological or emotional trauma
The information here focuses on developmental stammering."
What causes stammering?,"It is not possible to say for sure why a child starts stammering, but it is not caused by anything the parents have done.
Developmental and inherited factors may play a part, along with small differences in how efficiently the speech areas of the brain are working.
Speech development
Speech development is a complex process that involves communication between different areas of the brain, and between the brain and the muscles responsible for breathing and speaking.
When every part of this system works well, the right words are spoken in the right order, with correct rhythm, pauses and emphasis.
A child learning to construct simple sentences needs practice to develop the different speech areas in the brain and create the ""wiring"" (neural pathways) needed for the different parts to work well together.
Stammering can happen if some parts of this developing system are not co-ordinated. This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure.
As the brain continues to develop, stammering may resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children stop stammering as they get older.
Sex differences and genes
Stammering is more common in boys than girls. It is unclear why this is.
Genes are also thought to have a role. Around 2 in 3 people who stammer have a family history of stammering, which suggests the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer."
When to get help,"You should get advice if you have any concerns about your child's speech or language development.
Treatment for stammering is often successful in pre-school age children, so it's important to get advice as soon as possible.
Talk to a GP or health visitor about your concerns. If necessary, they may refer your child to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for an assessment.
In many areas, you can phone children's speech and language services directly and refer your child yourself.
Stamma (the British Stammering Association) has more information and support for people who stammer and parents of stammering children. You can call the helpline on 0808 802 0002 from Monday to Friday 10am to midday and 6pm to 8pm to find out about the services available in your area.
If you're an adult who stammers and it's having a significant impact on your social and work life, you may want to ask a GP to refer you to an SLT."
Treatments for stammering,"There are different speech and language therapy approaches that can help people who stammer to speak more easily.
You'll work with a therapist to choose a suitable plan tailored to your child or you.
This may involve:
creating an environment where your child feels more relaxed and confident about talking
strategies to increase fluency and develop communication skills
working on feelings associated with stammering, such as fear and anxiety
Electronic devices to reduce stammering are also available and can help some older children and adults, but they're not usually available on the NHS.
Find out more about treating stammering."
Who's affected,"Studies suggest around 1 in 12 young children go through a phase of stammering.
Around 2 in 3 children who stammer will go on to speak fluently, although it's difficult to predict when this will happen in a particular child.
It's estimated that stammering affects around 1 in 50 adults, with men being around 3 to 4 times more likely to stammer than women."
Check if you have a staph skin infection,Symptoms of a staph skin infection can include:
How staph infections are spread,"The bacteria that cause staph infections live harmlessly on many people's skin, often in the nose and armpits and on the buttocks.
They usually only cause an infection if they get into the skin – for example, through a bite or cut.
Staph bacteria can spread to others through:
close skin contact
sharing things like towels or toothbrushes
droplets in coughs and sneezes (less common)
You cannot always prevent staph infections
It can be difficult to prevent staph infections because many people have the bacteria on their skin.
But there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an infection or spreading the bacteria to others."
Why have I been offered statins?,"Having a high level of LDL cholesterol is potentially dangerous, as it can lead to a hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels. It's a very common cause of death in the UK.
The main types of CVD are:
coronary heart disease – when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted
angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles
heart attacks – when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked
stroke – when the supply of blood to the brain becomes blocked
A doctor may recommend taking statins if either:
you have been diagnosed with a form of CVD
your personal and family medical history suggests you're likely to develop CVD at some point over the next 10 years and lifestyle measures have not reduced this risk
Find out more about when statins may be recommended."
Taking statins,"Statins come as tablets that are taken once a day.
Your dose will depend on why you need the medicine, your cholesterol levels, and other medicines you're taking.
Your GP may increase your statins to the maximum dose. This helps to manage your cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease.
For some types of statin it does not matter what time of day you take it, as long as you stick to the same time.
Some types of statin should be taken in the evening.
Check with your doctor whether there's a particular time of day you should take your statin.
You usually have to continue taking statins for life because if you stop taking them, your cholesterol will return to a high level.
If you forget to take your dose, do not take an extra one to make up for it. Just take your next dose as usual the following day.
If you accidentally take too many statin tablets (more than your usual daily dose), contact a doctor or pharmacist for advice or call NHS 111."
Cautions and interactions,"Statins can sometimes interact with other medicines, increasing the risk of serious side effects, such as muscle damage.
Some types of statin can also interact with grapefruit juice.
It's very important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine to check if there are any interactions you should be aware of.
If in doubt, contact a GP or pharmacist for advice.
Find out more things to consider when taking statins."
Side effects of statins,"Many people who take statins experience no or very few side effects. Others experience some side effects, but these are usually minor, such as diarrhoea, a headache or feeling sick.
Your doctor should discuss the risks and benefits of taking statins if they're offered to you.
The risks of any side effects also have to be balanced against the benefits of preventing serious problems. 
Find out more about the side effects of statins."
Alternatives to statins,"If you're at risk of developing CVD in the near future, your doctor will usually recommend lifestyle changes to reduce this risk before they suggest that you take statins.
Lifestyle changes that can reduce your cholesterol level and CVD risk include:
eating a healthy, balanced diet
exercising regularly
maintaining a healthy weight
limiting the amount of alcohol you drink
stopping smoking
Statins may be recommended if these measures do not help.
Read more about treating high cholesterol and preventing CVD."
Types of statin,"There are 5 types of statin available on prescription in the UK:
atorvastatin (Lipitor)
fluvastatin (Lescol)
pravastatin (Lipostat)
rosuvastatin (Crestor)
simvastatin (Zocor)"
Why are stem cell transplants carried out?,"Stem cell transplants are used to treat conditions in which the bone marrow is damaged and is no longer able to produce healthy blood cells.
Transplants can also be carried out to replace blood cells that are damaged or destroyed as a result of intensive cancer treatment.
Conditions that stem cell transplants can be used to treat include:
severe aplastic anaemia (bone marrow failure)
leukaemia – a type of cancer affecting white blood cells
lymphoma – another type of cancer affecting white blood cells
multiple myeloma – cancer affecting cells called plasma cells
certain blood, immune system and metabolic disorders – including sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Hurler syndrome
A stem cell transplant will usually only be carried out if other treatments have not helped, the potential benefits of a transplant outweigh the risks and you're in relatively good health, despite your underlying condition."
What does a stem cell transplant involve?,"A stem cell transplant can involve taking healthy stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of one person – ideally a close family member with the same or similar tissue type – and transferring them to another person. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
It's also possible to remove stem cells from your own body and transplant them later, after any damaged or diseased cells have been removed. This is called an autologous transplant.
A stem cell transplant has 5 main stages. These are:
Tests and examinations – to assess your general level of health.
Harvesting – the process of collecting the stem cells to be used in the transplant, either from you or a donor.
Conditioning – treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to prepare your body for the transplant.
Transplanting the stem cells.
Recovery – you'll need to stay in hospital for at least a few weeks until the transplant starts to take effect.
Having a stem cell transplant can be an intensive and challenging experience. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for at least a few weeks until the transplant starts to take effect and it can take up to a year or longer to fully recover.
Read more about what happens during a stem cell transplant."
Risks of a stem cell transplant,"Stem cell transplants are complicated procedures with significant risks. It's important that you're aware of both the risks and possible benefits before treatment begins.
Possible problems you can have during or after the transplant process include:
graft versus host disease (GvHD) – this happens in allogeneic transplants when the transplanted cells start to attack the other cells in your body
reduced number of blood cells – this can lead to iron deficiency anaemia, excessive bleeding or bruising, and an increased risk of infections
chemotherapy side effects – including sickness, tiredness, hair loss and infertility
Read more about the risks of having a stem cell transplant."
Stem cell donation,"If it is not possible to use your own stem cells for the transplant, stem cells will need to come from a donor.
To improve the chances of the transplant being successful, donated stem cells need to carry a special genetic marker – known as a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) – that's identical or very similar to that of the person receiving the transplant.
The best chance of getting a match is from a brother or sister, or sometimes another close family member. If there are no matches in your close family, a search of the British Bone Marrow Registry will be carried out.
Most people will eventually find a donor in the registry, although a small number of people may find it very hard or impossible to find a suitable match.
The NHS Blood and Transplant website and the Anthony Nolan website have more information about stem cell and bone marrow donation."
How and when to use a steroid inhaler,"There are several types of steroid inhaler, which are used in slightly different ways.
A doctor or nurse will show you how to use your inhaler. Make sure you use it exactly as advised. Asthma + Lung UK has videos explaining how to use the different types of inhaler.
You'll usually need to take 1 or 2 puffs from your inhaler in the morning and 1 or 2 puffs in the evening.
Some people can use their inhaler once a day once their symptoms are under control. If you use it once a day, you'll usually be advised to use it in the evening.
It's important to keep using your inhaler, even if you feel better. It will only stop your symptoms if it's used every day.
If you miss a dose or take too much
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's nearly time for your next dose, skip the one you missed.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Accidentally taking too many puffs from a steroid inhaler is unlikely to be harmful if it's a one-off. Speak to a doctor, nurse or a pharmacist if you're worried.
Using a steroid inhaler too much over a long period can increase your chances of getting side effects.
Stopping treatment
Do not stop using your inhaler unless you're advised to by a doctor.
When you stop your treatment, you usually need to reduce your dose gradually.
This can help avoid unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms), such as severe tiredness, joint pain, being sick and dizziness."
Side effects of steroid inhalers,"Steroid inhalers usually cause few or no side effects if used correctly and at low doses.
Some people get:
a sore mouth or throat
a hoarse or croaky voice
a cough
oral thrush – a fungal infection that causes white patches, redness and soreness in the mouth
If you're taking a high dose for a long time, there's also a small chance you could get some of the side effects of steroid tablets, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping (insomnia).
Taking high doses for a long time can slow down the normal growth of children and teenagers. Your child's doctor will monitor their height and weight carefully for as long as they're taking steroid medicine. This will help them spot any slowing down of your child's growth and change their treatment if needed.
You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card scheme."
Coping with side effects of steroid inhalers,"The following tips may help reduce the side effects of steroid inhalers:
use your inhaler exactly as you've been shown – speak to a doctor or nurse if you're not sure how to use your inhaler correctly
use your inhaler with a spacer, a hollow plastic tube or container with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole for the inhaler at the other – find out more about spacers from Asthma + Lung UK
rinse your mouth out with water and spit it out or brush your teeth after using your inhaler
If you're taking a high dose for a long period of time, you may be given a blue steroid treatment card that explains how you can reduce the risk of side effects. You may also be given a red steroid emergency card.
If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue or red steroid card to the doctor, dentist or pharmacist so they know that you're using a steroid inhaler."
"Using steroid inhalers with other medicines, food or alcohol","Some medicines can interfere with the way steroid inhalers work, but this is uncommon if you're only taking low doses for a short period.
Tell a doctor if you take any other medicines, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting to use a steroid inhaler.
If you're already using an inhaler, ask a doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicines, remedies or supplements.
You can usually drink alcohol while using a steroid inhaler and you should be able to eat most foods. Do not smoke though, as this can make your medicine less effective and make your symptoms worse."
Who can use steroid inhalers,"Most people can use steroid inhalers.
Tell your doctor before starting treatment if you:
have had an allergic reaction to steroids in the past
have tuberculosis (TB) or another infection of your lungs or airways
are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby
Steroid inhalers are normally safe to use while breastfeeding and during pregnancy, but it's a good idea to get medical advice first.
If you need to take a high dose during pregnancy, you may need regular check-ups to check for any side effects."
How steroid inhalers work,"Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When they're inhaled, steroids reduce swelling (inflammation) in your airways.
This can help reduce symptoms of asthma and COPD, such as wheezing and shortness of breath.
Steroid inhalers are different to the anabolic steroids that some people use illegally to increase their muscle mass."
How steroid injections are given,"Steroid injections are given by a healthcare professional in a hospital, clinic or GP surgery.
They can be given in several different ways, including:
into a joint (an intra-articular injection)
into a muscle (an intramuscular injection)
into the spine (an epidural injection)
into the blood (an intravenous injection)
The injections normally take a few days to start working, although some work in a few hours. The effect usually wears off after a few weeks or months.
If you're having an injection to relieve pain, it may also contain local anaesthetic. This provides immediate pain relief that lasts up to a few hours.
You should be able to go home soon after the injection. You may need to rest the treated body part for a few days."
Side effects of steroid injections,"Possible side effects of steroid injections depend on where the injection is given.
Side effects of injections into the joints, muscles or spine can include:
pain and discomfort for a few days – paracetamol may help with this
temporary bruising or a collection of blood under the skin
flushing of the face for a few hours
changes to your vision such as blurred vision – speak to your specialist if this happens
an infection, causing redness, swelling and pain – get medical advice as soon as possible if you have these symptoms
a loss of fat where the injection was given – this can cause dimples in the skin and may be permanent
paler skin around the site of the injection – this may be permanent
If you have diabetes, your blood sugar level may go up for a few days.
If you have high blood pressure, your blood pressure may go up for a few days.
Epidural injections can also occasionally give you a very painful headache that's only relieved by lying down. This should get better on its own, but tell your specialist if you get it.
Side effects of injections given into the blood tend to be similar to side effects of steroid tablets, such as increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping (insomnia).
If you're having steroid injections for more than a few weeks, or you're prescribed a high dose, you may be given a blue steroid treatment card that explains how you can reduce the risk of side effects. You may also be given a red steroid emergency card.
If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue or red steroid card to the doctor, dentist or pharmacist so they know that you're having steroid injections.
You can report any suspected side effect to Yellow Card, the UK safety scheme."
Who can have steroid injections,"Most people can have steroid injections.
Tell the doctor before having treatment if you:
have had a steroid injection in the last few weeks – you usually need to wait at least 3 months between injections
have had 4 steroid injections in the last year – doctors usually recommend no more than 4 injections in the same area in the space of 12 months
have had an allergic reaction to steroids in the past
have an infection (including eye infections)
have recently had, or are about to have, any vaccinations
are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby
have any other conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, high blood pressure, or problems with your liver, heart or kidneys
are taking other medicines, such as anticoagulants
Steroid injections may not always be suitable in these cases, although the doctor may recommend them if they think the benefits outweigh any risks."
How steroid injections work,"Steroids closely copy the effects of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When injected into a joint or muscle, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation) in the nearby area. This can help relieve pain and stiffness.
When injected into the blood, they can reduce inflammation throughout the body, as well as reduce the activity of the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
Steroid injections are different from the anabolic steroids used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass."
How and when to use steroid nasal sprays,"Steroid nasal sprays can be used as a long-term treatment or just when they're needed.
For hay fever, it's best to use them from 1 to 2 weeks before you think your symptoms will start, as they can take a few days to work.
The leaflet that comes with your spray should explain how to use it and how often. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you're not sure.
It's important to use your spray regularly, even if you're feeling better. It will only help if it's used every day.
If you miss a dose or take too much
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's nearly time for your next dose, skip the one you missed.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Accidentally using too much steroid nasal spray is unlikely to be harmful. Speak to a pharmacist or doctor if you're worried.
Using a steroid nasal spray too much over a long period can increase your risk of getting side effects.
Stopping treatment
If you've bought a steroid nasal spray from a pharmacy or shop, check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. This will tell you how long you can continuously use it for without speaking to a doctor or pharmacist. This is usually between 1 and 3 months.
Stop using it when you think you no longer need it. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure when to stop.
If you're taking a prescription spray, do not stop using it unless the doctor advises you to do so."
Side effects of steroid nasal sprays,"Steroid nasal sprays do not usually cause any significant side effects if used correctly and at normal doses.
Side effects can include:
a stinging or burning sensation in the nose
dryness and crustiness in the nose
a dry, irritated throat
an unpleasant taste in the mouth
itchiness, redness and swelling in the nose
nosebleeds
Serious side effects are rare but can include changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision or a cloudy lens in the eye, or problems with your breathing. See a doctor or contact 111 straight away if you have these.
If you're taking a high dose for a long time, there's also a small chance you could get some of the side effects of steroid tablets, such as increased appetite, mood changes and sleeping problems (insomnia).
You can report any suspected side effect on the UK Yellow Card safety scheme website."
"Using steroid nasal sprays with other medicines, food or alcohol","Some medicines can interfere with the way steroid nasal sprays work, although this is uncommon.
Check the leaflet that comes with your spray to see if it could be affected by other medicines. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you're unsure.
You can usually drink alcohol while using a steroid nasal spray and you do not normally need to avoid any particular foods."
Who can use steroid nasal sprays,"Most people can use steroid nasal sprays.
Ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice before using one if you:
have had an allergic reaction to steroids in the past
have recently had surgery on your nose
have ever had tuberculosis (TB)
have an infection in your nose or sinuses
are taking, or have recently taken, other steroid medicines
are looking for a nasal spray for your child (some nasal sprays are not suitable for children)
are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby
Steroid nasal sprays are normally safe to use while breastfeeding and during pregnancy, but it's a good idea to get medical advice first."
How steroid nasal sprays work,"Steroids closely copy the effects of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, which are 2 small glands above the kidneys.
When sprayed into the nose, steroids reduce inflammation (swelling).
This can help relieve symptoms such as sneezing and a runny or blocked nose. It can also help to reduce the size of any swellings (such as polyps in your nose.
Steroid nasal sprays are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass."
How and when to take steroid tablets,"Take your medicine as instructed by your doctor. They'll explain how much to take and how often.
It's normally best to take steroid tablets with or soon after a meal – usually breakfast – because this can stop them irritating your stomach.
If you miss a dose or take too much
If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the one you missed.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you take more than your prescribed dose of steroid tablets, contact 111 for advice.
Taking too many steroid tablets over a long period can make you more likely to get side effects.
Coming off treatment
Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor.
If you've been taking steroid tablets for more than a few weeks, you usually need to reduce your dose gradually. Stopping suddenly can cause your adrenal gland, which makes important hormones for the body, to stop working. This is known as adrenal insufficiency.
Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include:
feeling extremely tired
feeling and being sick
dizziness
loss of appetite and weight loss
Your original symptoms may also come back suddenly.
Your doctor will be able to provide more advice about how to safely stop taking steroids."
Side effects of steroid tablets,"Taking steroid tablets for less than 3 weeks is unlikely to cause any significant long-term side effects. But you may get some side effects if you need to take them for longer, at a high dose or if you need frequent courses.
Side effects of steroid tablets can include:
indigestion or heartburn
increased appetite, which could lead to weight gain
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
changes in mood and behaviour, such as feeling irritable or anxious
an increased risk of infections – especially chickenpox, shingles and measles
high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) or diabetes
weakening of the bones (osteoporosis)
high blood pressure (hypertension)
Cushing's syndrome – which can cause symptoms such as thin skin that bruises easily, a build-up of fat on the neck and shoulders and a puffy, rounded face that may also look red
eye conditions, such as glaucoma and cataracts
mental health problems, such as depression or suicidal thoughts; get an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if this happens
Most side effects will pass once treatment stops. Tell your doctor if they bother you.
You can report any suspected side effect on the UK Yellow Card safety scheme website."
"Taking steroid tablets with other medicines, food or alcohol","Some medicines interfere with the way steroid tablets work. Tell your doctor if you take any other medicines, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting steroid tablets.
If you're already taking steroid tablets, ask your doctor or a pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicines, remedies or supplements.
You can usually drink alcohol while taking steroid tablets, but do not drink too much as this may irritate your stomach.
You can also eat most foods while taking steroid tablets. Do not eat liquorice while taking prednisolone, however, as this can increase the amount of the medicine in your body."
Who can take steroid tablets,"Most people can take steroid tablets.
Tell your doctor before starting treatment if you:
have had an allergic reaction to steroids in the past
have an infection (including eye infections)
you have recently had, or are about to have, any vaccinations
have an open wound that has not healed yet
are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby
have any other conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, high blood pressure, or problems with your liver, heart or kidneys
have a mental health problem, such as depression
Steroid tablets may not be suitable in these cases, although your doctor may recommend them if they think the benefits outweigh any risks.
Steroid tablets are not usually recommended for children as they can cause growth problems."
How steroid tablets work,"Steroids closely copy the effects of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and arthritis.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
Steroid tablets are different from the anabolic steroids used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass."
Causes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome is often caused by your body reacting to certain medicines, particularly some types of:
epilepsy medicines
antibiotics
anti-inflammatory painkillers
Medicines commonly linked to Stevens-Johnson syndrome
In children, Stevens-Johnson syndrome can sometimes be caused by infections like cold or flu, cold sores and glandular fever.
Who is at higher risk
You're more likely to get Stevens-Johnson syndrome if:
you've had it before after taking a certain medicine – you're more likely to get it again if you take that medicine again or other similar medicines
you have a weakened immune system – for example, from having a condition like HIV or AIDS, or treatments like chemotherapy
a close family member has had Stevens-Johnson syndrome – sometimes your genes can mean you're at higher risk of getting it
Important
Stevens-Johnson syndrome is rare and the risk of getting it is low, even if you're taking a medicine that can cause it."
Symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome can start with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, sore throat, cough and joint pain.
A rash appears a few days later. It's made up of circular patches that are darker in the middle and lighter around the outside.
Credit:
The rash usually starts on the upper body before quickly spreading to the face, arms, legs and other areas of the body, such as the genitals. It's not usually itchy.
Blisters then appear on your skin, which burst to leave painful sores. The skin often peels very easily.
Credit:
You can also get blisters and sores:
on your lips and in your mouth and throat – this can make swallowing painful
in the tube that carries pee out of your body – this can cause pain when peeing
on your eyes – this can cause eye pain, pain when looking at bright lights and problems with your sight"
Treatments for Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome is treated in hospital, often in an intensive care unit.
Without treatment, the symptoms can become life-threatening.
If it's thought Stevens-Johnson syndrome is being caused by a medicine you're taking, the medicine will be stopped.
You'll have treatment to relieve your symptoms, which may include:
fluids into a vein to prevent dehydration
creams and dressings to moisturise and protect the skin
strong painkillers to help ease any pain
medicines to control inflammation and prevent infection"
Recovering from Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"It may take several weeks or months for you to fully recover from Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It's likely you'll feel very tired for a few weeks after leaving hospital.
Your skin will usually take about 2 or 3 weeks to heal, but it can sometimes take longer if you get a skin infection.
If your symptoms were caused by a reaction to a medicine, you'll need to avoid taking that medicine (and possibly other similar ones) for the rest of your life. Your doctor will be able to discuss this with you."
Complications of Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome can cause serious complications including:
skin problems like a skin infection, changes in skin colour and scarring
problems with organs, such as the lungs, liver and kidneys
eye problems, such as long-term inflammation or sight problems
problems with the vagina or penis caused by scarring"
Causes of stillbirth,"Some stillbirths are linked to complications with the placenta, a birth defect or with the mother's health. For others, no cause is found.
Read more about causes of stillbirth."
When a baby dies before they're born,"If your baby has died, you may be able to wait for labour to start naturally or your labour may be induced. If your health is at risk, the baby may need to be delivered as soon as possible. It's rare for a stillborn baby to be delivered by caesarean section.
Read more about what to expect if your baby dies before birth."
After a stillbirth,"After a stillbirth, decisions about what to do are very personal. There's no right or wrong way to respond.
A specialist midwife will talk with you about what you want to do – for example, holding the baby or taking photographs. They can also discuss the tests you may be offered to find out why your baby died and give you information about registering the birth.
Read more about what happens after a stillbirth, including information about baby-loss support groups."
Preventing stillbirths,"Not all stillbirths can be prevented, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:
not smoking
avoiding alcohol and drugs during pregnancy – these can seriously affect your baby's development, and increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth
not going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks – don't worry if you wake up on your back, just turn onto your side before you go back to sleep
attending all your antenatal appointments so that midwives can monitor the growth and wellbeing of your baby
taking folic acid before pregnancy and having a flu vaccine during your pregnancy
limiting the amount of caffeine you consume during pregnancy"
Common causes of stomach ache,"These are some common types of stomach ache and what may be causing them. But see a GP if you're unsure and worried.
Types of stomach ache and possible common causes
Type of stomach ache Possible condition
Feeling bloated, farting a lot
Trapped wind (flatulence)
Feeling full and bloated after eating, heartburn, feeling sick
Indigestion
Cannot poo
Constipation
Watery poo, feeling sick, vomiting
Stomach bug or food poisoning"
A pharmacist can help with stomach ache,"Speak to a pharmacist about:
what might be causing your stomach ache
treatments that might help
medicines for constipation and indigestion
Find a pharmacy"
Other causes of stomach ache,"Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
Types of stomach ache and possible less common causes
Type of stomach ache Possible condition
Pain and cramps when you have your period
Period pain
Sudden pain in the lower right-hand side
Appendicitis
Ongoing cramps, bloating, diarrhoea, constipation
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Bad ongoing pain that can go down to your groin, nausea, pain when peeing
Kidney stones
Severe pain that lasts for hours in the centre of your tummy or just under the ribs on the right-hand side
Gallstones"
Signs and symptoms,"The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the tummy (abdomen).
But stomach ulcers aren't always painful and some people may experience other symptoms, such as indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux and feeling sick."
When to seek medical advice,"You should visit your GP if you think you may have a stomach ulcer.
Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately if:
you are passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools
you have a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse
Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 if:
you are vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance, similar to coffee grounds
These could be a sign of a serious complication, such as internal bleeding."
Causes of stomach ulcers,"Stomach ulcers happen when there’s damage to the layer that protects the stomach lining from the acids in your stomach.
This is usually a result of:
an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria
taking anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses
It used to be thought that stress or certain foods might cause stomach ulcers, but there's little evidence to suggest this is the case.
Stomach ulcers can affect anyone but are more common in people aged 60 or over. Men are more affected than women."
How stomach ulcers are treated,"Treatment will depend on what caused the ulcer.
Most people will be prescribed a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of acid in their stomach.
You’ll also need antibiotics if your ulcers were caused by a H. pylori infection.
Stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed."
Possible complications,"Complications of stomach ulcers are relatively uncommon, but they can be very serious and potentially life threatening.
The main complications include:
bleeding at the site of the ulcer
the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splitting open (perforation)
the ulcer blocking the movement of food through the digestive system (gastric obstruction)
Read more about the complications of stomach ulcers."
Symptoms of a strep A infection,"Common symptoms of strep A include:
flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, swollen glands or an aching body
sore throat (strep throat or tonsillitis)
a rash that feels rough, like sandpaper (scarlet fever)
scabs and sores (impetigo)
pain and swelling (cellulitis)
severe muscle aches
nausea and vomiting
Strep A infections are more common in children, but adults can also sometimes get them.
Most strep A infections are not serious and can be treated with antibiotics.
But rarely, the infection can cause serious problems. This is called invasive group A strep (iGAS)."
What to do if your child is unwell,"It can be difficult to tell when a child is seriously ill, but the main thing is to trust your instincts.
You know better than anyone else what your child is usually like, so you'll know when something is seriously wrong.
If your child does not seem to be seriously ill, you can usually look after them at home. They should feel better in a few days.
If they're uncomfortable, you can give them children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen. Check the leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child and to see how much to give them.
A pharmacist can give you advice about how to ease your child's symptoms and whether you need to see a doctor.
Find a pharmacy
Information:
More advice about:
high temperature in children
sore throat
rashes in babies and children"
Treatments for a strep A infection,"Most strep A infections can be easily treated with antibiotics.
If you or your child has a strep A infection, you should stay away from nursery, school or work for 24 hours after you start taking antibiotics. This will help stop the infection spreading to other people.
Serious strep A infections (invasive group A strep, iGAS) need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics."
How you get strep A infections,"Strep A infections are spread by close contact with an infected person. They can be passed on through coughs and sneezes or from a wound.
In some people, the bacteria live in the body without causing symptoms or making them feel unwell. But they can still pass the bacteria on to others.
Things that might make you more at risk of strep A infections include:
a weakened immune system
open sores or wounds
some viral infections, such as a cold or flu"
How to avoid getting infections,"Infections like strep A can easily be spread to other people.
To reduce the chance of catching or spreading an infection:
avoid close contact with someone you know is infected
wash your hands often with soap and water
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as quickly as possible"
Check if you have stretch marks,"Stretch marks look like lines or streaks across the skin.
Stretch marks can be pink, red, brown, black, silver or purple. They usually start off darker and fade over time.
Credit:
Stretch marks are most common on the tummy, breasts, chest, upper arms, legs, bottom, hips or back.
Credit:"
Common causes of stretch marks,"Stretch marks are often caused by sudden growth or weight gain.
You may be more likely to get them if you:
are pregnant
are going through puberty
lose or gain weight quickly
are female
are overweight
use some kinds of steroid creams or tablets
have a family member with stretch marks
Rarely, stretch marks can be due to a condition called Cushing's syndrome."
What to do about stretch marks,"Stretch marks usually fade over time but may not disappear completely.
Many creams and lotions claim to prevent, reduce or remove stretch marks. But there's very little evidence these work.
There are some treatments that may help make stretch marks look better, but they will not get rid of them.
They include:
retinoid (often called tretinoin) creams or hyaluronic acid – these may help if used on new stretch marks, but you should not use retinoid creams if you're pregnant as they may harm your baby
light or laser treatments
microdermabrasion, which removes a thin layer of skin
You would need to pay for these treatments as they're not available on the NHS.
Information:
It's not always possible to prevent stretch marks. The best way to reduce your chance of getting them is by maintaining a healthy weight."
Symptoms of a stroke,"The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST:
Face – the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped.
Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm.
Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake; they may also have problems understanding what you're saying to them.
Time – it's time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms."
Causes of a stroke,"Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly.
If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death.
There are 2 main causes of strokes:
ischaemic – where the blood supply is stopped because of a blood clot, accounting for 85% of all cases
haemorrhagic – where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts
There's also a related condition called a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where the blood supply to the brain is temporarily interrupted.
This causes what's known as a mini-stroke. It can last a few minutes or persist up to 24 hours.
TIAs should be treated urgently, as they're often a warning sign you're at risk of having a full stroke in the near future.
Get medical advice as soon as possible, even if your symptoms get better.
Certain conditions increase the risk of having a stroke, including:
high blood pressure (hypertension)
high cholesterol
irregular heart beats (atrial fibrillation)
diabetes"
Treating a stroke,"Treatment depends on the type of stroke you have, including which part of the brain was affected and what caused it.
Strokes are usually treated with medicine. This includes medicines to prevent and dissolve blood clots, reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels.
In some cases, procedures may be required to remove blood clots. Surgery may also be needed to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding if this was the cause of your stroke."
Recovering from a stroke,"People who survive a stroke are often left with long-term problems caused by injury to their brain.
Some people need a long period of rehabilitation before they can recover their former independence, while many never fully recover and need ongoing support after their stroke.
Local authorities should provide free reablement services for anyone assessed as needing them. These services help the person recovering from a stroke learn or relearn the skills they need to live at home independently.
Some people will continue to need some form of care or help with their daily activities.
For example, a care worker may come to the person's home to help with washing and dressing, or to provide companionship.

recovering from a stroke
If you're recovering from a stroke or caring for someone who is, you may find the social care and support guide useful.
It's written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives."
Preventing a stroke,"You can significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke if you:
eat well
take regular exercise
follow alcohol advice (not drinking more than 14 units a week)
quit smoking
If you have a condition that increases your risk of a stroke, it's important to manage it effectively. For example, taking medicine you've been prescribed to lower high blood pressure or cholesterol levels.
If you've had a stroke or TIA in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke is greatly increased."
Stroke in children,"Stroke does not just affect adults. Every year around 400 children in the UK have a stroke, according to the Stroke Association.

Check if you have a stye,"A stye is a small, painful lump on or inside the eyelid or around the eye.
Credit:
The skin around the stye may be swollen and red and the stye may be filled with yellow pus. The redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin.
Credit:
Your eye may be red and watery but your vision should not be affected.
Credit:
A stye usually only affects 1 eye, but it's possible to have more than 1 at a time.
It's probably not a stye if:
there's no lump – if your eye or eyelid is swollen, red and watery it's more likely to be conjunctivitis or blepharitis
the lump is hard but not very painful – it's more likely to be a chalazion"
How you can treat a stye yourself,"To reduce swelling and help the stye heal:
Soak a clean flannel in warm water.
Hold it against your eye for 5 to 10 minutes.
Repeat this 3 or 4 times a day.
To relieve the pain, take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Do not give aspirin to children under 16.
Avoid wearing contact lenses and eye make-up until the stye has burst and healed.
Important:
Do not burst a stye
Do not try to burst a stye or remove an eyelash yourself. This can spread the infection."
Treatment from a GP,"If you have a stye, the GP may:
burst the stye with a thin, sterilised needle
remove the eyelash closest to the stye
refer you to an eye specialist in hospital"
You cannot always prevent a stye,"Styes are often caused by bacteria infecting an eyelash follicle or eyelid gland.
You're also more likely to get a stye if you have long-term blepharitis or rosacea.
You can help avoid styes by keeping your eyes clean.
Do
wash your face and remove eye make-up before bed
replace your eye make-up every 6 months
keep your eyelids and eyelashes clean, especially if you have blepharitis
Don’t
do not share towels or flannels with someone who has a stye
do not rub your eyes if you have not recently washed your hands
do not put contact lenses in before washing your hands"
When to seek medical advice,"You should always seek emergency medical treatment after a severe head injury.
Go to your nearest A&E department or call 999.
If you develop the symptoms above any time after a minor head injury, you should also go to your nearest A&E department or call 999 for an ambulance as soon as possible.
A subdural haematoma can be very serious and needs to be assessed as quickly as possible.
Read more about diagnosing subdural haematomas."
What causes subdural haematomas?,"A subdural haematoma occurs when a blood vessel in the space between the skull and the brain (the subdural space) is damaged.
Blood escapes from the blood vessel, leading to the formation of a blood clot (haematoma) that places pressure on the brain and damages it.
Head injuries that cause subdural haematomas are often severe, such as those from a car crash, fall or violent assault.
But minor bumps to the head can also lead to a subdural haematoma in a few cases.
A minor head injury is more likely to lead to a subdural haematoma if you're over 60, taking anticoagulant (""blood-thinning"") medicine or have a history of alcohol misuse.
Read more about the causes of a subdural haematoma."
How subdural haematomas are treated,"Subdural haematomas usually need to be treated with surgery as soon as possible.
The 2 most widely used surgical techniques for subdural haematomas are:
craniotomy – a section of the skull is temporarily removed so the surgeon can access and remove the haematoma
burr holes – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a tube is inserted through the hole to help drain the haematoma
In a few cases, very small subdural haematomas may be carefully monitored first to see if they heal without having an operation.
Read more about treating subdural haematomas."
Outlook,"A subdural haematoma is a serious condition that carries a high risk of death, particularly in older people and those whose brain was severely damaged.
Acute subdural haematomas are the most serious type because they're often associated with significant damage to the brain.
Those who survive an acute subdural haematoma may take a long time to recover, and may be left with physical disabilities and cognitive problems such as memory and speech problems.
The outlook is generally better for subacute and chronic haematomas. Most people who are fit enough to have surgery eventually make a full recovery.
But because many people with these types of haematoma are older, they may be too frail to have treatment.
Read more about recovering from a subdural haematoma."
What causes SIDS?,"The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it's thought to be down to a combination of factors.
Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby's development and that it affects babies vulnerable to certain environmental stresses.
This vulnerability may be caused by being born prematurely or having a low birthweight, or because of other reasons that have not been identified yet. 
Environmental stresses could include tobacco smoke, getting tangled in bedding, a minor illness or a breathing obstruction. There's also an association between sleeping with your baby on a sofa or chair and SIDS.
Babies who die of SIDS are thought to have problems in the way they respond to these stresses and how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and temperature.
Although the cause of SIDS is not fully understood, there are a number of things you can do to reduce the risk.
What can I do to help prevent SIDS?
Do
always place your baby on their back to sleep
place your baby in the ""feet to foot"" position – with their feet touching the end of the cot, Moses basket, or pram
keep your baby's head uncovered – their blanket should be tucked in no higher than their shoulders
let your baby sleep in the same room as you for the first 6 months
make sure there are no pillows or duvets near your baby if you share a bed with them
keep other children and pets out of the bed if you share a bed with your baby
use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition
breastfeed your baby, if you can – see benefits of breastfeeding for more information
make sure you use a sling or baby-carrier safely – The Lullaby Trust has more information
Don’t
do not share a bed with your baby if you or your partner smoke or take recreational drugs, have had 2 or more units of alcohol or have taken medicine that causes drowsiness
do not share a bed with your baby if they weighed under 2.5kg when they were born
do not smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby – both before and after birth
do not sleep on a sofa or armchair with your baby
do not let your baby get too hot or too cold – a room temperature of 16C to 20C, with light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby
Read more about reducing the risk of SIDS."
Seeking medical advice if your baby is unwell,"Babies often have minor illnesses that you do not need to worry about. Give your baby plenty of fluids to drink and do not let them get too hot.
If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS 111 for advice.
Read more about spotting signs of serious illness in children.
Immediate action required:
Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby:
stops breathing or turns blue
is struggling for breath
is unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on
will not wake up
has a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover"
Support services,"If a baby or child dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A post-mortem examination will usually be necessary, which can be very distressing for the family.
The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and ensure the family is supported. They should be able to put you in touch with local sources of help and support.
Many people find talking to others who have had similar experiences helps them to cope with their bereavement.
If you've been affected by SIDS, the Lullaby Trust provides advice and support for bereaved families. Specially trained advisers are available on its helpline – the number is 0808 802 6868 and it's open Monday to Friday (10am to 5pm), and at weekends and public holidays (6pm to 10pm).
You can also email support@lullabytrust.org.uk or visit the Lullaby Trust website for further information and support.

Check if you have sunburn,"If you have sunburn, your skin may:
feel hot to touch
feel sore or painful
flake or peel - this usually happens a few days after you get sunburn
Your skin may also blister if your sunburn is severe.
If you have white skin, your skin will usually be red or pink. If you have black or brown skin, you may not notice a change in the colour of your skin."
How to ease sunburn yourself,"There are things you can do to help ease symptoms of sunburn.
Do
get out of the sun as soon as possible
cool your skin with a cool shower, bath or damp towel (take care not to let a baby or young child get too cold)
apply aftersun cream or spray
drink plenty of water to cool down and prevent dehydration
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for any pain
cover sunburnt skin from direct sunlight until skin has fully healed
Don’t
do not use petroleum jelly on sunburnt skin
do not put ice or ice packs on sunburnt skin
do not pop any blisters
do not scratch or try to remove peeling skin
do not wear tight-fitting clothes over sunburnt skin
Information:
Some medicines are not safe for everyone (for example, if you're pregnant). Always check the leaflet or speak to a pharmacist before taking them.

Causes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT),"SVT happens when the electrical system that controls your heart rhythm is not working properly.
This causes your heart to suddenly beat much faster. It can then slow down abruptly.
A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). But with SVT your heart rate suddenly goes above 100bpm. This can happen when you're resting or doing exercise."
Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT),"Having SVT means your heart suddenly beats faster.
This:
usually lasts for a few minutes, but can sometimes last for several hours
can happen several times a day or once a year – it varies
can be triggered by tiredness, caffeine, alcohol or drugs – but often there's no obvious trigger
can happen at any age, but often starts for the first time in children and young adults – many people have their first symptoms between 25 and 40
You may get no other symptoms, but sometimes people also:
have chest pain
feel weak, breathless or lightheaded
feel tired
feel sick or are sick"
Things you can do to help with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT),"If your episodes of SVT only last a few minutes and do not bother you, you may not need treatment.
You can make changes to your lifestyle to reduce your chances of having episodes, such as:
cutting down on the amount of caffeine or alcohol you drink
stopping or cutting back on smoking
making sure you get enough rest
Your doctor may also be able to recommend some simple techniques to help stop episodes when they happen."
Treating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in hospital,"SVT is rarely life threatening. But you may need treatment in hospital if you keep having long episodes.
This may include:
medicines to control the episodes of SVT – given as tablets or through a vein
cardioversion – a small electric shock to the heart to help it get back to a normal rhythm
catheter ablation – a treatment where thin tubes are placed through a vein or artery into your heart to correct the problem with the electrical system; this permanently cures the problem in most patients"
"Common causes of swollen ankles, feet and legs","Swelling in the ankles, feet and legs is often caused by a build-up of fluid in these areas, called oedema.
Oedema is usually caused by:
standing or sitting in the same position for too long
eating too much salty food
being overweight
being pregnant
taking certain medicines – such as some blood pressure medicines, contraceptive pills, hormone therapy, antidepressants or steroids
Oedema can also be caused by:
an injury – such as a strain or sprain
an insect bite or sting
problems with your kidneys, liver or heart
a blood clot
an infection"
Check if you have oedema,"Symptoms of oedema include:
Swollen or puffy ankles, feet or legs.
Credit:
Shiny or stretched skin.
Credit:
Changes in skin colour, discomfort, stiffness and dents when you press on the skin."
How to ease swelling yourself,"Swelling in your ankles, feet or legs should go away on its own, but there are some things you can try to help.
Do
raise your legs or the swollen area on a chair or pillows when you can
get some gentle exercise, like walking, to improve your blood flow
wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
wash, dry and moisturise your feet to avoid infections
Don’t
do not stand or sit for long periods of time
do not wear clothes, socks or shoes that are too tight"
Treatment for swelling and oedema,"Treatment for swelling or oedema that does not go away on its own will depend on the cause. Your GP can help you with the right treatment.
Speak to your GP about making, lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or going on a low-salt diet."
Common causes of swollen arms and hands,"Swelling in the arms and hands is often caused by a build-up of fluid in these areas.
It's usually caused by:
staying in the same position for too long
eating too much salty food
being pregnant
taking certain medicines – such as some blood pressure medicines, contraceptive pills, antidepressants and steroids
It can also be caused by:

How to ease swelling yourself,"Swelling in your arms or hands should go away on its own, but there are some things you can try to help.
Do
lie down and use pillows to raise the swollen area when you can
move your whole arm and shoulder
try raising your hand above your head while you open and close your fist
massage your arm or hand towards your body using firm but not painful pressure – for example, start at your fingertips and massage towards your palm
get some gentle exercise, like walking, to improve your blood flow
drink plenty of water
wash, dry and moisturise your arms or hands to avoid infections
put your hands in a bath of warm water and then cold water to help move the fluid away from the area
Don’t
do not stay in the same position for long periods of time
do not wear clothes that are too tight"
Treatment for swelling,"Treatment for swelling or oedema that does not go away on its own will depend on the cause.
Possible treatments include:
changing your medicine if this is the cause of the swelling
treating any condition that is causing the swelling
diuretics (water pills) to help reduce the swelling
wearing special gloves or sleeves to stop any swelling from coming back (compression aids)
Treatment may also include lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or going on a low-salt diet."
Check if your glands are swollen,"Swollen glands feel like tender, painful lumps:
on each side of the neck
under the chin
in the armpits
around the groin
Glands (known as lymph glands or lymph nodes) swell near an infection to help your body fight it.
Sometimes a gland on just one side of the body swells.
You might also have other symptoms, such as a sore throat, cough or high temperature."
Things you can do yourself,"Swollen glands should go down within 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the cause.
You can help to ease the symptoms by:
resting
drinking plenty of fluids (to avoid dehydration)
taking painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16)"
Causes of swollen glands,"Swollen glands are:
often caused by common illnesses like colds, tonsillitis and ear or throat infections
sometimes caused by viral infections such as glandular fever
rarely caused by anything more serious, like cancer of the blood (leukaemia) or lymph system (lymphoma)
Do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
A GP will be able to recommend treatment depending on the cause, which might include antibiotics (antibiotics do not work on viral infections)."
Check if you have syphilis,"The symptoms of syphilis are often mild and hard to notice. They tend to change over time and may come and go.
Symptoms of syphilis include:
small sores (ulcers) on your penis, vagina, or around your bottom (anus) – these are usually painless and you may only have one of them
sores in other areas, including in your mouth or on your lips, hands or bottom
white or grey warty growths most commonly on your penis, vagina or around your anus
a rash on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet that can sometimes spread all over your body – this is not usually itchy
white patches in your mouth
flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headaches and tiredness
swollen glands
patchy hair loss on the head, beard and eyebrows
It can take 3 weeks or more for the symptoms of syphilis to appear after you're infected.
Sometimes the symptoms can improve or go away completely, but if you have not been treated the infection is still in your body.
This means you can still pass it on and you're at risk of getting serious problems later on."
What happens during a syphilis test,"If you have symptoms of syphilis, a doctor or nurse will check your penis, vagina and bottom (anus) for syphilis sores (ulcers). They may use a swab (like a cotton bud) to collect a fluid sample from any sores.
They'll also check the rest of your body for other signs of syphilis like a rash, sores or wart-like growths. They may also take a blood sample.
You may also have tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the same time.
Information:
Contacting sexual partners
If you have syphilis, your current and any recent sexual partners will also need to be tested and treated.
The GP or sexual health clinic can advise you about contacting your sexual partners. This can be done without naming you."
Treatment for syphilis,"Syphilis is treated with antibiotics, which you may have as injections, tablets or capsules.
Treatment may be started before your test result is known. How long you need treatment for will depend on the stage of your syphilis.
In some people, treatment can cause flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headache and aching muscles. This usually lasts for up to 24 hours.
You'll need to go back to the GP surgery or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested.
Important
Do not have sex (vaginal, anal or oral) until you and your partner have finished treatment and tests have shown treatment has worked."
Complications of syphilis,"If it's not treated, syphilis can cause serious and potentially life-threatening problems including:
heart problems like angina, aortic aneurysm and heart failure
brain problems like fits (seizures), memory problems, personality changes and dementia
nerve problems like shooting pains, pins and needles, joint pain and gradual damage the joints
problems with the skin, bones, testicles, liver and any other organ
Some of these problems may not appear for many years after being infected with syphilis.
Syphilis during pregnancy
If you're pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they're born. This is known as congenital syphilis.
Having syphilis during pregnancy can also increase your risk of miscarriage, premature birth and stillbirth.
You'll be offered screening for syphilis if you're pregnant so it can be found and treated before it causes any serious problems."
How you get syphilis,"The most common way of getting syphilis is by having unprotected sex (vaginal, anal or oral sex without a condom) with someone who's infected.
You can get the infection if you come into contact with an ulcer on their penis, vagina, bottom (anus), or inside their mouth.
It's also possible for syphilis to be passed on:
to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis)
by injecting drugs with a needle that's been used by an infected person
during a blood or organ transplant (this is rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis)"
Preventing syphilis,"There are some things you can do to avoid getting syphilis and passing it on to others.
Do
use a condom when you have vaginal or anal sex
use a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex
make sure you complete treatment if you or your partner have syphilis
Don’t
do not share sex toys (or wash and cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them)
do not share needles if you inject drugs"
Symptoms,"Symptoms of infantile Tay-Sachs disease usually start when a child is 3 to 6 months old.
The main symptoms include:
being overly startled by noises and movement
being very slow to reach milestones like learning to crawl, and losing skills they have already learnt
floppiness and weakness, which keeps getting worse until they're unable to move (paralysis)
difficulty swallowing
loss of vision or hearing
muscle stiffness
seizures (fits)
The condition is usually fatal by around 3 to 5 years of age, often due to complications of a lung infection (pneumonia).
Rarer types of Tay-Sachs disease start later in childhood (juvenile Tay-Sachs disease) or early adulthood (late-onset Tay-Sachs disease). The late-onset type doesn't always shorten life expectancy."
How it's inherited,"Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a problem in a child's genes that means their nerves stop working properly.
A child can only have it if both parents have this faulty gene. The parents themselves don't usually have any symptoms – this is known as being a ""carrier"".
If 2 people who are carriers have a child, there's a:
1 in 4 (25%) chance the child won't inherit any faulty genes and won't have Tay-Sachs disease or be able to pass it on
1 in 2 (50%) chance the child inherits a faulty gene from one parent and becomes a carrier, but won't have the condition themselves
1 in 4 (25%) chance the child inherits a faulty gene from both parents and develops Tay-Sachs disease"
When to get medical advice,"Speak to your GP if:
you're planning a pregnancy and you or your partner have an Ashkenazi Jewish background, a history of Tay-Sachs disease in either of your families, or you know you're carriers
you're pregnant and concerned your baby could have Tay-Sachs disease – you can also speak to your midwife for advice
you're worried your child might have symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease – especially if someone in your family had it
If you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you may be referred for genetic and genomic testing to see if you're at risk of having a child with Tay-Sachs disease and to talk to a genetics counsellor about your options.
If your child has possible symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease, a blood test can show if they have it."
Treatments,"There's currently no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. The aim of treatment is to make living with it as comfortable as possible.
You'll see a team of specialists, who will help come up with a treatment plan for your child.
Treatments may include:
medicines for seizures and stiffness
speech and language therapy for feeding and swallowing problems – sometimes special bottles or a feeding tube may be needed
physiotherapy to help with stiffness and improve coughing (to reduce the risk of pneumonia)
antibiotics to treat infections like pneumonia if they occur
Your care team will talk to you about end of life care, such as where you'd like your child to receive care and if you'd like them to be resuscitated if their lungs stop working."
Further information and advice,"You can get more information and support from:
the Cure & Action for Tay-Sachs (CATS) Foundation
Climb
Genetic Alliance UK
the National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) – an American foundation for people with Tay-Sachs disease
If you're interested in finding out more about research into treatments for Tay-Sachs disease, ask your care team about any research you might be able to get involved in.
Information about your child
If your child has Tay-Sachs disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service register on GOV.UK."
Check if you have tuberculosis (TB),"Symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) usually come on gradually.
Common symptoms include:
a cough that lasts more than 3 weeks – you may cough up mucus (phlegm) or mucus with blood in it
feeling tired or exhausted
a high temperature or night sweats
loss of appetite
weight loss
feeling generally unwell
Children may also have difficulty gaining weight or growing.
If TB has spread to another part of your body such as your glands (lymph nodes), bones or brain, you may also have other symptoms, including:
swollen glands
body aches and pains
swollen joints or ankles
tummy or pelvic pain
constipation
dark or cloudy pee
a headache
being sick
feeling confused
a stiff neck
a rash on the legs, face or other part of the body
If you have TB and you have symptoms, it's called active TB.
Sometimes you can have TB in your body but have no symptoms. This is called latent TB."
Tests to check for tuberculosis (TB),"If you have symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), tests you may have include:
an X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram or CT scan of your chest or the part of your body that may be affected
taking samples of your mucus (phlegm)
a biopsy to take a sample of tissue, cells or fluid from the affected area
If you have no symptoms but are at risk from TB (for example, you've been in close contact with someone who has TB) you may have a Mantoux test or blood tests to check if you have it.
A Mantoux test is a skin test where a small amount of liquid is injected under the skin in your arm. This liquid will cause a small reaction on your skin if you have TB."
Treatment for tuberculosis (TB),"The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months.
If TB has spread to your brain, spinal cord or the area around your heart, you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks.
If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months.
Important
It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, TB could come back."
Causes of tuberculosis (TB),"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB).
When someone with active TB coughs, they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time.
Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active TB in the future.
People who are more likely to get TB
Anyone can get TB, but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it, including people who:
spend a lot of time with someone who has active TB, such as people living in the same house
were born in or lived in an area where TB is more common
have a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV, a kidney transplant or who are having certain treatment like chemotherapy
are under 5 years of age
live in overcrowded or unhealthy conditions, such as people who are homeless
regularly smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs
have had TB before and it was not treated properly"
Tuberculosis (TB) vaccination,"There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine.
It's recommended for some people who are at higher risk of catching TB or getting seriously ill from it, including:
babies who live in areas of the UK where TB is more common
babies and children who live with someone who has TB
babies and children who were born or lived in a country where TB is more common
babies and children whose parents or grandparents were born in a country where TB is more common
people aged 35 and under who are spending more than 3 months in a country where TB is more common
people at risk of getting TB through their work, such as healthcare workers who work with people who have TB"
How to treat tendonitis yourself,"Follow these steps for 2 to 3 days to help manage pain and support the tendon.
Rest: try to avoid moving the tendon for 2 to 3 days.
Ice: put an ice pack (or try a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel on the tendon for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours.
Support: wrap an elastic bandage around the area, use a tube bandage, or use a soft brace. You can buy these from pharmacies. It should be snug, not tight.
It's important to take a bandage or brace off before going to bed.
When you're able to move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint does not become stiff.
To help prevent further injury or pain, try to avoid:
heavy lifting, strong gripping or twisting actions that make the symptoms worse
playing any sport until the tendon has recovered
A pharmacist may be able to help with tendonitis
A pharmacist can recommend the best painkiller for you. Paracetamol and ibuprofen can help to ease pain.
They may also recommend an ibuprofen gel to rub on your skin.
Find a pharmacy"
Symptoms of tendonitis,"There are tendons all over your body. They connect your muscles to bones in your joints, for example, in your knees, elbows and shoulders.
The main symptoms of tendonitis are:
pain in a tendon that gets worse when you move
difficulty moving the joint
feeling a grating or crackling sensation when you move the tendon
swelling, sometimes with heat or redness
If the pain is sudden and severe, and happened during an accident or activity, you may have torn (ruptured) a tendon.
You might have heard a popping or snapping sound when the pain started."
Treatment for tendonitis,"If you need treatment for tendonitis a GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller or suggest you use an ibuprofen gel on your skin to ease the pain.
If the pain is severe, lasts a long time, or your movement is limited, you may be referred for physiotherapy. You can also see a physiotherapist privately.
If physiotherapy does not help, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in muscles and bones (orthopaedic specialist) or a local musculoskeletal clinic.
Some people with severe tendonitis may be offered:
steroid injections, which may provide short-term pain relief
surgery to remove damaged tissue or repair a ruptured tendon
Find a physiotherapist
Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have tendonitis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for tendonitis near you"
Preventing tendon problems,"Tendonitis is usually caused by sudden, sharp movements or repetitive exercise, such as running, jumping or throwing.
It can also be caused by repetitive movements, or having poor posture or technique while at work or when playing a sport. This is known as repetitive strain injury (RSI).
You cannot always prevent tendonitis. But there are things you can do to help reduce the chance of a tendon injury.
Do
warm up before exercising and gently stretch afterwards
wear supportive shoes or insoles for exercise
take regular breaks from repetitive exercises
Don’t
do not overexercise tired muscles
do not start a new sport without some training or practice
do not do the same repetitive exercises"
What causes tennis elbow?,"Tennis elbow is usually caused by overusing the muscles attached to your elbow and used to straighten your wrist. If the muscles are strained, tiny tears and inflammation can develop near the bony lump (the lateral epicondyle) on the outside of your elbow.
As the name suggests, tennis elbow is sometimes caused by playing tennis, but any activity that puts repeated stress on the elbow joint can cause it.
Pain that occurs on the inner side of the elbow is known as golfer's elbow.
Read more about the causes of tennis elbow"
When to see a GP,"You should avoid the activity that is causing the pain until your symptoms improve.
If the pain in your elbow does not go away after a few days of rest, visit a GP.
The GP will check for swelling and tenderness, and carry out some simple tests, such as stretching out your fingers and flexing your wrist while your elbow is stretched out.
If the GP thinks the pain is due to nerve damage, further tests, such as an ultrasound scan or an MRI scan, may be done."
Treating tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow will get better without treatment (a self-limiting condition), but there are treatments that may improve symptoms and speed up recovery.
You should rest your injured arm and stop any activity that's causing the problem.
Holding a cold compress, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, against your elbow for a few minutes several times a day can help ease the pain.
Taking painkillers, such as paracetamol, may help reduce mild pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also be used to help reduce inflammation.
Physiotherapy may be recommended in more severe cases. Massaging and manipulating the affected area may help relieve the pain and stiffness, and improve the range of movement in your arm.
Surgery may be used as a last resort to remove the damaged part of the tendon.
Tennis elbow can last between 6 months to 2 years, but a full recovery is made within a year in 9 out of 10 cases.

Information:
Self-refer for treatment
If you have tennis elbow, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.
To find out if there are any services in your area:
ask the reception staff at your GP surgery
check your GP surgery's website
contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB
search online for NHS treatment for tennis elbow near you"
Preventing tennis elbow,"It's not always easy to avoid getting tennis elbow, for instance if it was caused by something you do at work. Not putting too much stress on the muscles surrounding your elbow will help prevent the condition from getting worse.
If your tennis elbow is caused by a sport such as tennis or other activity that puts a repeated strain on your elbow joint, changing your technique may ease the problem.
Read more advice about preventing tennis elbow"
Who's affected by tennis elbow?,"Tennis elbow is a common condition that affects about 1-3% of the population (about 4 to 7 cases per 1000) every year.
It's the most common cause of persistent elbow pain, accounting for two-thirds of cases. It affects women and men equally, and those affected are mostly between the ages of 35-54."
What TENS is used for,"TENS may be able to help reduce pain and muscle spasms caused by a wide range of conditions including:
arthritis
period pain
pelvic pain caused by endometriosis
knee pain
sports injuries
It's also sometimes used as a method of pain relief during labour."
Does TENS work?,"There's not enough good-quality scientific evidence to say for sure whether TENS is a reliable method of pain relief. More research is needed and clinical trials are ongoing.
Healthcare professionals have reported that it seems to help some people, although how well it works depends on the individual and the condition being treated.
TENS is not a cure for pain and often only provides short-term relief while the TENS machine is being used.
However, the treatment is generally very safe and you may feel it's worth trying instead of, or in addition to, the usual medical treatments."
Trying TENS,"If you're thinking about trying TENS, it's a good idea to speak to a GP about a referral to a physiotherapist or pain clinic.
A physiotherapist or pain specialist may be able to loan you a TENS machine for a short period if they think it could help.
You can choose to buy your own TENS machine without getting medical advice, but it's generally better to have a proper assessment first, so you can find out whether a TENS machine is appropriate for you and be taught how to use it properly.
To get the most benefit from TENS, it's important that the settings are adjusted correctly for you and your individual condition.
If you find TENS effective, you can buy a TENS machine from a pharmacy. They range in price from about £20 to £100. More expensive machines are not necessarily any better than lower-priced ones, so it's best to do some research before you buy."
How to use TENS,"This is a general guide on how to use a TENS machine. Always follow the manufacturer's specific instructions.
TENS machines are small and lightweight, so you can use them while working or on the move. You can put it in your pocket, clip it to your belt or hold it in your hand.
You can use TENS throughout the day for as long as you like, although it should not be used while you're driving, operating machinery, or in the bath or shower. 
Positioning the pads
Make sure the machine is switched off before you attach the pads to your skin. Position the pads either side of the painful area, at least 2.5cm (1 inch) apart.
Never place the pads over:
the front or sides of your neck
your temples
your mouth or eyes
your chest and upper back at the same time
irritated, infected or broken skin
varicose veins
numb areas
Turning it on and adjusting the strength
Turn on the TENS machine when the pads are attached in the correct places. You'll feel a slight tingling sensation pass through your skin.
The machine has a dial that allows you to control the strength of the electrical impulses.
Start on a low setting and gradually increase it until the sensation feels strong but comfortable. If the tingling sensation starts to feel painful or uncomfortable, reduce it slightly.
Switch the TENS machine off after you've finished using it and remove the electrodes from your skin."
Are there any risks of side effects?,"For most people, TENS is a safe treatment with no side effects.
Some people may be allergic to the pads and their skin may become red and irritated. Speak to your GP, physiotherapist or pharmacist if you have concerns. You may need to take a short break from using TENS. Special pads are available for people with allergies.
TENS is not safe for everyone to use. Do not use it without first getting medical advice if:
you have a pacemaker or another type of electrical or metal implant in your body
you're pregnant, or there's a chance you might be pregnant – TENS may not be recommended early in pregnancy
you have epilepsy or a heart problem
you have an overactive bladder"
What happens at your GP appointment,"To find out what the cause of the lump or swelling in your testicle is, the GP may:
look at and feel your testicles
shine a torch through the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) to check for a build-up of fluid
refer you for an ultrasound scan
Treatment for a lump or swelling depends on the cause. You might not need treatment if it does not cause any problems and is not getting worse.
If the lump or swelling is painful or very big, the GP may refer you to a specialist for an operation to drain, shrink or remove it."
Causes of testicle lumps and swellings,"Lumps and swellings in the testicles can have lots of different causes.
Most are caused by something less serious, such as a build-up of fluid (cyst) or swollen veins in the testicles (varicocele).
But sometimes they can be a sign of something serious, such as testicular cancer.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your lump – always see a GP."
The testicles,"The testicles are the 2 oval-shaped male sex organs that sit inside the scrotum on either side of the penis.
The testicles are an important part of the male reproductive system because they produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which plays a major role in male sexual development."
Types of testicular cancer,"The different types of testicular cancer are classified by the type of cells the cancer begins in.
The most common type of testicular cancer is germ cell testicular cancer, which accounts for around 95% of all cases. Germ cells are a type of cell that the body uses to create sperm.
There are 2 main subtypes of germ cell testicular cancer. They are:
seminomas – which have become more common in the past 20 years and now account for 40 to 45% of testicular cancers
non-seminomas – which account for most of the rest and include teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and yolk sac tumours
Both types tend to respond well to chemotherapy.
Less common types of testicular cancer include:
Leydig cell tumours – which account for around 1 to 3% of cases
Sertoli cell tumours – which account for less than 1% of cases
This topic focuses on germ cell testicular cancer.
You can contact the cancer support specialists at Macmillan for more information about Leydig cell tumour and Sertoli cell tumours.
The Macmillan helpline number is 0808 808 00 00, open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm.
Read more about Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
How common is testicular cancer?,"Testicular cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer, accounting for just 1% of all cancers that occur in men.
Around 2,300 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the UK.
Testicular cancer is unusual compared with other cancers because it tends to affect younger men.
Although it's relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men between the ages of 15 and 49.
For reasons that are unclear, white men have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than men from other ethnic groups.
The number of cases of testicular cancer diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear."
Causes of testicular cancer,"The exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man's risk of developing it.
Undescended testicles
Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.
Around 3 to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles do not descend. 
In most cases, testicles that do not descend by the time a boy is a year old descend at a later stage.
If the testicles do not descend naturally, an operation known as an orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.
It's important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys whose testicles descend normally.
It's also much easier to observe the testicles when they're in the scrotum.
Men with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than men whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.
Family history
Having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.
For example, if your father had testicular cancer, you're around 4 times more likely to develop it than someone with no family history of the condition.
If your brother had testicular cancer, you're about 8 times more likely to develop it.
Current research suggests a number of genes may be involved in the development of testicular cancer in families where more than 1 person has had the condition.
This is an ongoing area of research in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.
Previous testicular cancer
Men who have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 12 and 18 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.
For this reason, if you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it's very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.
Find out what testicles should look and feel like
If you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it's very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.
Cancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer risks and causes."
Outlook,"Testicular cancer is 1 of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is 1 of the best for cancers.
In England and Wales, almost all men (99%) survive for a year or more after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, and 98% survive for 5 years or more after diagnosis.
Cancer Research UK has more information about survival rates for testicular cancer.
Almost all men who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it's rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.
Treatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle (orchidectomy or orchiectomy), which does not usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.
In some cases, chemotherapy or, less commonly, radiotherapy may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).

Check if you're at risk of tetanus,"There is a risk of tetanus if soil or manure containing bacteria gets into a wound, such as a bite, burn or scratch.
Tetanus is rare, but the chances of getting it are higher if:
you have not been fully vaccinated (the tetanus vaccine has routinely been given since 1961)
you have a large or deep wound
the wound is very dirty or there is something stuck in the wound
Check with your GP surgery if you’re not sure you’ve been fully vaccinated against tetanus."
Symptoms of tetanus,"The symptoms of tetanus usually start around 4 to 21 days after infection. Most people get symptoms after about 10 days.
The symptoms of tetanus include:
a stiff jaw (lockjaw), which can make opening your mouth difficult
painful muscle spasms, often in your back, tummy, arms, legs, hands and feet
difficulty breathing
swallowing problems
a high temperature
sweating
a fast heartbeat
fits (seizures)"
Treatments for tetanus,"If you have tetanus, or a wound that has a high risk of being infected, you’ll be treated in hospital.
Treatments for tetanus include:
cleaning the wound – any dirt, soil or dead tissue will be removed
an injection with a medicine called tetanus immunoglobulin
other medicines, such as antibiotics and medicines to help control painful muscle spasms and stiffness
help with breathing using a machine that gives you oxygen
You may need a tetanus vaccine or booster if you've not been fully vaccinated (5 doses in total), or if your vaccination history is uncertain.
It can take several weeks or sometimes months to fully recover from tetanus."
How to avoid getting tetanus,"The best way to avoid getting tetanus is to make sure you're fully vaccinated against it.
The tetanus vaccine is given as part of the routine NHS vaccination schedule.
The vaccines are given at:
8, 12 and 16 weeks – as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine
3 years and 4 months – as part of the 4-in-1 pre-school booster
14 years – as part of the 3-in-1 teenage booster
Check with your GP surgery if you’re not sure which vaccinations you or your child has had in the past.
Advice for travellers
Make sure you’re up to date with your routine vaccinations before travelling.
Tetanus vaccinations may be recommended before travelling if:
you're going to an area where it may be difficult to get medical help quickly and your last vaccine dose was more than 10 years ago
you've not been fully vaccinated"
Symptoms of thalassaemia,"Most people born with thalassaemia experience health problems from a few months after birth.
Less severe cases may not be noticeable until later in childhood or even until adulthood.
The main health conditions associated with thalassaemia are:
anaemia – severe tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeats (palpitations) and pale skin caused by the lack of haemoglobin
too much iron in the body – this is caused by the regular blood transfusions used to treat anaemia and can cause problems with the heart, liver and hormone levels if untreated
Some people may also have delayed growth, weak and fragile bones (osteoporosis), and reduced fertility."
Causes of thalassaemia,"Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of haemoglobin.
A child can only be born with thalassaemia if they inherit these faulty genes from both parents.
For example, if both parents have the faulty gene that causes beta thalassaemia major, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with the condition.
The parents of a child with thalassaemia are usually carriers. This means they only have 1 of the faulty genes."
Screening and testing for thalassaemia,"Thalassaemia is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth.
Screening for thalassaemia in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and some types may be picked up during the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test).
Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for thalassaemia or to see if you're a carrier of a faulty gene that causes it."
Treatments for thalassaemia,"People with thalassaemia major or other serious types will need specialist care throughout their lives.
The main treatments are:
blood transfusions – regular blood transfusions treat and prevent anaemia; in severe cases these are needed around once a month
chelation therapy – treatment with medicine to remove the excess iron from the body that builds up as a result of having regular blood transfusions; some people with thalassaemia get a build-up of iron even without transfusions and need treatment for this
Eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol can also help you stay as healthy as possible.
The only possible cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, but this is not done very often because of the risks involved."
Outlook for thalassaemia,"Although the main health problems associated with thalassaemia can often be managed with treatment, it's still a serious health condition that can have a significant impact on a person's life.
Even in mild cases, there's still a risk you could pass on a more serious type to your children.
Without close monitoring and regular treatment, the most severe types can cause serious organ damage and be life threatening.
In the past, severe thalassaemia was often fatal by early adulthood. But with current treatments, people are likely to live into their 50s, 60s and beyond."
Carriers of thalassaemia (having the thalassaemia trait),"A carrier of thalassaemia is someone who carries at least 1 of the faulty genes that causes thalassaemia, but does not have thalassaemia themselves. It's also known as having the thalassaemia trait.
If you're a thalassaemia carrier, you will not develop thalassaemia. Being a carrier will not generally cause you any health problems.
But you may get mild anaemia because your red blood cells are smaller than usual and your haemoglobin level may be slightly lower than normal.
This is not the same as iron deficiency anaemia and does not need any treatment.
If you're a thalassaemia carrier, you're at risk of having a child with thalassaemia if your partner is also a carrier.
You can request a blood test to check if you're a carrier of thalassaemia from your GP surgery."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS),"If you or your child has thalassaemia, your healthcare team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat thalassaemia. You can opt out of the register at any time."
UK Thalassaemia Society,"Finding out as much as possible about thalassaemia may help you feel more in control of your condition.
The UK Thalassaemia Society (UKTS) is the main UK charity for people with thalassaemia.
Its website contains a wide range of useful information, including news about research into the condition."
Check if you have thoracic outlet syndrome,"Thoracic outlet syndrome usually affects 1 arm and hand.
Symptoms include:
pins and needles – this can be worse at night and wake you up
the affected arm gets tired easily
pain and swelling in the affected arm
the affected hand and arm feels cold
the skin on the hand turns blue, grey or pale – this can be harder to see on brown or black skin"
What happens at your appointment,"If you have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, a GP will usually check your arms, chest and neck to look for possible causes of your symptoms.
They may refer you for an X-ray or other tests, such as a CT scan or MRI scan."
Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome,"Thoracic outlet syndrome is usually treated with:
physiotherapy – a physiotherapist can teach you some stretching and strengthening exercises that reduce pressure on nerves and blood vessels
medicines – you may need medicines to help treat pain, relax muscles, improve circulation and reduce your risk of blood clots
Surgery may sometimes be recommended if you're having serious problems (such as blood clots) and other treatments have not worked.
For example, if thoracic outlet syndrome is caused by having an extra rib (cervical rib), surgery to remove it may be recommended."
Causes of thoracic outlet syndrome,"Thoracic outlet syndrome can happen if the nerves or blood vessels running along the top of the rib cage (an area called the thoracic outlet) become squashed.
Things that can lead to thoracic outlet syndrome include:
being born with an extra rib – this is known as a cervical rib
poor posture
having large breasts
an injury to the chest, neck or ribs (such as a car accident)
jobs or activities that involve lots of repetitive arm movements (for example if you're a builder or do lots of swimming)
gaining a lot of muscle (for example, if you're a body builder)"
Check if it's threadworms,"You can spot threadworms in your poo. They look like pieces of white thread.
You might also see them around your child's bottom (anus). The worms usually come out at night while your child is sleeping."
A pharmacist can help with threadworms,"You can buy medicine mebendazole for threadworms from pharmacies. This is usually a chewable tablet or liquid you swallow.
Treat everyone over 2 years old in your household, even if they do not have symptoms.
Tell the pharmacist if you need to treat a child under 2 years old, or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Treatment might not be suitable and you may need to speak to a GP.
If you cannot take medicine you can treat threadworms by using hygiene methods for 6 weeks."
Things you should do at home for threadworms,"Medicine kills the threadworms, but it does not kill the eggs. Eggs can live for up to 2 weeks outside the body.
There are things you can do to stop becoming infected again. Do these for 2 weeks if you’re taking medicine, or for 6 weeks if you’re not taking medicine.
Do
wash hands and scrub under fingernails – particularly before eating, after using the toilet or changing nappies
encourage children to wash hands regularly
shower every morning
rinse toothbrushes before using them
keep fingernails short
wash sleepwear, sheets, towels and soft toys (at a hot temperature) every day for several days after treatment
disinfect kitchen and bathroom surfaces, using hot water
vacuum and dust with a damp cloth
make sure everyone in the household wears underwear at night and changes it in the morning
Don’t
do not shake clothing or bedding, to prevent eggs landing on other surfaces
do not share towels or flannels
do not bite nails or suck thumbs and fingers
Important:
Nursery, school and work
If you or your child has threadworms there's no need to stay off nursery, school or work."
How threadworms spread,"Threadworms spread when their eggs are swallowed. They lay eggs around your bottom (anus), which make it itchy. The eggs get stuck on your fingers when you scratch. They can then pass on to anything you touch, including:
clothes
toys
toothbrushes
kitchen or bathroom surfaces
bedding
food
Eggs can pass to other people when they touch these surfaces and then touch their mouth. The eggs can survive up to 2 weeks. The larvae hatch from the eggs in your gut after you swallow them, and take 1 to 2 months to mature into threadworms.
Children can get threadworms again after they've been treated for them if they get the eggs in their mouth. This is why it's important to encourage children to wash their hands regularly."
What is thrombophilia?,"Your blood forms clots to help stop bleeding. If you have thrombophilia, it means your blood can form clots too easily. Blood clots can be very serious and need to be treated quickly.
Thrombophilia increases your risk of:
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a vein, usually the leg 
pulmonary embolism (PE), a blocked blood vessel in your lungs"
Symptoms of thrombophilia,"Thrombophilia does not have any symptoms.
You only tend to find out you have thrombophilia when you develop a blood clot."
Treatment for thrombophilia,"You do not usually need treatment for thrombophilia. You usually only need treatment if you have a blood clot, such as DVT or PE.
Blood clots are usually treated in the same way, whether or not you have thrombophilia.
The main treatment for blood clots is anticoagulant medicine.
If you're at high risk of blood clots, you may need to take this medicine regularly for several months or years.
There's an increased risk of blood clots during pregnancy with some types of thrombophilia. Speak to your GP or midwife if you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant and you have thrombophilia."
Types of thrombophilia,"There are many types of thrombophilia. Some types run in families and others develop later on in life.
Common types of thrombophilia include:
factor V Leiden
protein C deficiency
protein S deficiency
antithrombin deficiency
antiphospholipid syndrome"
Check if you have thrush,"Thrush symptoms in women
Symptoms of thrush in women include:
white vaginal discharge (often like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell
itching and irritation around the vulva and vagina
soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee
Thrush symptoms in men
Symptoms of thrush in men include:
irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
a white discharge (like cottage cheese)
an unpleasant smell
difficulty pulling back the foreskin
Thrush in other areas
Thrush can affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, groin and between the fingers.
This usually causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with white or yellow discharge. The rash may not be so obvious on darker skin.
Sometimes thrush causes no symptoms at all."
What happens at your appointment,"The GP will want to confirm it's thrush and rule out other infections.
You'll be asked about your symptoms.
If it's not clear it's thrush or if you have thrush that keeps coming back:
a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina, penis or skin
a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge to check what's causing your symptoms and to test for other infections"
Thrush treatment,"You'll usually need antifungal medicine to get rid of thrush. This can be a tablet you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary) or a cream to relieve the irritation.
Thrush should clear up within 7 to 14 days of starting treatment.
You do not need to treat partners unless they have symptoms.
Recurring thrush
You might need to take treatment for longer (up to 6 months) if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).
Before you begin treatment, a GP can help identify if something is causing your thrush, such as your period or sex.
They'll recommend how often you should use treatment."
Things you can do yourself to ease discomfort and prevent thrush returning,"There are things you can do to ease thrush and stop it coming back.
Do
use water and an emollient (like E45 cream) instead of soap to wash the affected area
dry properly after washing
wear cotton underwear
avoid sex until thrush has cleared up if sex is uncomfortable
Don’t
do not use soaps or shower gels
do not use douches or deodorants on your vagina or penis
do not wear tight underwear or tights
Important
If you have sex during treatment, be aware that antifungal creams can damage condoms and diaphragms. This means your contraception might not work.
A pharmacist can help with thrush
You can buy antifungal medicine from pharmacies if you've had thrush diagnosed in the past and you know the symptoms.
A pharmacist can recommend the best treatment for you. Ask if they have a private area to talk if you're embarrassed.
You should not use antifungal medicine more than twice in 6 months without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.
Find a pharmacy"
What causes thrush,"Thrush is not classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be triggered by sex.
Thrush is caused by a fungus called candida that is normally harmless.
Thrush tends to grow in warm, moist conditions and develops if the balance of bacteria changes.
This can happen if:
your skin is irritated or damaged
you're taking antibiotics
you have poorly controlled diabetes
you have a weakened immune system (for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy)
you're having hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
you're pregnant"
How you can ease thumb pain yourself,"If you see a GP about pain in your thumb, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your thumb when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your thumb for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
take paracetamol
take off any jewellery if your thumb looks swollen
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
wear a splint to support your thumb and ease pain, especially at night – you can get these at most pharmacies and supermarkets
consider taping something like a lollipop stick to your thumb – this will keep it in place until you can get a splint
consider using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
keep your thumb moving with gentle exercises
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
A pharmacist can help with thumb pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
the best splint to support your thumb and ease pain – flexible rubber splints are available if you still need to use your thumb
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Common causes of thumb pain,"Thumb pain is often caused by bruising or injuring your thumb.
Your symptoms might also give you an idea of what's causing the pain in your thumb.
Common causes of thumb pain and related symptoms.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain, swelling, bruising after an injury Sprained thumb
Pain, swelling and stiffness at the base of the thumb that lasts a long time, may be hard to move your thumb, may have a lump Tendonitis (de Quervain's disease) or arthritis
Aching pain that's worse at night, numbness or pins and needles, a weak thumb or difficulty gripping Carpal tunnel syndrome
Pain or tenderness in your palm at the base of your thumb, stiffness, clicking when you move your finger or thumb Trigger thumb
Sudden, sharp pain, swelling, a popping or snapping sound during the injury Broken thumb"
Symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"The main symptoms of a TIA can be remembered with the word FAST:
Face – the face may have dropped on 1 side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped.
Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them raised because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm.
Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake; they may also have problems understanding what you're saying to them.
Time – it's time to call 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms."
When to get medical advice,"In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you're having a TIA or a full stroke.
It's important to call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else has symptoms of a TIA or stroke.
Even if the symptoms disappear while you're waiting for an ambulance to arrive, you still need to be assessed in hospital.
You should be referred to see a specialist within 24 hours of the onset of your symptoms.
A TIA is a warning sign that you may be at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors determine the best way to reduce the chances of that happening.
If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have passed and you did not seek medical advice at the time, make an urgent appointment with a GP. 
They can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment."
Causes of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"During a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 1 of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked.
This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that's formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles.
Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including:
smoking
high blood pressure (hypertension)
obesity
high cholesterol levels
regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol
having a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation
having diabetes
People over 55 years of age and people of Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA."
Treating a transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"Although the symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resolve in a few minutes or hours, you'll need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future.
Treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history.
You're likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk, and be offered medicine to treat the cause of the TIA.
In some cases, a surgery called a carotid endarterectomy may be needed to unblock your carotid arteries, which are the main blood vessels that supply your brain with blood."
Preventing a transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is often a sign that another one may follow and you're at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future.
Regardless of whether you have had a TIA or stroke in the past, there are several ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future.
These include:
maintaining a healthy weight
eating a healthy, balanced diet
doing regular exercise
limiting alcohol
not smoking"
Check if you could be at risk of tick-borne encephalitis,"The risk of getting tick-borne encephalitis is very low.
Ticks that spread it can be found in:
most of Europe – including the UK
Russia
parts of China and Japan
Ticks live in woodlands and grassy areas, but they can also be found in some parks and gardens.
In the UK, only a very small number of ticks carry the TBE virus. Even if you're bitten by a tick, the risk of getting seriously ill is very low."
How to reduce your risk of tick-borne encephalitis,"There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting tick-borne encephalitis in the UK and abroad.
Avoiding tick bites
To reduce your risk of being bitten by a tick when you’re outside:
regularly check your clothes and skin for ticks that might be crawling on you and brush them off before they can bite you – wear light coloured clothing so it’s easier to spot any ticks
walk on clearly defined paths to avoid brushing against plants that may have ticks on them
use an insect repellent such as DEET on your skin – you can also get clothes that contain insect repellent
wear long trousers and long-sleeved tops so it's harder for ticks to bite you
Ticks can sometimes be very small and hard to spot. They get bigger if they bite you and feed on your blood.

Removing a tick that has bitten you
If you're bitten by a tick, try to remove it as soon as possible.
To remove a tick safely:
Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool (you can buy these from some pharmacies, vets and pet shops).
Grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible and pull upwards slowly and firmly, as mouthparts left in the skin can cause a skin infection.
Take care not to squeeze or crush the tick. Dispose of it when you have removed it.
Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water.
Credit:
The risk of getting ill following a tick bite is low. You do not need to seek medical attention unless you become unwell.
Important
Tick bites are usually painless. You may not notice a tick unless you see it on your skin.
Always check your skin and hair after being outdoors.
Vaccine for travellers
Consider having the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine if you're visiting a country where the infection is common and you're planning to do outdoor activities when you get there.
2 injections of the vaccine can protect you for about a year. A 3rd injection can protect you for about 3 years.
You need to have the first injection at least 1 month before travelling.
The vaccine is not available on the NHS. Search online for a travel clinic that offers it. It costs about £65 per injection."
Symptoms of tick-borne encephalitis,"The virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis does not cause symptoms in most people.
Some people get flu-like symptoms about a week after being bitten, such as:
a high temperature
tiredness
a headache
aches and pains
feeling sick
The symptoms usually go away on their own, but in a few people the infection spreads to the brain and causes more serious symptoms a few days or weeks later.
These can include:
a stiff neck and a severe headache
pain when looking at bright lights
a fit (seizure)
a change in behaviour, confusion or slurred speech
weakness or loss of movement in part of the body"
Types of tics,"There are many types of tic. Some affect body movement (motor tics) and others result in a sound (vocal or phonic tics).
Examples of tics include:
blinking, wrinkling the nose or grimacing
jerking or banging the head
clicking the fingers
touching other people or things
coughing, grunting or sniffing
repeating a sound or phrase – in a small number of cases, this may be something obscene or offensive
Tics can happen randomly and they may be associated with something such as stress, anxiety, tiredness, excitement or happiness. They tend to get worse if they're talked about or focused on.
They often start with an unpleasant sensation that builds up in the body until relieved by the tic – known as an urge – although they can sometimes be partly suppressed."
When to see a GP,"Tics are not usually serious and they do not damage the brain.
You do not always need to see a GP if they're mild and not causing problems. Sometimes they can disappear as quickly as they appear.
See a GP if you're concerned about your or your child's tics, you need support or advice, or the tics:
occur very regularly, or become more frequent or severe
cause emotional or social problems, such as embarrassment, bullying or social isolation
cause pain or discomfort (some tics can cause the person to accidentally hurt themselves)
interfere with daily activities, school or work
are accompanied by anger, depression or self harm
A GP should be able to diagnose a tic from a description of it and, if possible, seeing it. Recording a short video can be helpful, but be careful not to draw too much attention to the tic while filming as this can make it worse."
Treatments for tics,"Treatment is not always needed if a tic is mild and is not causing any other problems. Self-help tips, such as avoiding stress or tiredness, are often very helpful for the majority of people.
If a tic is more severe and is affecting everyday activities, therapies that aim to reduce how often tics occur may be recommended.
The main therapies for tics are:
Habit reversal therapy – this aims to help you or your child learn intentional movements that ""compete"" with tics, so the tic cannot happen at the same time
Comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics (CBiT) – a set of behavioural techniques to help learn skills to reduce tics
Exposure with response prevention (ERP) – this aims to help you or your child get used to the unpleasant sensations that are often felt just before a tic, which can stop the tic occurring
There are also medicines that can help reduce tics. These may be used alongside psychological therapies or after trying these therapies unsuccessfully.
Read more about how tics are treated."
How long do tics last?,"In most cases, tics improve over time or stop completely.
Sometimes they may just last a few months, but often they come and go over several years.
They are normally most severe from around 8 years of age until teenage years, and usually start to improve after puberty."
Causes of tics,"It's not clear what causes tics. They're thought to be due to changes in the parts of the brain that control movement.
They can run in families, and there's likely to be a genetic cause in many cases. They also often happen alongside other conditions, such as:
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
Tics can sometimes be triggered by taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, and are occasionally caused by more serious health conditions such as cerebral palsy or Huntington's disease."
Check if you have tinnitus,"Tinnitus can sound like:
ringing
buzzing
whooshing
humming
hissing
throbbing
music or singing
You may hear these sounds in 1 or both ears, or in your head. They may come and go, or you might hear them all the time."
Causes of tinnitus,"It's not always clear what causes tinnitus, but it's often linked to:
some form of hearing loss
Ménière's disease
conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders or multiple sclerosis
anxiety or depression
taking certain medicines – tinnitus can be a side effect of some chemotherapy medicines, antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin"
What happens at your appointment,"The GP will look in your ears to see if your tinnitus is caused by something they can treat, like an ear infection or a build-up of earwax.
They might also check for any hearing loss.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment."
Things you can try to help cope with tinnitus,"If you have tinnitus there are things you can do to help cope.
Do
try to relax – deep breathing or yoga may help
try to find ways to improve your sleep, such as sticking to a bedtime routine or cutting down on caffeine
try to avoid things that can make tinnitus worse, such as stress or loud background noises
join a support group – talking to other people with tinnitus may help you cope
Don’t
do not have total silence – listening to soft music or sounds (called sound therapy) may distract you from the tinnitus
do not focus on it, as this can make it worse – hobbies and activities may take your mind off it"
Treatments for tinnitus,"If the cause of your tinnitus is unknown or cannot be treated, your GP or specialist may refer you for a type of talking therapy.
This could be:
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – to change the way you think about your tinnitus and reduce anxiety
tinnitus counselling – to help you learn about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it
tinnitus retraining therapy – using sound therapy to retrain your brain to tune out and be less aware of the tinnitus
You'll usually be offered digital CBT first, which is a type of CBT that's delivered through an online programme or app on your computer, tablet or smartphone.
Tinnitus retraining therapy may be available on the NHS for people with severe or persistent tinnitus. It's unclear if tinnitus retraining therapy works for everyone. It's widely available privately.
If you have hearing loss, hearing aids may be recommended."
Causes of tiredness and fatigue,"Common causes of tiredness and fatigue include:
not getting enough sleep or finding it hard to get to sleep (insomnia)
an unhealthy lifestyle (such as having an unhealthy diet and not getting much exercise)
stress, depression and dealing with life challenges, such as bereavement or looking after a new baby
hormonal changes (such as during puberty, pregnancy or the menopause)
some illnesses, like glandular fever and COVID-19
some medical treatments and medicines, like chemotherapy, which can cause drowsiness for a while
But if you cannot explain why you're tired and it's been going on for a while and not getting any better, it may be a sign of a medical condition.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing your tiredness or fatigue. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Conditions that can cause tiredness and fatigue
Symptoms Possible cause
Tired during the day because of waking up at night, making gasping, snorting or choking noises at night and loud snoring
Sleep apnoea
Lack of energy, noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations), shortness of breath and pale skin
Iron deficiency anaemia
Very tired, feeling very thirsty, peeing more often than usual (particularly at night), weight loss
Diabetes
Tired all the time, finding it hard to stay still, feeling nervous, anxious and irritable, muscle weakness
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
Extreme fatigue for at least 3 months (making it very hard to do daily activities), problems with thinking, memory and concentration, flu-like symptoms
Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)"
Things you can do to help with tiredness or fatigue,"There may be things you can do to help with your tiredness or fatigue.
Do
have a healthy diet and exercise regularly
try to stick to the same sleep times and aim for 6 to 9 hours of sleep
try to relax a couple of hours before your sleep time (read, or listen to music or a podcast)
have a relaxing sleeping area (not too bright, noisy or warm)
Don’t
do not smoke
do not drink too much alcohol
do not eat, have caffeine or exercise in the couple of hours before sleep
do not use smartphones or screens in the hour before sleep"
Treatment for tiredness or fatigue,"Treatment for tiredness or fatigue depends on the cause.
Possible treatments include:
talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
advice on how to get better sleep
advice on how to relax or change your lifestyle
A GP may refer you to a specialist if they do not know the cause of your tiredness or fatigue.
You may need tests, such as blood tests to check for anaemia, diabetes or hyperthyroidism."
How to ease toe pain yourself,"If you see a GP about toe pain, they'll usually suggest trying these things:
Do
rest and raise your foot when you can
put an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your toe for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
wear wide comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
buddy strap a broken toe – put a small piece of cotton wool or gauze between your sore toe and the next toe, and use tape to loosely strap it up (do not do this for a big toe or a badly broken toe)
try regular gentle stretching exercises
Don’t
do not walk or stand for long periods
do not wear high heels or tight pointy shoes
A pharmacist can help with toe pain
If you have toe pain, a pharmacist can advise you about:
the best painkiller to take
insoles and pads for your shoes
treatments for common skin and nail problems
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of toe pain,"A sore toe is often caused by exercising too much or wearing shoes that are too tight.
Your symptoms might also give you an idea of what's causing your toe pain.
Some of the possible causes of toe pain.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain or swelling around the nail, nail curls into the toe Ingrown toe nail
Hard bony lump near the big toe Bunion
Pain, tingling and numbness when you're cold or stressed, toes can change colour Raynaud's or chilblains
Pain, swelling, red or bruised toe, hurts to walk Broken toe
Sudden pain, stiffness, red or hot swollen skin around the toe joint Gout"
Signs of tongue-tie,"To breastfeed successfully, a baby needs to latch on to both the breast tissue and nipple, and their tongue needs to cover the lower gum so the nipple is protected from damage.
Some babies with tongue-tie are not able to open their mouths wide enough to latch on to the breast properly.
If you're breastfeeding your baby and they have tongue-tie they may:
have difficulty attaching to the breast or staying attached for a full feed
feed for a long time, have a short break, then feed again
be unsettled and seem to be hungry all the time
not gain weight as quickly as they should
make a ""clicking"" sound as they feed – this can also be a sign you need support with the positioning and attachment of your baby at the breast
Tongue-tie can also sometimes cause problems for a breastfeeding mother. Problems can include:
sore or cracked nipples
low milk supply
mastitis (inflammation of the breast), which may keep coming back
Most breastfeeding problems, however, are not caused by tongue-tie and can be overcome with the right support.
If you're finding breastfeeding difficult, ask a midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist for help."
Treating tongue-tie,"Treatment is not always needed, if your baby has tongue-tie but can feed without any problems. If their feeding is affected, treatment involves a simple procedure called tongue-tie division.
Tongue-tie division
Tongue-tie division involves cutting the short, tight piece of skin connecting the underside of the tongue to the bottom of the mouth.
It's a quick, simple and almost painless procedure that usually improves feeding straight away.
The procedure
Tongue-tie division is done by doctors, nurses or midwives.
In very young babies (those who are only a few months old), it is usually done without anaesthetic (painkilling medicine).
The procedure does not seem to hurt babies. This is because there are very few nerve endings in the area around the bottom of the mouth. Some babies sleep through the procedure, while others may cry a bit.
A general anaesthetic is usually needed for older babies with teeth, which means they'll be unconscious throughout the procedure.
The baby's head is held securely while sharp, sterile scissors with blunt ends are used to cut the skin.
It only takes a few seconds, and you can start feeding your baby immediately afterwards.
There should not be much bleeding. Your baby may get a white patch (ulcer) under their tongue, but this should heal in 1 to 2 days. It will not bother your baby.
Research suggests most babies who have treatment for tongue-tie find breastfeeding easier afterwards.
The Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners (ATP) can help you find a tongue-tie practitioner."
Older children and adults,"Untreated tongue-tie may not cause any problems as a child gets older, and any tightness may resolve naturally as the mouth develops.
However, tongue-tie can sometimes cause problems such as speech difficulties and difficulty eating certain foods.
Speak to a GP if you think you or your child are having problems caused by tongue-tie.
Tongue-tie division can be carried out in older children and adults, although it's usually done under general anaesthetic."
Check if you have tooth decay,"Tooth decay may not cause any symptoms at first.
But if it gets worse it can lead to problems, such as a hole forming in the tooth (dental cavity).
If you have a hole in your tooth you may have:
toothache (tooth pain)
sharp pain in your tooth when eating or drinking hot, cold or sweet things (sensitive teeth)
white, brown or black spots on your tooth
Sometimes the tooth or gum can become infected, leading to a painful build-up of pus (dental abscess)."
Treatments for tooth decay,"Treatment for tooth decay depends on how severe it is.
A dentist can prescribe fluoride treatments like mouthwash or varnish to reverse early tooth decay.
You'll probably need a filling if you have a hole (cavity) in your tooth.
If tooth decay has reached the soft tissue (pulp) in the middle of your tooth, you may need root canal treatment.
Sometimes the affected tooth may need to be removed (extraction)."
Preventing tooth decay,"Tooth decay happens when bacteria create a sticky layer called plaque over your teeth. This damages the surface of your teeth over time.
Tooth decay is common in children, so it's important to make sure they're looking after their teeth and gums from an early age.
There are some simple things you can do to keep your and your children's teeth and gums healthy and help prevent tooth decay.
Do
brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste – spit after brushing, do not rinse
clean in between your teeth every day using floss or interdental brushes
use sugar-free medicines
have regular dental check-ups (your dentist will be able to advise you about how often you need to go)
Don’t
do not have too much sugary food or drink
do not smoke"
Symptoms of Tourette's syndrome,"Tics are the main symptom of Tourette's syndrome. They usually appear in childhood between the ages of 2 and 14 (around 6 years is the average).
People with Tourette's syndrome have a combination of physical and vocal tics.
Examples of physical tics include:
blinking
eye rolling
grimacing
shoulder shrugging
jerking of the head or limbs
jumping
twirling
touching objects and other people
Examples of vocal tics include:
grunting
throat clearing
whistling
coughing
tongue clicking
animal sounds
saying random words and phrases
repeating a sound, word or phrase
swearing
Swearing is rare and only affects about 1 in 10 people with Tourette's syndrome.
Tics are not usually harmful to a person's overall health, but physical tics, such as jerking of the head, can be painful.
Tics can be worse on some days than others.
They may be worse during periods of:
stress
anxiety
tiredness
People with Tourette's syndrome can have mood and behavioural problems, such as:
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
depression or anxiety
Children with Tourette's syndrome may also be at risk of bullying because their tics might single them out.
Premonitory sensations
Most people with Tourette's syndrome experience a strong urge before a tic, which has been compared to the feeling you get before needing to itch or sneeze.
These feelings are known as premonitory sensations. Premonitory sensations are only relieved after the tic has been carried out.
Examples of premonitory sensations include:
a burning feeling in the eyes before blinking
a dry or sore throat before grunting
an itchy joint or muscle before jerking
Controlling tics
Some people can control their tics for a short while in certain social situations, like in a classroom. It requires concentration, but gets easier with practise.
Controlling tics can be tiring. A person may have a sudden release of tics after a day trying to control them, like after returning home from school.
Tics may be less noticeable during activities involving a high level of concentration, such as reading an interesting book or playing sports."
When to get medical advice,"You should contact a GP if you or your child start having tics.
Many children have tics for several months before growing out of them, so a tic does not necessarily mean your child has Tourette's syndrome."
Diagnosing Tourette's syndrome,"There's no single test for Tourette's syndrome. Tests and scans, such as an MRI scan, may be used to rule out other conditions.
You can be diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome if you've had several tics for at least a year.
Getting a firm diagnosis can help you and others understand your condition better, and give you access to the right kind of treatment and support.
To get a diagnosis, a GP may refer you to different specialists, such as a neurologist (a brain and nervous system specialist)."
Treating Tourette's syndrome,"There's no cure for Tourette's syndrome and most children with tics do not need treatment for them.
Treatment may sometimes be recommended to help you control your tics.
Treatment is usually available on the NHS and can involve:
behavioural therapy
medicine
Behavioural therapy
Behavioural therapy is usually provided by a psychologist or a specially trained therapist.
2 types of behavioural therapy have been shown to reduce tics:
habit reversal training – this approach involves working out the feelings that trigger tics; the next stage is to find an alternative, less noticeable way of relieving the urge to tic
exposure with response prevention (ERP) – this method trains you to better control your urge to tic; techniques are used to recreate the urge to tic to train you to tolerate the feeling, without doing the tic, until the urge passes
Medicine
Some people's tics are helped with medicines, but this is usually only recommended if the tics are more severe or affecting daily activities.
Medicines for Tourette's syndrome can have side effects and they will not work for everyone."
Causes of Tourette's syndrome,"The cause of Tourette's syndrome is unknown. It's thought to be linked to a part of the brain that helps regulate body movements.
For unknown reasons, boys are more likely to be affected by Tourette's syndrome than girls."
Further help and support,"For more information about treatment and support, contact the charity Tourettes Action."
Check if you have toxic shock syndrome,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) can come on quickly.
Symptoms include:
a high temperature
muscle aches
a raised skin rash that feels like sandpaper
flu-like symptoms"
What causes toxic shock syndrome,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare infection.
It's possible to get TSS:
from using tampons or menstrual cups
from a contraceptive diaphragm or cap
after a vaginal birth or caesarean section
from a cut, wound, boil or burn that has become infected
Your chances of getting TSS are higher if you've had it before."
Treatments for toxic shock syndrome,"You'll need urgent hospital treatment for toxic shock syndrome (TSS).
Treatment can include:
antibiotics to treat the infection
fluids to rehydrate you, usually through a drip in your arm
medicine to help control your blood pressure
oxygen
surgery to remove infection from cuts or wounds"
How to prevent toxic shock syndrome,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is rare, but there are things you can do to reduce your chance of catching or spreading a bacterial infection.
Do
wash your hands and follow the instructions when using tampons, menstrual cups, contraceptive caps and diaphragms, and do not leave them in longer than needed or recommended
keep cuts and burns clean, and look out for signs of infection, such as a rash, swelling or pain
If you've had TSS before, your doctor may advise you not to use tampons, contraceptive caps or diaphragms."
How you get toxocariasis,"Toxocariasis is caused by worms found in some dog, cat and fox poo.
Animals with these worms in their digestive system can pass out worm eggs in their poo. You can become infected if poo, soil or sand containing these eggs gets in your mouth.
Toxocariasis is not caught from fresh poo. It's usually caught from soil or sand that has contained worm eggs for a few weeks or months.
Toxocariasis cannot be spread between people."
Is toxocariasis serious?,"Most people who swallow the worm eggs that cause toxocariasis do not become ill.
The worms can spread to parts of the body such as the liver, lungs or eyes, where they usually die without causing any problems.
But rarely, they can cause serious problems like difficulty breathing or loss of vision."
Symptoms of toxocariasis,"Toxocariasis only causes symptoms if the worms spread in your body.
Depending on where the worms spread, symptoms can include:
a high temperature
coughing or wheezing
stomach ache
an itchy rash
eye pain or redness
changes to your sight, such as seeing small dots or lines (floaters) or flashes of light
loss of vision (usually in 1 eye)"
Treatment for toxocariasis,"Toxocariasis only needs to be treated if it causes symptoms.
The main treatment is medicine to kill the worms.
If the worms spread to your eye, steroid medicine may be used to help stop damage to your eye. Sometimes you may also need surgery to remove the worms or treat any problems with your vision."
How to reduce the risk of toxocariasis,"Although toxocariasis is rare, there are some simple things you can do to reduce the risk of getting it and help stop pets spreading it.
Do
wash your hands regularly, especially before eating
wear gloves when gardening
teach young children not to eat soil or sand
wash vegetables before eating them
pick up and bin dog and cat poo quickly
make sure pet dogs and cats are de-wormed regularly
Don’t
do not let animals poo in places where children play, such as sandboxes or playgrounds
do not let children play in places where there might be lots of animal poo"
Check if you have toxoplasmosis,"Toxoplasmosis does not usually cause any symptoms and most people do not know they've had it.
Some people may have flu-like symptoms such as:
high temperature
headache
sore throat
aching body
swollen glands
feeling tired
feeling sick or being sick
Some people may have more serious symptoms including:
confusion
blurred vision
slurred speech
unsteady walking"
Risks of toxoplasmosis,"Toxoplasmosis is not usually serious and normally gets better on its own.
But it can cause serious problems if you:
get it while you’re pregnant
have a weakened immune system – for example, if you have HIV or are having chemotherapy
have more severe symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision or slurred speech
If you get toxoplasmosis while you're pregnant it can cause miscarriage. If it spreads to your baby it can cause serious complications.
If you have a weakened immune system toxoplasmosis may cause problems with your eyes, brain, heart or lungs."
What happens at your GP appointment,"The GP may do blood tests to see if you've been infected with toxoplasmosis. They can also prescribe medicines to treat the infection if necessary.
If you're pregnant and you test positive for toxoplasmosis, the GP can refer you for more tests to see if your baby has been infected. This is very rare."
Treatment for toxoplasmosis,"Most people who get toxoplasmosis get better without treatment.
However, you’ll usually be given medicines, including antibiotics, if you:
are pregnant
have a weakened immune system, for example, you’re taking immunosuppressant medicines or you have HIV
have symptoms affecting your eyes
Newborn babies with toxoplasmosis are also treated with antibiotics and sometimes other medicines to treat the symptoms.
If you’re seriously ill, you may need to be treated in hospital."
How to prevent toxoplasmosis,"The parasite that causes toxoplasmosis can be found in the poo of infected cats, and in undercooked meat. You can also catch it from soil that's been contaminated by cat poo.
There are things you can do if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system to help you avoid toxoplasmosis.
Do
wear gloves while gardening, and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards
wash your hands before preparing food and eating
wash hands, knives and chopping boards thoroughly after preparing raw meat
wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly to get rid of any traces of soil
thoroughly cook meat, especially lamb, pork and venison
avoid cat poo in cat litter and soil if you can, wearing gloves if you need to empty cat litter trays and washing your hands afterwards
Don’t
do not eat raw or undercooked meat, or cured meats like salami or parma ham
do not have unpasteurised goats' milk or any products made from it
do not touch pregnant sheep or lambs
do not feed cats raw or undercooked meat
Important
You cannot catch toxoplasmosis from stroking a cat, having a cat as a pet or from coming into contact with someone who's got it."
Why a tracheostomy is done,"Reasons you may need to have a tracheostomy include:
to help you breathe if your throat is blocked
to remove excess fluid and mucus from your lungs
to deliver oxygen from a machine called a ventilator to your lungs
A tracheostomy is often planned in advance, but sometimes it needs to be done as soon as possible in an emergency.
If you need a tracheostomy but are unable to give your consent, it will be discussed with your family."
What happens during a tracheostomy,"A tracheostomy is usually done under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation and will not feel any pain.
If it needs to be done in an emergency, you'll have a local anaesthetic, where you'll be awake but your neck will be numb.
The surgeon makes a cut in the skin at the front of your neck and creates a small hole in your windpipe.
A tracheostomy tube is inserted through the hole and into your windpipe. It's held in place by a piece of tape around your neck.
You breathe through the tracheostomy tube rather than through your nose and mouth.
After the operation
You'll need to stay in hospital for a while after having a tracheostomy. How long depends on why you had the procedure and your recovery.
Some people only need a tracheostomy for a few days, while others need it for much longer.
If you're able to go home with a tracheostomy, you or the person looking after you will be shown how to clean and care for it before you leave hospital. You'll also be given help and support after you've left."
After having a tracheostomy,"It may take a while to get used to having a tracheostomy.
Speaking
Tracheostomy tubes often have an air-filled cuff around them. You will not be able to speak when the cuff is inflated.
To begin with, you may need to communicate using writing and gestures.
As you recover, air will gradually be removed from the cuff and you'll be able to start to speak.
A speaking valve is sometimes fitted to the tracheostomy tube, which can help make your voice stronger.
Eating and drinking
You may be able to eat and drink with a tracheostomy.
But if you cannot swallow, you may need to have a thin feeding tube inserted through your nose and down into your stomach.
This allows liquid food and fluids to be given to you directly.
Changing your tracheostomy tube
Your tracheostomy tube may need to be changed if it's been in for 28 days or you need a different tube to help with your breathing and talking.
Changing the tube is a quick and simple procedure that's usually done in hospital.
Removing your tracheostomy tube
Your tracheostomy tube will be removed when you no longer need help breathing. This might be a few days or weeks, but some people need it for longer.
A dressing will be put over the hole after the tube has been removed. The hole usually takes about 7 to 10 days to heal.
You may have some pain or discomfort in the area where the tube was, but this should improve as the hole heals.
You'll also have a small scar on your neck, but it will fade over time."
Risks and complications of a tracheostomy,"A tracheostomy is a common procedure, but as with any type of surgery there are risks and possible complications.
Your doctor will discuss these with you before you agree to have a planned tracheostomy.
Risks of a tracheostomy include:
bleeding in or around the tracheostomy
damage to the windpipe or area around it
the tracheostomy tube becoming blocked or moving out of place
problems with the hole healing after the tube is removed, such as it becoming infected
a build-up of air between your lungs and chest wall, which can cause pain, difficulty breathing or a collapsed lung in severe cases"
Why TURP is carried out,"TURP is often recommended when prostate enlargement causes troublesome symptoms and fails to respond to treatment with medication.
Symptoms that may improve after TURP include:
problems with starting to pee
a weak flow of pee, or stopping and starting
having to strain to pee
a frequent need to pee
waking up frequently during the night to pee
a sudden urge to pee
being unable to empty your bladder fully"
How TURP is performed,"TURP is carried out using a device called a resectoscope, which is a thin metal tube containing a light, camera and loop of wire. This is passed along your urethra until it reaches your prostate, which means no cuts (incisions) need to be made in your skin.
The loop of wire is then heated with an electric current and used to cut away the section of your prostate causing your symptoms. A thin tube called a catheter is then inserted into your urethra to pump fluid into the bladder and flush away pieces of prostate that have been removed.
General or spinal anaesthesia is used during the procedure so you don't feel any pain while it's carried out."
Recovering from TURP,"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for 1 to 3 days after your operation, although at some hospitals you can go home on the same day.
The catheter used during the operation will usually be taken out between 1 day and 1 week afterwards.
It's common to feel tired and under the weather for a week or two after going home. Most men are up and about after this time, but you'll need to take things easy for 3 to 4 weeks.
You'll usually be advised to stay off work and avoid lifting heavy objects, doing strenuous exercise, driving and having sex for at least a few weeks.
It's normal to have some difficulties peeing and some blood in your pee for a few weeks. These problems should get better as you recover, but you should contact the hospital clinic or your GP if you're concerned."
What are the risks?,"In most cases, TURP is a safe procedure and the risk of serious complications is very small.
However, many men who have a TURP lose the ability to ejaculate semen during sex or masturbation, although they still have physical pleasure from ejaculation (orgasm). This is known as retrograde ejaculation.
Some men also lose the ability to control their bladder (urinary incontinence), although this usually passes in a few weeks. In rare cases, it may be persistent and need further treatment.
There's also a small risk of problems such as erectile dysfunction, difficulties passing urine and urinary tract infections (UTIs)."
Alternatives to TURP,"There are a number of alternatives to TURP that can be just as effective with a lower risk of complications.
They include:
PLASMA system – electrodes are put into the prostrate through the urethra and are used to cut out prostate tissue
holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) – a laser attached to a resectoscope is used to cut away excess prostate tissue
transurethral laser resection or vaporisation of the prostate – a thin tube called a cystoscope is inserted into the urethra and a laser attached to the cystoscope fires pulses of energy to burn away prostate tissue
prostatic urethral lift (PUL) implants – a surgeon inserts implants that hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so that the urethra is not blocked; this helps to relieve symptoms like pain or difficulty when peeing
These procedures aren't suitable for all men with prostate enlargement. Your doctor will discuss your options with you."
When should I start thinking about the vaccines I need?,"If possible, see the GP or a private travel clinic at least 6 to 8 weeks before you're due to travel.
Some vaccines need to be given well in advance to allow your body to develop immunity.
And some vaccines involve a number of doses spread over several weeks or months.
You may be more at risk of some diseases, for example, if you're:
travelling in rural areas
backpacking
staying in hostels or camping
on a long trip rather than a package holiday
If you have a pre-existing health problem, this may make you more at risk of infection or complications from a travel-related illness."
Which travel vaccines do I need?,"You can find out which vaccinations are necessary or recommended for the areas you'll be visiting on these websites:
Travel Health Pro
NHS Fit for Travel
Some countries require proof of vaccination (for example, for polio or yellow fever vaccination), which must be documented on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) before you enter or when you leave a country.
Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination against certain types of meningitis for visitors arriving for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages.
Even if an ICVP is not required, it's still a good idea to take a record of the vaccinations you have had with you.
Find out more about the vaccines available for travellers abroad"
Where do I get my travel vaccines?,"First, phone or visit the GP practice or practice nurse to find out whether your existing UK vaccinations are up-to-date.
If you have any records of your vaccinations, let the GP know what you have had previously.
The GP or practice nurse may be able to give you general advice about travel vaccinations and travel health, such as protecting yourself from malaria.
They can give you any missing doses of your UK vaccines if you need them.
Not all travel vaccinations are available free on the NHS, even if they're recommended for travel to a certain area.
If the GP practice can give you the travel vaccines you need but they are not available on the NHS, ask for:
written information on what vaccines are needed
the cost of each dose or course
any other charges you may have to pay, such as for some certificates of vaccination
You can also get travel vaccines from:
private travel vaccination clinics
pharmacies offering travel healthcare services"
Which travel vaccines are free?,"The following travel vaccines are available free on the NHS from your GP surgery:
polio (given as a combined diphtheria/tetanus/polio jab)
typhoid
hepatitis A
cholera
These vaccines are free because they protect against diseases thought to represent the greatest risk to public health if they were brought into the country."
Which travel vaccines will I have to pay for?,"You'll have to pay for travel vaccinations against:
hepatitis B
Japanese encephalitis
meningitis
rabies
tick-borne encephalitis
tuberculosis (TB)
yellow fever
Yellow fever vaccines are only available from designated centres.
The cost of travel vaccines that are not available on the NHS will vary, depending on the vaccine and number of doses you need.
It's worth considering this when budgeting for your trip."
Other things to consider,"There are other things to consider when planning your travel vaccinations, including:
your age and health – you may be more vulnerable to infection than others; some vaccines cannot be given to people with certain medical conditions
working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster
working in a medical setting – a doctor, nurse or another healthcare worker may require additional vaccinations
contact with animals – you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies
If you're only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you're unlikely to need any vaccinations.
But it's important to check that you're up-to-date with routine vaccinations available on the NHS."
Pregnancy and breastfeeding,"Speak to a GP before having any vaccinations if:
you're pregnant
you think you might be pregnant
you're breastfeeding
In many cases, it's unlikely a vaccine given while you're pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby.
But the GP will be able to give you further advice about this."
People with immune deficiencies,"For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised.
This may be the case if:
you have a condition that affects your body's immune system, such as HIV or AIDS
you're receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy
you have recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant
A GP can give you further advice about this."
Non-travel vaccines,"As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it's also a good opportunity to make sure your other UK vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster vaccines if necessary.
If you have any records of your vaccinations, let the GP know what you have had previously.
People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines.
These include vaccinations against diseases such as:
hepatitis B
tuberculosis (TB)
flu
chickenpox
Read more information on NHS vaccines for adults and children to find out whether you should have any."
Symptoms of trichomoniasis,"Symptoms of trichomoniasis usually develop within a month of infection.
But up to half of all people will not develop any symptoms (though they can still pass the infection on to others).
The symptoms of trichomoniasis are similar to those of many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so it can sometimes be difficult to diagnose.
Symptoms in women
Trichomoniasis in women can cause:
abnormal vaginal discharge that may be thick, thin or frothy and yellow-green in colour
producing more discharge than normal, which may also have an unpleasant fishy smell
soreness, swelling and itching around the vagina – sometimes the inner thighs also become itchy
pain or discomfort when passing urine or having sex
Symptoms in men
Trichomoniasis in men can cause:
pain when peeing or during ejaculation
needing to pee more frequently than usual
thin, white discharge from the penis
soreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis or foreskin"
When to get medical advice,"See a GP or go to your local sexual health clinic (sometimes called a GUM clinic) if you develop any of the symptoms of trichomoniasis or you think you may be infected.
Trichomoniasis can usually be diagnosed after an examination of the genitals and a laboratory test carried out on a swab taken from the vagina or penis.
If the test shows you have trichomoniasis, it's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent partners are also tested and treated."
How do you get trichomoniasis?,"Trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis.  
In women, this parasite mainly infects the vagina and the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).
In men, the infection most commonly affects the urethra, but the head of the penis or prostate gland – a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen – can become infected in some cases.
The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom.
It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use.
You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.
Trichomoniasis is not thought to be passed on through oral or anal sex.
You also cannot pass on trichomoniasis through:
kissing or hugging
sharing cups, plates or cutlery
toilet seats
The best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to have safe sex. This means always using a condom when having sex, covering any sex toys you use with a condom, and washing sex toys after use."
Treating trichomoniasis,"Trichomoniasis is unlikely to go away without treatment, but it can be effectively treated with antibiotics.
Most men and women are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is usually taken twice a day for 5 to 7 days.
It's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up to prevent reinfection.
Your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated."
Complications of trichomoniasis,"Complications of trichomoniasis are rare, although some women with the infection may be at an increased risk of further problems.
If you're infected with trichomoniasis while you're pregnant, the infection may cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birthweight."
Symptoms of trichotillomania,"People with trich feel an intense urge to pull their hair out and they experience growing tension until they do. After pulling their hair out, they feel a sense of relief.
A person may sometimes pull their hair out in response to a stressful situation, or it may be done without really thinking about it.
Most people with trich pull out hair from their scalp, but some pull out hair from other areas, such as their:
eyebrows
eyelashes
genital area
beard or moustache
Bald patches on the head may have an unusual shape and affect 1 side of the head more than the other.
Trich may cause feelings of shame and low self-esteem. Those affected may try to keep their condition to themselves."
Causes of trichotillomania,"It's not entirely clear what causes trich. It could be:
your way of dealing with stress or anxiety
a chemical imbalance in the brain
changes in hormone levels during puberty
genetic - more than one person in a family may have the condition
For some people, hair pulling can be a habit that's hard to break. The more they pull their hair out, the more they want to keep doing it."
When to see a GP,"See your GP if you're pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is.
You should also see your GP if you or your child has a habit of eating hair. This can cause hairballs to form in the stomach, leading to serious illness.
Your GP may examine areas where the hair is missing to check that nothing else is causing the hair to come out, such as a skin infection.
If your GP thinks you have trich, you may be referred for a type of treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
If you are under 18, this may be offered through your local children and young people's mental health services."
Treating trichotillomania,"Trich is commonly treated using a type of CBT called habit reversal training.
This aims to help you replace a bad habit with something that's not harmful. Treatment usually involves:
keeping a diary of your hair pulling
working out the triggers for your hair pulling and learning how to avoid them
replacing hair pulling with another action, like squeezing a stress ball
loved ones providing emotional support and encouragement
Antidepressants are not usually prescribed to treat trich."
Things you can try yourself,"Here are some tips from people with trich that may help when you feel the urge to pull your hair:
squeeze a stress ball or something similar
form a ball with your fist and tighten the muscles in that arm
use a fidget toy
wear a bandana or a tight-fitting hat, such as a beanie
take a soothing bath to ease any stress or anxiety
practise deep breathing until the urge to pull goes away
exercise
put plasters on your fingertips
cut your hair short"
Getting support,"It may also help to open up about your trich to people you trust, as hiding it can sometimes make your anxiety worse.
Many people who have learned to manage their trich say that speaking to others about the condition led to a reduction in hair pulling.
There is information on treatments and self-help advice on the OCD UK website."
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.
The GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.
However, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.
Read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia."
What causes trigeminal neuralgia?,"Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the nerve inside the skull that transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.
The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.
Trigeminal neuralgia can also happen when the trigeminal nerve is damaged by another medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.
The attacks of pain are usually brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind – even a slight breeze or air conditioning – or movement of the face or head. Sometimes the pain can happen without a trigger.
Read more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia."
Who's affected,"It's not clear how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but it's thought to be rare.
Trigeminal neuralgia affects more women than men, and it usually starts between the ages of 50 and 60. It's rare in adults younger than 40."
Treating trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, the treatments available do help most cases to some degree.
An anticonvulsant medicine called carbamazepine, which is often used to treat epilepsy, is the first treatment usually recommended to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine can relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.
Carbamazepine needs to be taken several times a day to be effective, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so high enough levels of the medicine can build up in your bloodstream.
Unless your pain becomes much better, or disappears, the medicine is usually continued for as long as necessary, which could be for many years.
If you're entering a period of remission, where your pain goes away, stopping carbamazepine should always be done slowly, over days or weeks, unless a doctor tells you otherwise.
If this medicine does not help you, causes too many side effects, or you're unable to take it, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medicines or surgical procedures that may help.
There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years.
Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open your skull and move any blood vessels that are compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results for long-term pain relief, but it's a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as hearing loss, facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke.
Read more about treating trigeminal neuralgia."
Post-herpetic neuralgia,Post-herpetic neuralgia is a more common type of nerve pain that usually develops in an area previously affected by shingles.
Symptoms of trigger finger,"Symptoms of trigger finger can include pain at the base of the affected finger or thumb when you move it or press on it, and stiffness or clicking when you move the affected finger or thumb, particularly first thing in the morning.
If the condition gets worse, you may have pain in your hand even when it's still. You might also get a lump in your palm and your finger may get stuck in a bent position and then suddenly pop straight. Eventually, it may not fully bend or straighten.
See your GP if you think you may have trigger finger. They'll examine your hand and advise you about appropriate treatments."
What causes trigger finger?,"Tendons are tough cords that join bone to muscle. They move the bone when the muscle contracts. In the hand, tendons run along the front and back of the bones in the fingers and are attached to the muscles in the forearm.
The tendons on the palm side of the hand (flexor tendons) are held in place by strong bands of tissue, known as ligaments, which are shaped in arches over the tendon. The tendons are covered by a protective sheath which produces a small amount of fluid to keep the tendons lubricated. This allows them to move freely and smoothly within the sheath when the fingers are bent and straightened.
Trigger finger occurs if there's a problem with the tendon or sheath, such as inflammation and swelling. If the tendon can no longer slide easily through the sheath it can bunch up to form a small lump (nodule). This makes bending the affected finger or thumb difficult. If the tendon gets caught in the sheath, the finger can click painfully as it's straightened.
The exact reason why these problems occur is not known, but several factors may increase the likelihood of trigger finger developing. For example, it's more common in women, people over 40 years old, and those with certain medical conditions.
Another hand-related condition called Dupuytren's contracture can also increase your risk of developing trigger finger. In Dupuytren's contracture, the connective tissue in the palm of the hand thickens, causing 1 or more fingers to bend into the palm of the hand.
Long-term conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, are also associated with trigger finger."
How trigger finger is treated,"In some people, trigger finger may get better without treatment.
However, if it is not treated, there's a chance the affected finger or thumb could become permanently bent, which will make performing everyday tasks difficult.
If treatment is necessary, several options are available, including:
rest – avoiding certain activities
medication – taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help relieve pain
splinting – where the affected finger is strapped to a plastic splint to reduce movement
steroid injection – steroids are medicines that can reduce swelling
surgery on the affected hand – surgery can allow the affected tendon to move freely again
Surgery is usually only used when other treatments have failed. It can be up to 100% effective, although if you do a manual job you may need to take 2 to 4 weeks off work to fully recover."
Trigger finger in children,"Trigger finger is uncommon in children but sometimes young children develop it. It can affect the child's ability to straighten their thumb, but it's rarely painful and usually gets better by age 3 without treatment."
Symptoms of trimethylaminuria,"Trimethylaminuria symptoms can be present from birth, but they may not start until later in life, often around puberty.
The only symptom is an unpleasant smell, typically of rotting fish – although it can be described as smelling like other things – that can affect the:
breath
sweat
pee
vaginal fluids
The smell may be constant or may come and go. Things that can make it worse include:
sweating
stress
certain foods – such as fish, eggs and beans
periods"
When to see a GP,"See a GP if you notice a strong, unpleasant smell that doesn't go away.
They can check for more common causes, such as body odour, gum disease, a urinary tract infection or bacterial vaginosis.
Tell your GP if you think it might be trimethylaminuria. It's an uncommon condition and they may not have heard of it.
They may refer you to a specialist for tests to check for the condition."
Causes of trimethylaminuria,"In trimethylaminuria, the body is unable to turn a strong-smelling chemical called trimethylamine – produced in the gut when bacteria break down certain foods – into a different chemical that doesn't smell.
This means trimethylamine builds up in the body and gets into bodily fluids like sweat.
In some cases, this is caused by a faulty gene a person has inherited from their parents."
How trimethylaminuria is inherited,"Many people with trimethylaminuria inherit a faulty version of a gene called FMO3 from both their parents. This means they have 2 copies of the faulty gene.
The parents themselves might only have 1 copy of the faulty gene. This is known as being a ""carrier"". They usually won't have symptoms, although some may have mild or temporary ones.
If you have trimethylaminuria, any children you have will be carriers of the faulty gene so are unlikely to have problems. There's only a risk they could be born with the condition if your partner is a carrier.
Genetic counselling may help you understand the risks of passing trimethylaminuria on to any children you have."
Treatments for trimethylaminuria,"There's currently no cure for trimethylaminuria, but some things might help with the smell.
Foods to avoid
It can help to avoid certain foods that make the smell worse, such as:
cows' milk
seafood and shellfish – freshwater fish is fine
eggs
beans
peanuts
liver and kidney
supplements containing lecithin
It's not a good idea to make any big changes to your diet on your own, particularly if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, or are breastfeeding.
Your specialist can refer you to a dietitian for advice. They'll help you make sure your diet still contains all the nutrients you need.
Other things you can do
It can also be helpful to:
avoid strenuous exercise – try gentle exercises that don't make you sweat as much
try to find ways to relax – stress can make your symptoms worse
wash your skin with slightly acidic soap or shampoo – look for products with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5
use anti-perspirant
wash your clothes frequently
Treatments from a doctor
Your doctor may recommend:
short courses of antibiotics – this can help reduce the amount of trimethylamine produced in your gut
taking certain supplements – such as charcoal or riboflavin (vitamin B2)"
Support,"Many people find living with trimethylaminuria difficult. Feelings of isolation, embarrassment and depression are common.
Tell your doctor if you're struggling to cope. They may recommend seeing a counsellor for emotional support."
What problems can tuberous sclerosis cause?,"The tumours caused by tuberous sclerosis can result in a range of associated health problems, including:
epilepsy – a condition that causes seizures (fits)
learning disabilities
hyperactivity
an autistic spectrum disorder
skin abnormalities – such as patches of light-coloured or thickened skin, or red acne-like spots on the face
the kidneys not working properly
breathing difficulties
a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus)
These problems can range from mild to severe, and it's possible to have only a few of these problems or a wide range. Members of the same family may be affected very differently by tuberous sclerosis. 
Read more about the features of tuberous sclerosis and diagnosing tuberous sclerosis."
What causes tuberous sclerosis?,"Tuberous sclerosis is caused by changes (mutations) in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These genes are involved in regulating cell growth, and the mutations lead to uncontrolled growth and multiple tumours throughout the body.
In around 3 in every 4 cases, the genetic fault occurs for no apparent reason in people without any other affected family members.
In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, the fault is passed on to a child by their parents. Only one parent needs to carry the faulty gene to pass it on, and a parent who has one of the faulty genes has a 1 in 2 chance of passing it on to each child they have.
The parent carrying the faulty gene will also have tuberous sclerosis, although sometimes it may be so mild they do not realise."
How tuberous sclerosis is treated,"There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, but there is a range of treatments for many of the problems caused by the condition.
For example:
epilepsy may be controlled with medicine or, in some cases, surgery
extra educational support can help children with learning disabilities
challenging behaviour and psychiatric problems – such as anxiety or depression – can be treated with behavioural interventions and medicine
brain tumours can be surgically removed or shrunk with medicine
the facial rash can be treated with laser therapy or medication applied to the skin
medicine can control symptoms caused by reduced kidney function and can help shrink kidney tumours
lung problems can be treated with medication
Research has found that a type of medicine known as an mTOR inhibitor, which interrupts the chemical reactions needed for tumours to grow, may be a useful treatment in the future.
People with tuberous sclerosis will also need to have regular tests to monitor the function of the organs that can be affected by the condition.
Read more about treating tuberous sclerosis."
Outlook,"The outlook for people with tuberous sclerosis can vary considerably.
Some people have few symptoms and the condition has little effect on their life, while others – particularly those with a faulty TSC2 gene or obvious problems from an early age – can have severe and potentially life-threatening problems that require lifelong care.
Many people will have a normal lifespan, although a number of life-threatening complications can develop. These include a loss of kidney function, a serious lung infection called bronchopneumonia and a severe type of epileptic seizure called status epilepticus.
People with tuberous sclerosis may also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as kidney cancer, but this is rare."
Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA),"The TSA provides information, advice and support to individuals and families affected by tuberous sclerosis.
You can visit the TSA website for more information and to access their online community. You can also contact the organisation's specialist advisers in your area."
Characteristics of Turner syndrome,"Females with Turner syndrome often have a wide range of symptoms and some distinctive characteristics. Almost all girls with Turner syndrome:
are shorter than average
have underdeveloped ovaries, resulting in a lack of monthly periods and infertility
As height and sexual development are the 2 main things affected, Turner syndrome may not be diagnosed until a girl fails to show sexual development associated with puberty, usually between the ages of 8 and 14 years.
Other characteristics of Turner syndrome can vary significantly between individuals.
Read more about the symptoms of Turner syndrome and how Turner syndrome is diagnosed."
Treating Turner syndrome,"There's no cure for Turner syndrome but many of the associated symptoms can be treated.
Girls and women with Turner syndrome will need to have their heart, kidneys and reproductive system checked regularly throughout their lives. However, it's usually possible to lead a relatively normal and healthy life.
Life expectancy is slightly reduced, but it can be improved with regular health checks to identify and treat potential problems at an early stage.
Read more about treating Turner syndrome."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you or your daughter has Turner syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you/your daughter on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat Turner syndrome. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Twitches are usually nothing to worry about,"Most people get twitches from time to time.
They're often linked to:
stress and anxiety
tiredness and exhaustion
drinking caffeine or alcohol
some medicines – check the side effects on the packet or leaflet
Twitches can affect any part of the body. Twitches in the eyes or legs are particularly common.
You may also have tingling or cramps (spasms) in the same area."
How you can help stop a twitch,"A twitch may come and go, but will normally stop in a few days or weeks.
There's not usually any treatment for it.
But there are some things you can do to help.
Do
get plenty of rest
try to find ways to relax
stretch and massage any muscles affected by cramps
try not to worry about it – a twitch is usually harmless and worrying can make it worse
Don’t
do not drink lots of caffeine, such as tea and coffee
do not drink lots of alcohol
do not stop taking a prescribed medicine without getting medical advice, even if you think it could be causing your twitch"
What happens at your GP appointment,"If your twitch does not go away, your GP may:
check for causes like stress or a medicine you're taking
ask you to come back if the twitch has not stopped in a few weeks
refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for tests to look for conditions that can cause a twitch"
Who's affected?,"Typhoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.
Worldwide, children are thought to be most at risk of developing typhoid fever. This may be because their immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) is still developing.
But children with typhoid fever tend to have milder symptoms than adults.
Typhoid fever is uncommon in the UK, with around 300 infections confirmed each year.
Most of these people became infected while visiting relatives in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. But you're also at risk if you visit Asia, Africa or South America."
Symptoms of typhoid fever,"The main symptoms of typhoid fever are:
a persistent high temperature that gradually increases each day
headache
general aches and pains
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
cough
constipation
As the infection progresses, you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and have a tummy ache and diarrhoea. Some people may develop a rash.
If typhoid fever isn't treated, the symptoms will continue to get worse over the following weeks and the risk of developing potentially fatal complications will increase.
Read more about the symptoms of typhoid fever and the complications of typhoid fever."
How typhoid fever is treated,"Typhoid fever requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.
If typhoid fever is diagnosed early, the infection is likely to be mild and can usually be treated at home with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotic tablets.
More severe typhoid fever usually requires admission to hospital so antibiotic injections can be given.
With prompt antibiotic treatment, most people will start to feel better within a few days and serious complications are very rare.
Deaths from typhoid fever are now virtually unheard of in the UK.
If typhoid fever isn't treated, it's estimated that up to 1 in 5 people with the condition will die.
Some of those who survive will have complications caused by the infection.
Read more about treating typhoid fever."
Typhoid fever vaccination,"In the UK, 2 vaccines are available that can provide some protection against typhoid fever.
These involve either having a single injection or taking 3 capsules over alternate days.
Vaccination is recommended for anyone planning to travel to parts of the world where typhoid fever is widespread.
The areas with the highest rates of typhoid fever are:
the Indian subcontinent
Africa
south and southeast Asia
South America
It’s important to get vaccinated against typhoid fever if you’re travelling to a high risk area because some strains of the typhoid bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics.
Vaccination is particularly important if you're planning to live or work closely with local people.
But as neither vaccine offers 100% protection, it's also important to follow some precautions when travelling. For example, you should only drink bottled or boiled water, and you should avoid foods that could potentially be contaminated.
Read more about the typhoid fever vaccination."
Travel advice,"When travelling to a foreign country, it's a good idea to make a list of relevant contact details and telephone numbers in case of an emergency.
You can get travel information and advice for different countries on:
Travel Health Pro: country information
GOV.UK: foreign travel advice"
How you get typhus,"You can catch typhus if you're bitten by infected lice, mites or fleas. These are often found on small animals like mice, rats, cats, dogs, and squirrels.
People can also carry them on their clothes, skin or hair.
Typhus is mainly found in parts of Africa, South America and Asia, especially in places where:
hygiene is poor
there are overcrowded living conditions
there are lots of bushes and grassland"
How to lower your risk of getting typhus when travelling,"There's no vaccine to prevent typhus, but you can reduce the risk of getting infected.
Do
use insect repellent that contains DEET
wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers
wash and shower regularly
wash and change your clothes regularly
Don’t
do not wear clothing or use bedding that might be infected with body lice"
Symptoms of typhus,"Symptoms of typhus include:
a high temperature
headache
a rash, which may be harder to see on black or brown skin
feeling sick or being sick
feeling generally unwell"
Treatment for typhus,"If a doctor thinks you could have typhus, they'll usually suggest a blood test or skin biopsy.
Antibiotics are used to treat a typhus infection. They're usually started before you get your test result, as this can take up to a week.
Most people start to feel better within 48 hours of starting treatment. It's important to keep taking your antibiotics until they're finished, even if you feel better.
People with severe typhus may need to be treated in hospital."
Symptoms of ulcerative colitis,"The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:
recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus
tummy pain
needing to poo frequently
You may also experience extreme tiredness (fatigue), loss of appetite and weight loss.
The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is.
For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives."
When to get medical advice,"You should see a GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you have not been diagnosed with the condition.
They can arrange blood or poo sample tests to help determine what may be causing your symptoms.
If necessary, they can refer you to hospital for further tests.
Find out more about diagnosing ulcerative colitis
If you have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and think you may be having a severe flare-up, contact a GP or your care team for advice.
You may need to be urgently admitted to hospital for immediate care.
If you cannot contact your GP or care team, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service."
What causes ulcerative colitis?,"Ulcerative colitis is thought to be an autoimmune condition.
This means the immune system, the body's defence against infection, goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue.
The most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon as a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon, causing it to become inflamed.
Exactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear.
Many experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors."
Who's affected,"The UK Crohn's & Colitis UK charity reports at least 1 in every 227 people in the UK has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. This amounts to around 296,000 people.
The condition can develop at any age, but is most often diagnosed in people between 15 and 25 years old.
It's more common in white people of European descent, especially those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish communities, and black people.
The condition is rarer in people from Asian backgrounds, although the reasons for this are unclear.
Both men and women seem to be equally affected by ulcerative colitis."
How ulcerative colitis is treated,"Treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve symptoms during a flare-up and prevent symptoms from returning (maintaining remission).
In most people, this is achieved by taking medicine, such as:
aminosalicylates (ASAs)
corticosteroids (steroid medicines)
immunosuppressants
Mild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. But more severe flare-ups need to be treated in hospital.
If medicines are not effective at controlling your symptoms or your quality of life is significantly affected by your condition, surgery to remove some or all of your bowel (colon) may be an option.
During surgery, your small intestine can be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen known as a stoma. This type of surgery is known as an ileostomy.
In some cases, the stoma is only temporary and can be closed up once your bowel has healed.
An alternative option is to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus called an ileoanal pouch.

Complications of ulcerative colitis,"Complications of ulcerative colitis include:
an increased risk of developing bowel cancer
poor growth and development in children and young people
Also, the steroid medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis can cause weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) as a side effect.

IBD or IBS?
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term mainly used to describe 2 conditions that cause inflammation of the gut (gastrointestinal tract).
They are:
ulcerative colitis
Crohn's disease
IBD should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a different condition and requires different treatment."
How ultrasound scans work,"A small device called an ultrasound probe is used, which gives off high-frequency sound waves.
You can't hear these sound waves, but when they bounce off different parts of the body, they create ""echoes"" that are picked up by the probe and turned into a moving image.
This image is displayed on a monitor while the scan is carried out."
Preparing for an ultrasound scan,"Before having some types of ultrasound scan, you may be asked to follow certain instructions to help improve the quality of the images produced.
For example, you may be advised to:
drink water and not go to the toilet until after the scan – this may be needed before a scan of your unborn baby or your pelvic area
avoid eating or drinking for several hours before the scan – this may be needed before a scan of your digestive system, including the liver and gallbladder
Depending on the area of your body being examined, the hospital may ask you to remove some clothing and wear a hospital gown.
If you need a sedative to help you relax, this will be given through a small tube into the back of your hand or into your arm.
In some cases, you may also be given an injection of a harmless substance called a contrast agent before the scan, as this can make the images clearer."
What happens during an ultrasound scan,"Most ultrasound scans last between 15 and 45 minutes. They usually take place in a hospital radiology department and are performed either by a doctor, radiographer or a sonographer.
They can also be carried out in community locations such as GP practices, and may be performed by other healthcare professionals, such as midwives or physiotherapists who have been specially trained in ultrasound.
There are different kinds of ultrasound scans, depending on which part of the body is being scanned and why.
The 3 main types are:
external ultrasound scan – the probe is moved over the skin
internal ultrasound scan – the probe is inserted into the body
endoscopic ultrasound scan – the probe is attached to a long, thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) and passed further into the body
These techniques are described below.
External ultrasound scan
Credit:
An external ultrasound scan is most often used to examine the heart or an unborn baby in the womb.
It can also be used to examine the liver, kidneys and other organs in the tummy and pelvis, as well as other organs or tissues that can be assessed through the skin, such as muscles and joints.
A small handheld probe is placed on your skin and moved over the part of your body being examined.
A lubricating gel is put on your skin to allow the probe to move smoothly. This also ensures there's continuous contact between the probe and the skin.
You shouldn't feel anything other than the sensor and gel on your skin (which is often cold).
If you're having a scan of your womb or pelvic area, you may have a full bladder that causes you a little discomfort.
There will be a toilet nearby to empty your bladder once the scan is complete.
Internal or transvaginal ultrasound scan
Credit:
An internal examination allows a doctor to look more closely inside the body at organs such as the prostate gland, ovaries or womb.
A ""transvaginal"" ultrasound means ""through the vagina"". During the procedure, you'll be asked to either lie on your back, or on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest.
A small ultrasound probe with a sterile cover, not much wider than a finger, is then gently passed into the vagina or rectum and images are transmitted to a monitor.
Internal examinations may cause some discomfort, but don't usually cause any pain and shouldn't take very long.
Endoscopic ultrasound scan
Credit:
During an endoscopic ultrasound scan, an endoscope is inserted into your body, usually through your mouth, to examine areas such as your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus).
You'll usually be asked to lie on your side as the endoscope is carefully pushed down towards your stomach.
The endoscope has a light and an ultrasound device on the end. Once it's been inserted into the body, sound waves are used to create images in the same way as an external ultrasound.
You'll usually be given a sedative to keep you calm and local anaesthetic spray to numb your throat, as an endoscopic ultrasound scan can be uncomfortable and may make you feel sick. 
You may also be given a mouth guard to keep your mouth open and protect your teeth, in case you bite the endoscope."
After an ultrasound scan,"In most cases, there are no after-effects and you can go home soon after the scan is finished.
If a sedative wasn't used, you can drive, eat, drink and return to your other normal activities straightaway.
If you had an endoscopic ultrasound and were given a sedative to help you relax, you'll usually be advised to stay in hospital for a few hours until the medication starts to wear off.
You'll need to arrange for someone to pick you up from the hospital and stay with you for the next 24 hours.
You shouldn't drive, drink alcohol or operate machinery during this time.
You may be told the results of your scan soon after it's been carried out, but in most cases the images will need to be analysed and a report will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the scan.
They'll discuss the results with you a few days later or at your next appointment, if one's been arranged."
Are there any risks or side effects?,"There are no known risks from the sound waves used in an ultrasound scan. Unlike some other scans, such as CT scans, ultrasound scans don't involve exposure to radiation.
External and internal ultrasound scans don't have any side effects and are generally painless, although you may experience some discomfort as the probe is pressed over your skin or inserted into your body.
If you're having an internal scan and are allergic to latex, it's important to let the sonographer or doctor carrying out the scan know this so they can use a latex-free probe cover.
Endoscopic ultrasounds can be a bit more uncomfortable and can cause temporary side effects, such as a sore throat or bloating.
There's also a small risk of more serious complications, such as internal bleeding."
When to see your GP,"Undescended testicles are usually detected during the newborn physical examination carried out soon after birth, or during a routine check-up at 6 to 8 weeks.
See your GP if at any point you notice that 1 or both of your child's testicles are not in the normal place within the scrotum.
Undescended testicles aren't painful and your child isn't at risk of any immediate health problems, but they should be monitored by a doctor in case treatment is needed later on."
What causes undescended testicles?,"During pregnancy, the testicles form inside a baby boy's tummy (abdomen) before slowly moving down into the scrotum about a month or 2 before birth.
It's not known exactly why some boys are born with undescended testicles. Most boys with the condition are otherwise completely healthy.
Being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) and having a low birth weight and a family history of undescended testicles may increase the chances of a boy being born with the condition."
Diagnosing undescended testicles,"Undescended testicles can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination.
This will determine whether the testicles can be felt near the scrotum (palpable) or if they can't be felt at all (impalpable).
This physical examination can sometimes be difficult, so your doctor may need to refer your child to a paediatric surgeon.
No further scans or tests are needed to locate the testicles if they can be felt by the doctor.
If they can't be felt, part of the initial surgical treatment may involve keyhole surgery (a diagnostic laparoscopy) to see if the testicles are inside the abdomen."
How undescended testicles are treated,"If the testicles haven't descended by 6 months, they're very unlikely to do so and treatment will usually be recommended.
This is because boys with untreated undescended testicles can have fertility problems (infertility) in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer.
Treatment will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum. This is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate.
Surgery is ideally carried out before 12 months of age. If undescended testicles are treated at an early age, the risk of fertility problems and testicular cancer can be reduced.
Read more about treating undescended testicles."
Retractile testicles,"In most boys, the testicles can move in and out of the scrotum at different times, usually changing position as a result of temperature changes or feelings of fear or excitement.
If the testicles move in and out of the scrotum and do not stay ascended, this is known as retractile testicles.
Retractile testicles in young boys aren't a cause for concern, as the affected testicles often settle permanently in the scrotum as they get older.
But they may need to be monitored during childhood because they sometimes don't descend naturally and treatment may be required.
See your GP if you notice that your child's testicles are not within the scrotum. Your GP can carry out an examination to determine whether your child's testicles are undescended or retractile."
Causes of unintentional weight loss,"Unintentional weight loss has many different causes.
It might be caused by a stressful event like a divorce, losing a job, or the death of a loved one. It can also be caused by malnutrition, a health condition or a combination of things.
Some causes of unintentional weight loss include:
mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
problems with digestion, such as coeliac disease or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
other health conditions, such as an overactive thyroid, type 2 diabetes or heart failure
Sometimes weight loss can be caused by cancer. It's important to get it checked if you're losing weight without trying."
Treatment for unintentional weight loss,"Treatment for unintentional weight loss depends on what's causing it.
A GP will ask about your health and may arrange some tests or scans.
Depending on the possible cause, they may:
advise you about things you can do to help, such as ways to reduce stress
recommend treatment for any condition that's causing you to lose weight
refer you to a specialist"
When urinary catheters are used,"A urinary catheter is usually used when people have difficulty peeing (urinating) naturally. It can also be used to empty the bladder before or after surgery and to help perform certain tests.
Specific reasons a urinary catheter may be used include:
to allow urine to drain if you have an obstruction in the tube that carries urine out of your bladder (urethra). For example, because of scarring or prostate enlargement
to allow you to urinate if you have bladder weakness or nerve damage that affects your ability to pee
to drain your bladder during childbirth if you have an epidural anaesthetic
to drain your bladder before, during or after some types of surgery
to deliver medicine directly into the bladder, such as during chemotherapy for bladder cancer
as a last resort treatment for urinary incontinence when other types of treatment have been unsuccessful
Depending on the type of catheter you have and why it's being used, the catheter may be removed after a few minutes, hours or days, or it may be needed for the long term."
Types of urinary catheter,"There are 2 main types of urinary catheter:
intermittent catheters – these are temporarily inserted into the bladder and removed once the bladder is empty
indwelling catheters – these remain in place for many days or weeks, and are held in position by an inflated balloon in the bladder
Many people prefer to use an indwelling catheter because it's more convenient and avoids the repeated insertions needed with intermittent catheters. However, indwelling catheters are more likely to cause problems such as infections.
Inserting either type of catheter can be uncomfortable, so anaesthetic gel may be used on the area to reduce any pain. You may also experience some discomfort while the catheter is in place, but most people with a long-term catheter get used to this over time.
Read more about the types of urinary catheter."
Looking after your catheter,"If you need a long-term urinary catheter, you'll be given detailed advice about looking after it before you leave hospital.
This will include advice about getting new catheter supplies, reducing the risk of complications such as infections, spotting signs of potential problems, and when you should get medical advice.
You should be able to live a relatively normal life with a urinary catheter. The catheter and bag can be concealed under clothes, and you should be able to do most everyday activities, including working, exercising, swimming and having sex.
Read more about living with a urinary catheter."
Risks and potential problems,"The main problems caused by urinary catheters are infections in the urethra, bladder or, less commonly, the kidneys. These types of infection are known as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and usually need to be treated with antibiotics.
You can get a UTI from using either a short-term or a long-term catheter. However, the longer a catheter is used, the greater the risk of infection. This is why it's important that catheters are inserted correctly, maintained properly, and only used for as long as necessary.
Catheters can also sometimes lead to other problems, such as bladder spasms (similar to stomach cramps), leakages, blockages, and damage to the urethra.
Read more about the risks of urinary catheterisation."
Check if it's a urinary tract infection (UTI),"Symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) may include:
pain or a burning sensation when peeing (dysuria)
needing to pee more often than usual
needing to pee more often than usual during the night (nocturia)
needing to pee suddenly or more urgently than usual
pee that looks cloudy
blood in your pee
lower tummy pain or pain in your back, just under the ribs
a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery
a very low temperature below 36C
Your pee may also be dark or smell. If this is your only symptom, it might be because you've not been drinking enough water.
Children
Children with UTIs may also:
have a high temperature – your child is feeling hotter than usual if you touch their neck, back or tummy
appear generally unwell – babies and young children may be irritable and not feed or eat properly
wet the bed or wet themselves
be sick
Older, frail people or people with a urinary catheter
In older, frail people who have problems with memory, learning and concentration (such as dementia), and people with a urinary catheter, symptoms of a UTI may also include:
changes in behaviour, such as acting agitated or confused (delirium)
wetting themselves (incontinence) that is worse than usual
new shivering or shaking (rigors)"
Treatment from a GP,"If a GP thinks you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI), they may do a urine test, although this is not always needed.
A GP may also:
offer self-care advice and recommend taking a painkiller
give you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics
give you a prescription for antibiotics, but suggest you wait for 48 hours before taking them in case your symptoms go away on their own
It's important to take all the medicine you're prescribed, even if you start to feel better.
Treatment for UTIs that keep coming back (recurrent UTIs)
If your UTI comes back after treatment, or you have 2 UTIs in 6 months, a GP may:
prescribe a different antibiotic or prescribe a low-dose antibiotic to take for up to 6 months
prescribe a vaginal cream containing oestrogen, if you have gone through the menopause
refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatments"
Things you can do yourself,"To help ease symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI):
take paracetamol up to 4 times a day to reduce pain and a high temperature
you can give children liquid paracetamol
rest and drink enough fluids so you pass pale urine regularly during the day
avoid having sex
Some people take cystitis sachets or cranberry drinks and products every day to prevent UTIs from happening, which may help. But there's no evidence they help ease symptoms or treat a UTI if the infection has already started.
A pharmacist can help with UTIs
You can ask a pharmacist about treatments for a UTI.
A pharmacist can:
offer advice on things that can help you get better
suggest the best painkiller to take
provide the same treatment as a GP, if it's suitable for you
tell you if you need to see a GP about your symptoms
Find a pharmacy"
Causes of urinary tract infections (UTIs),"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract.
The bacteria enter through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).
Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection.
Things that increase the risk of bacteria getting into the bladder include:
having sex
pregnancy
conditions that block the urinary tract – such as kidney stones
conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder – such as an  enlarged prostate in men and constipation in children
urinary catheters (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
having a weakened immune system – for example, people with diabetes or people having chemotherapy
not drinking enough fluids
not keeping the genital area clean and dry"
How to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs),"There are some things you can try to help prevent a urinary tract infection (UTI) happening or prevent it returning.
Do
wipe from front to back when you go to the toilet
keep the genital area clean and dry
drink plenty of fluids, particularly water – so that you regularly pee during the day and do not feel thirsty
wash the skin around the vagina with water before and after sex
pee as soon as possible after sex
promptly change nappies or incontinence pads if they're soiled
Don’t
do not use scented soap
do not hold your pee in if you feel the urge to go
do not rush when going for a pee – try to fully empty your bladder
do not wear tight synthetic underwear, such as nylon
do not drink lots of alcoholic drinks, as they may irritate your bladder
do not have lots of sugary food or drinks, as they may encourage bacteria to grow
do not use condoms or a diaphragm or cap with spermicidal lube on them – try non-spermicidal lube or a different type of contraception
Other ways to prevent some UTIs coming back
If you keep getting a bladder infection (cystitis), there's some evidence it may be helpful to take:
D-mannose – a sugar you can buy as a powder or tablets to take every day
cranberry products – available as juice, tablets or capsules to take every day
Speak to your doctor before taking any of these during pregnancy.
Be aware that D-mannose and cranberry products can contain a lot of sugar.
If you're taking warfarin, you should avoid cranberry products."
Symptoms of uveitis,"Symptoms of uveitis include:
eye pain – usually a dull ache in or around your eye, which may be worse when focusing
eye redness
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
blurred or cloudy vision
small shapes moving across your field of vision (floaters)
loss of the ability to see objects at the side of your field of vision (peripheral vision)
The symptoms can develop suddenly or gradually over a few days. One or both eyes may be affected by uveitis."
When to get medical advice,"Contact a GP as soon as possible if you have persistent eye pain or an unusual change in your vision, particularly if you've had previous episodes of uveitis.
The GP may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) who will examine your eye in more detail.
The specialist may suggest further tests if uveitis is diagnosed, including eye scans, X-rays and blood tests. It's important to establish the cause of uveitis because it will help determine what treatment is needed."
Treating uveitis,"Steroid medicine is the main treatment for uveitis. It can help reduce inflammation inside your eye.
Different types of steroid medicines are recommended, depending on the type of uveitis. For example:
eyedrops are often used for uveitis that affects the front of the eye
injections, tablets and capsules are usually used to treat uveitis that affects the middle and back of the eye
Additional treatment may also be needed. This might be eyedrops to relieve pain or in some cases, surgery.
Read more about treating uveitis."
What causes uveitis?,"Many cases of uveitis are linked to a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection). For unknown reasons, the immune system can become overactive in the eye.
Less often, uveitis can be caused by an infection or an eye injury, and it can also happen after eye surgery.
In some cases, a cause cannot be identified.
Read more about the causes of uveitis."
Types of uveitis,"There are different types of uveitis, depending on which part of the eye is affected:
uveitis at the front of the eye (anterior uveitis or iritis) – this can cause redness and pain and tends to start quickly. This is the most common type of uveitis, accounting for about 3 in 4 cases
uveitis in the middle of the eye (intermediate uveitis) – this can cause floaters and blurred vision
uveitis at the back of the eye (posterior uveitis) – this can cause vision problems
Uveitis can sometimes affect both the front and the back of the eye. This is known as panuveitis.
Uveitis can also be described according to how long it lasts. For example:
acute uveitis – uveitis that develops quickly and improves within 3 months
recurrent uveitis – where there are repeated episodes of inflammation separated by gaps of several months
chronic uveitis – where the inflammation lasts longer and returns within 3 months of stopping treatment"
How common is uveitis?,"Uveitis is rare, affecting around 2 to 5 people in every 10,000 in the UK each year. It's most common in people aged 20 to 59, but it can also sometimes affect children."
Complications of uveitis,"Uveitis can sometimes lead to further problems, particularly if it is not treated quickly and properly.
You're more likely to develop complications if:
you're over 60
you have long-term (chronic) uveitis
you have less common types of uveitis that affect the middle or back of the eye (intermediate or posterior uveitis)
Some of the more common complications of uveitis include:
glaucoma – where the optic nerve, which connects your eye to your brain, becomes damaged; it can lead to loss of vision if not found and treated early
cataracts – where changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent, resulting in cloudy or misty vision
cystoid macular oedema – swelling of the retina (the thin, light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye); it can affect some people with long-term or posterior uveitis
detached retina – when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients
posterior synechiae – inflammation that causes the iris to stick to the lens of the eye; it's more likely to happen if uveitis is not treated quickly"
Check if your vaginal discharge is normal,"Vaginal discharge is not usually anything to worry about if it:
does not have a strong or unpleasant smell
is clear or white
is thick and sticky
is slippery and wet
You can get vaginal discharge at any age.
The amount of discharge varies. You usually get heavier discharge during pregnancy, if you're sexually active or if you're using birth control. It's often slippery and wet for a few days between your periods (when you ovulate)."
When vaginal discharge can be a sign of an infection,"If your discharge changes – for example, in smell, colour or texture – it might be a sign of an infection. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
Possible causes
Discharge Possible cause
Smells fishy
Bacterial vaginosis
Thick and white, like cottage cheese
Thrush
Green, yellow or frothy
Trichomoniasis
With pelvic pain or bleeding
Chlamydia or gonorrhoea
With blisters or sores
Genital herpes"
Things you can do to help with vaginal discharge,"You cannot prevent vaginal discharge, but it's normal and usually nothing to worry about.
To help avoid irritation, soreness or dryness:
Do
wash the skin around your vagina gently using warm water and mild, non-perfumed soap
Don’t
do not use perfumed soaps or gels
do not use deodorants or scented hygiene wipes
do not wash inside your vagina (douche)"
Symptoms of vaginal dryness,"You may have vaginal dryness if you:
feel sore or itchy in and around your vagina
feel pain or discomfort during sex
need to pee more often than usual
keep getting urinary tract infections (UTIs)
These things may make you feel less like you want to have sex."
Causes of vaginal dryness,"You can get vaginal dryness if you:
go through the menopause
are breastfeeding
take contraceptive pills or antidepressants
have your womb removed (a hysterectomy)
have cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy
These things can cause a change in your hormone levels. This change can affect how much vaginal discharge or fluid you have.
You can also have vaginal dryness if you:
are not aroused during sex
use perfumed soaps, washes or douches in and around your vagina
have an underlying condition, such as diabetes or Sjögren's syndrome"
How to treat vaginal dryness yourself,"You can try these things before you see a GP. You can get most of them from a pharmacy without a prescription.
Do
use water-based lubricants before sex – put these in and around your vagina, on your partner's penis, on your partner's fingers, or on a sex toy if you're using one
use vaginal moisturisers for vaginal dryness – you can put these inside your vagina to keep it moist
use unperfumed soaps and washes around your vagina
try to enjoy more foreplay so you feel more aroused during sex
Don’t
do not use perfumed soaps, washes and any douches in and around your vagina
do not put creams or lotions like petroleum jelly inside your vagina as it can cause an infection
do not use moisturisers that are not for your vagina"
Check if you have vulvodynia,"Vulvodynia can affect women of all ages. Anyone with a vulva can have vulval pain.
There's usually no change to the way your vulva looks, but it may feel uncomfortable or painful.
The pain may feel like:
burning
throbbing
stabbing
soreness
The pain can also:
affect all or part of your vulva
be constant or come and go
start on its own or when your vulva is touched – for example, when inserting a tampon or having sex
affect other areas, such as the inside of your thighs, around your bottom (anus), or the area where pee leaves your body (urethra)
sometimes start when you have a poo
Vulvodynia can have a big impact on your life, affecting things like your sleep, concentration and sexual relationships.
Information:
Other causes of genital pain
Other conditions that can cause genital pain include vaginitis, vaginismus and some sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."
What happens at your GP appointment,"If you see a GP about vulval pain, they'll ask about your symptoms. They may also ask if you've had any skin conditions or infections in your vagina, or if having sex is painful.
They may ask if they can examine your vulva and vagina. A cotton bud is often used to gently touch your vulva to see which areas are painful.
A swab may be taken to help rule out other conditions that can cause vaginal soreness, such as an infection.
If the cause of your vulval pain cannot be found, you may be referred to a specialist for help managing the pain."
Treatments for vulvodynia,"The main aim of treatment for vulvodynia is to help manage the pain.
Vulvodynia is often treated by more than one specialist, including:
a gynaecologist
a physiotherapist
a psychologist
a pain specialist
A number of different treatments may be recommended under the guidance of these specialists.
Treatments for vulvodynia can include:
medicines – this may be a cream you rub on your vulva to numb the pain or tablets to treat nerve pain
pelvic floor exercises to help you control your vaginal muscles
gently widening your vagina using tampon-shaped objects (vaginal trainers)
psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or psychosexual therapy (therapy to help with sexual problems)
surgery to remove the painful part of your vulva – this may occasionally be offered if other treatments have not worked
No single treatment works for everyone, and you may need to try several treatments to find out what works best for you."
Things you can do to help with vulvodynia,"There are some things you can do to help reduce vulval pain and ensure good vaginal hygiene.
Do
wear loose, cotton underwear
try using pads instead of tampons during your period
try different positions when having sex and use lubricant
try to avoid stress – things like yoga and mindfulness can help you relax
Don’t
do not sit in the same position for long periods
do not clean inside your vagina (douching)
do not have hot baths (make sure the water is cool or lukewarm)
do not use scented products, such as soaps and deodorants, in or around your vagina – you can use an emollient (ask a GP or pharmacist for advice)"
Causes of vulvodynia,"The exact cause of vulvodynia is not known.
It may be related to a number of things including:
damage, irritation or over-sensitivity of the nerves in the vulva
previous vaginal infections
changes in levels of hormones, such as oestrogen
weak pelvic floor muscles"
What is vaginismus?,"Vaginismus is the body's automatic reaction to the fear of some or all types of vaginal penetration.
Whenever penetration is attempted, your vaginal muscles tighten up on their own.
You have no control over it.
Occasionally, you can get vaginismus even if you have previously enjoyed painless penetrative sex.
Vaginismus does not necessarily affect your ability to get aroused and enjoy other types of sexual contact.
Other things that can cause women pain during sex include:"
Treatment for vaginismus,"Treatment usually focuses on:
managing your feelings around penetration
exercises to gradually get you used to penetration
Treatments for vaginismus
Possible treatment What treatment covers
Psychosexual therapy A type of talking therapy that aims to help you understand and change your feelings about your body and sex
Relaxation techniques Mindfulness, breathing and gentle touching exercises to help you learn to relax the vaginal muscles
Pelvic floor exercises Squeezing and releasing exercises to gain control of the vaginal muscles
Sensate focus Exercises to help with your relaxation during sex and increase your sex drive (libido)
Vaginal trainers Tampon-shaped objects in different sizes to help you gradually get used to having something put into your vagina
Treatment is initially done under the guidance of specialised therapists. You'll then usually be expected to practise some of the exercises at home.
If you're in a relationship, you can choose to involve your partner.
Treatment usually works and you may see progress in a matter of weeks.
Important:
Surgery
Sometimes vaginismus is mistaken for a physical problem with your vagina, which can lead to needless surgery. Very few cases of vaginismus require surgery."
Causes of vaginismus,"The reasons for vaginismus are not always clear, but some things thought to cause it include:
fearing that your vagina is too small
a bad first sexual experience
an unpleasant medical examination
believing sex is shameful or wrong
a painful medical condition, like thrush"
Check if you have vaginitis,"Symptoms of vaginitis include:
an itchy or sore vagina
vaginal discharge that's a different colour, smell or thickness to usual
vaginal dryness
pain when peeing or having sex
light vaginal bleeding or spotting
sore, swollen or cracked skin around your vagina
You might not have all these symptoms."
Causes of vaginitis,"Vaginitis has lots of possible causes.
Your symptoms might give you an idea what's causing it. But do not self diagnose, get medical help if you're worried.
Common causes of vaginitis
Symptoms Possible cause
White and lumpy discharge (like cottage cheese), itching and soreness
Thrush
Yellow, green or smelly discharge, pain when peeing or having sex
A sexually transmitted infection like trichomoniasis or chlamydia
A dry, itchy vagina and pain when having sex
Hormone changes from the menopause, breastfeeding or some types of contraception
Itchy, sore patches around your vagina and on other parts of your body
A skin condition like eczema or lichen planus
Vaginitis can also be caused by irritation (for example, from soap), an injury to your vagina or something in your vagina (like a tampon)."
What happens at your appointment,"To find out what's causing your vaginitis, a doctor or nurse may:
ask about any sexual partners you have
look at the skin around your vagina
look inside your vagina (pelvic examination)
Having a pelvic examination
You'll be asked to remove your underwear and lie on your back.
The doctor or nurse will gently put a smooth, tube-shaped tool (speculum) into your vagina to hold it open so they can see inside.
A small cotton bud (swab) may be wiped inside your vagina to check for infections.
You can ask the doctor or nurse to stop at any point if you find it too uncomfortable."
Treatments for vaginitis from a doctor,"Treatment for vaginitis depends on the cause.
For example, you may need:
antifungal medicine for thrush
antibiotics for a sexually transmitted infection
vaginal moisturiser, lubricant or hormone treatment for menopause symptoms
steroid medicine for a skin condition"
Things you can do to help vaginitis,"There are things you can do to ease symptoms of vaginitis and reduce your chances of getting it again.
Do
wash around your vagina with water and dry thoroughly
wear loose, cotton underwear
use pads instead of tampons when you're on your period
use condoms and lubrication when having sex
Don’t
do not clean inside your vagina (douching)
do not have hot baths
do not use scented hygiene products in or around your vagina, such as soaps and deodorants"
When to see a GP,"If you have varicose veins and they do not cause you any discomfort, you may not need to visit a GP.
Varicose veins are rarely a serious condition and do not usually require treatment.
But speak to a GP if:
your varicose veins are causing you pain or discomfort
the skin over your veins is sore and irritated
the aching in your legs is causing irritation at night and disturbing your sleep
The GP can diagnose varicose veins based on these symptoms, although further tests may be carried out.
Read about diagnosing varicose veins."
Causes of varicose veins,"Varicose veins develop when the small valves inside the veins stop working properly.
In a healthy vein, blood flows smoothly to the heart. The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through.
If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose).
Certain things can increase your chances of developing varicose veins, such as:
being female
having a close family member with varicose veins
being older
being overweight
having a job that involves long periods of standing
being pregnant
other conditions
Read about the causes of varicose veins."
Treating varicose veins,"If treatment is necessary, your doctor may first recommend using compression stockings, taking regular exercise and elevating the affected area when resting.
If your varicose veins are still causing you pain or discomfort, or they cause complications, they can be treated in several ways.
The most common treatment options include:
endothermal ablation – where heat is used to seal affected veins
sclerotherapy – this uses special foam to close the veins
ligation and stripping – the affected veins are surgically removed
It's unlikely you'll receive treatment on the NHS for cosmetic reasons – you'll have to pay for cosmetic treatment privately.
If you do feel you require treatment, it might help if you print out treatment options for varicose veins to discuss with the GP.
Read about:
Treating varicose veins 
Complications of varicose veins"
Preventing varicose veins,"There's little evidence to suggest you can stop varicose veins getting worse or completely stop new ones developing.
But there are ways to ease symptoms of existing varicose veins, such as:
avoiding standing or sitting still for long periods and trying to move around every 30 minutes
taking regular breaks throughout the day, raising the legs on pillows while resting to ease discomfort
exercising regularly – this can improve circulation and help maintain a healthy weight"
Types of varicose veins,"There are several types of varicose veins, such as:
trunk varicose veins – these are near to the surface of the skin and are thick and knobbly; they're often long and can look unpleasant
reticular varicose veins – these are red and sometimes grouped close together in a network
telangiectasia varicose veins – also known as thread veins or spider veins, these are small clusters of blue or red veins that sometimes appear on your face or legs; they're harmless and, unlike trunk varicose veins, do not bulge underneath the surface of the skin"
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome),"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects adults around 38 to 54.

Check if it's vertigo,"Vertigo feels like you or everything around you is spinning – enough to affect your balance. It's more than just feeling dizzy.
A vertigo attack can last from a few seconds to hours. If you have severe vertigo, it can last for many days or months."
Things you can do to help ease vertigo,"There are things you can do to ease vertigo symptoms when they're happening, and to reduce how often it happens.
Do
lie still in a quiet, dark room to reduce the spinning feeling
move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities
sit down straight away when you feel dizzy
turn on the lights if you get up at night
use a walking stick if you're at risk of falling
sleep with your head slightly raised on 2 or more pillows
get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a while before standing up
try to relax – anxiety can make vertigo worse
Don’t
do not bend over to pick things up – squat to lower yourself instead
do not stretch your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf"
What happens at your appointment,"If you have vertigo, a GP will ask about your symptoms to try to find out what could be causing them.
A simple test that involves you moving quickly from a sitting to a lying position might be done to check your balance. This could bring on symptoms.
You might also be referred to a specialist for further tests."
Treatment for vertigo,"Most people with vertigo get better without treatment.
Treatment will depend on the cause. A GP might prescribe antibiotics if it's caused by an infection.
You could also be given exercises to do to try to correct your balance.
Antihistamines can sometimes help with vertigo symptoms."
What causes vertigo,"Inner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes of vertigo.
These include:
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where specific head movements cause vertigo
labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection caused by a cold or flu virus
vestibular neuritis – inflammation of the vestibular nerve
Ménière's disease – a rare inner ear condition, which sometimes involves ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or loss of hearing
Other things that can cause vertigo include:
migraine
some types of medicine – check the leaflet to see if it's listed as a side effect
Sometimes the cause is unknown."

Symptoms of vitiligo,"The areas of skin most commonly affected by vitiligo include:
mouth and eyes
fingers and wrists
armpits
groin
genitals
inside your mouth
It can also sometimes develop where there are hair roots, such as on your scalp. The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey.
Vitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white.
The edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation).
Vitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy.
The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin.
There's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent.
Types of vitiligo
There are 2 main types of vitiligo:
non-segmental vitiligo
segmental vitiligo
In rare cases, it's possible for vitiligo to affect your whole body. This is known as universal vitiligo.
Non-segmental vitiligo
Credit:
In non-segmental vitiligo (also called bilateral or generalised vitiligo), the symptoms often appear on both sides of your body as symmetrical white patches.
Symmetrical patches can appear on the:
backs of your hands
arms
skin around body openings, such as the eyes
knees
elbows
feet
Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type of vitiligo, affecting around 9 in 10 people with the condition.
Segmental vitiligo
Credit:
In segmental vitiligo (also known as unilateral or localised vitiligo), the white patches only affect one area of your body.
Segmental vitiligo is less common than non-segmental vitiligo, although it's more common in children. It usually starts earlier and affects around 3 in 10 children with vitiligo."
What causes vitiligo?,"Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.
In vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair.
Autoimmune conditions
Non-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition.
In autoimmune conditions, the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue.
If you have non-segmental vitiligo, your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin.
Vitiligo is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions.
Risk factors
You may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if:
other members of your family have it
there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions – for example, if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach)
you have another autoimmune condition
you have melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system)
you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo
Neurochemicals
Segmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.
Triggers
It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as:
stressful events, such as childbirth
skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response)
hormonal changes to the body, such as puberty
problems with the liver or kidneys
exposure to certain chemicals
Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it."
Diagnosing vitiligo,"A GP will be able to diagnose vitiligo after examining the affected areas of skin.
They may ask you if:
there's a history of vitiligo in your family
there's a history of other autoimmune conditions in your family
you've injured the affected areas of skin – for example, whether you've had sunburn or a severe rash there
you tan easily in the sun, or whether you burn
any areas of skin have got better without treatment, or whether they're getting worse
you think your vitiligo is triggered by something
you've tried any treatments already
A GP may also ask you about the spread of vitiligo and the impact it has on your life. For example, how much it affects your confidence and self-esteem, and whether it affects your job.
Wood's lamp
If available, the GP may use an ultraviolet (UV) lamp called a Wood's lamp to look at your skin in more detail. You'll need to be in a dark room and the lamp will be held 10 to 13cm away from your skin.
The patches of vitiligo will be easier to see under UV light, which will help the GP distinguish vitiligo from other skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor (where there's a loss of pigment due to a fungal infection).
Other autoimmune conditions
As non-segmental vitiligo is closely associated with other autoimmune conditions, you may be assessed to see whether you have any symptoms that could suggest an autoimmune condition, such as:
being tired and lacking energy, which may be a sign of Addison's disease
being thirsty and needing to urinate often, which may be a sign of diabetes
A blood test may also be needed to check how well your thyroid gland is working."
Treating vitiligo,"If vitiligo is severe or making you unhappy, you may want to consider treatment.
The white patches caused by vitiligo are usually permanent, although treatment options are available to reduce their appearance.
If the patches are relatively small, skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up.
Steroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment, however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin
If steroid creams do not work, phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used.
Although treatment may help restore colour to your skin, the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading.
Find out more about treating vitiligo."
Complications of vitiligo,"Vitiligo can sometimes cause other problems.
Because of a lack of melanin, your skin will be more vulnerable to the effects of the sun. Make sure you use a strong sunscreen to avoid sunburn.
Vitiligo may also be associated with eye problems, such as inflammation of the iris, inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis), and a partial loss of hearing (hypoacusis).
Problems with confidence and self-esteem are common in people with vitiligo, particularly if it affects areas of skin that are frequently exposed."
Help and support,"Support groups can provide help and advice and may be able to put you in contact with other people with vitiligo. A GP may suggest a group in your local area.
The charity The Vitiligo Society is also offers advice and support."
Causes of vomiting blood,"There are many possible causes of vomiting blood.
It's often a sign of bleeding somewhere in your food pipe (oesophagus), which runs from your mouth to your stomach.
Common causes of vomiting blood include:
gastritis
stomach ulcers
heart burn and acid reflux
alcohol-related liver disease
damage to your food pipe from being sick or coughing a lot
Less common causes include:
oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer
blood conditions, such as haemophilia
some medicines, including aspirin, anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen and anticoagulant medicines (blood thinning medicines)
poisoning
It's also possible to vomit blood that was swallowed. For example, from a nosebleed or a baby breastfeeding on a bleeding nipple."
Symptoms of von Willebrand disease,"The symptoms of VWD may start at any age. They can range from very mild and barely noticeable to frequent and severe.
The main symptoms are:
large bruises or bruising easily
frequent or long-lasting nosebleeds
bleeding gums
heavy or long-lasting bleeding from cuts
in women, heavy periods and bleeding during or after labour
heavy or long-lasting bleeding after a tooth removal or surgery
In some people, there's also a small risk of problems such as bleeding in the gut (causing bleeding from the bottom) and painful bleeds into joints and muscles."
When to get medical help,"See a GP if you have symptoms of VWD, especially if someone else in your family has it.
If the GP thinks you might have a bleeding problem, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for blood tests to check for conditions like VWD. Tell your doctor if you have a history of it in your family.
If you've already been diagnosed with VWD, contact your specialist if:
you keep getting bleeds
you've had a heavy bleed
you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy 
Go to A&E if you have very heavy bleeding or bleeding that does not stop."
Treatment and lifestyle advice for von Willebrand disease,"There's currently no cure for VWD, but it can usually be controlled with medicines and some simple lifestyle measures.
Treating and preventing bleeds
If you're bleeding, applying pressure to the wound (or pinching the soft part of your nose if you have a nosebleed) for a few minutes may be all you need to do.
Your doctor may also give you medicine to help stop bleeding when it happens.
There are 3 main medicines that can help stop bleeds:
desmopressin – available as a nasal spray or injection
tranexamic acid – available as tablets, a mouthwash or an injection
von Willebrand factor concentrate – available as an injection
These medicines can also be used before a procedure or operation to reduce the risk of bleeding. If you have severe VWD, you may need to take them regularly to help prevent serious bleeds.
If your doctor recommends medicine, talk to them about the best option for you and ask about the side effects of each medicine.
Treatments for heavy periods
If VWD causes you to have heavy periods, speak to your GP or specialist about treatments to help control the bleeding.
These include:
oral contraceptive pill
intrauterine system (IUS)
tranexamic acid tablets
desmopressin nasal spray
in severe cases, von Willebrand factor concentrate
Read more about treatments for heavy periods
General advice
If you have VWD, you should:
tell your surgeon or dentist about it if you're due to have a procedure or operation – you may need to take medicine to reduce the risk of bleeding before and afterwards
tell your doctor or nurse about your VWD if you need a vaccination – they can give the injection just under your skin to avoid painful bleeding in your muscles
avoid aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen unless your specialist advises you it's safe to use them, as these can make bleeding worse – use other medicines such as paracetamol instead
ask your specialist if there are any activities you need to avoid – you should be able to take part in most sports and activities, but it's best to check first"
Types of von Willebrand disease,"There are several types of VWD.
The main types are:
type 1 – the mildest and most common type. People with type 1 VWD have a reduced level of von Willebrand factor in their blood. Bleeding is mostly only a problem if you have surgery, injure yourself, or have a tooth removed.
type 2 – in people with this type of VWD, von Willebrand factor does not work properly. Bleeding tends to be more frequent and heavier than in type 1.
type 3 – the most severe and rarest type. People with type 3 VWD have very low levels of von Willebrand factor, or none at all. Bleeding from the mouth, nose and gut is common, and you can have joint and muscle bleeds after an injury.
These 3 types are all inherited.
There's also a rare type that is not inherited called ""acquired von Willebrand disease"". This can start at any age and is usually associated with other conditions that affect the blood, immune system or heart."
How von Willebrand disease is inherited,"VWD is often caused by a fault in the gene involved in the production of von Willebrand factor.
The type of VWD a person is born with mostly depends on whether they inherit copies of this faulty gene from 1 or both parents.
If a parent has a genetic fault that causes VWD – there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child having type 1 or type 2 VWD, and no chance of them having type 3 VWD.
If both parents have a fault in the VWD gene – there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child being a carrier like their parents and a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of them having type 3 VWD.
The chances of inheriting type 1 VWD can also be affected by other things, including blood group. People with blood group O are more often affected than people with blood group A or B.
This means it's not always easy to predict whether a child might inherit it from their parents.
Parents who are carriers of a faulty VWF gene may not have symptoms themselves.
Speak to your specialist if you have VWD and are thinking about having a baby. If you have a family history of VWD and think you might be affected, you should ideally have tests before you get pregnant."
Pregnancy and von Willebrand disease,"You can have children if you have VWD, even if it's severe. But there's a risk of:
your child being born with VWD
you having heavy bleeding during or after labour
Speak to your doctor about your options if you're planning to have a baby. They may suggest genetic testing to see if your baby is at risk of being born with VWD.
You can also have tests towards the end of your pregnancy to check the level of von Willebrand factor in your blood. Medicine to help prevent bleeding during labour will be offered if your level is low.
You'll probably be advised to give birth in a specialist hospital in case there are any problems. Most women can give birth either vaginally or by caesarean section. It's rare for babies with VWD to have any problems with bleeding during birth."
National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service,"If you have VWD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).
The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat VWD. You can opt out of the register at any time."
Symptoms of vulval cancer,"Symptoms of vulval cancer can include:
a persistent itch in the vulva
pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva
raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark
a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva
bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods
an open sore in the vulva
a burning pain when peeing
a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour
See a GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva.
While it's highly unlikely to be the result of cancer, these changes should be investigated."
What causes vulval cancer?,"The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors:
increasing age
vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) – where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous
persistent infection with certain versions of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus
smoking
You may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection."
How vulval cancer is treated,"The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.
Some people may also have radiotherapy, where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells, or chemotherapy, where medicine is used to kill cancer cells, or both.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you're not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it's not possible to remove it all."
Outlook,"The outlook for vulval cancer depends on things such as how far the cancer has spread, your age, and your general health.
Generally, the earlier the cancer is detected and the younger you are, the better the chances of treatment being successful.
Overall, around 7 in every 10 women diagnosed with vulval cancer will survive at least 5 years.
But even after successful treatment, the cancer can come back.
You'll need regular follow-up appointments so your doctor can check if this is happening."
Can vulval cancer be prevented?,"It's not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by:
practising safer sex – using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV
attending cervical screening appointments – cervical screening can detect HPV and precancerous conditions such as vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)
stopping smoking
The HPV vaccination may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer.
This is now offered to all girls and boys who are 12 to 13 years old as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme."
Check if you have a wart or verruca,"Warts feel firm and rough. They can appear on palms, knuckles, knees and fingers.
Credit:
Warts are usually skin coloured but may appear darker on black or brown skin.
Credit:
You can get verrucas on your feet. They have tiny black dots under the hard skin.
Credit:
Some warts are round, flat and can be yellow (plane warts). You can have many of them.
Credit:
Clusters of warts spread over an area of skin (mosaic warts) are common on feet and hands.
Credit:
Warts are not harmful, but some people find them itchy, painful or embarrassing. Verrucas are more likely to be painful – like standing on a needle.
You can treat warts if they bother you, keep coming back or are painful."
A pharmacist can help with warts and verrucas,"You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to treat warts and verrucas.
These treatments can take up to 3 months to complete, may irritate your skin and do not always work. You should not use these treatments on your face.
Your pharmacist can give you advice about the best treatment for you.
Find a pharmacy"
Treatments for warts and verrucas,"A GP may be able to freeze a wart or verruca so it falls off a few weeks later. Sometimes it takes a few sessions.
Check with the GP if the NHS pays for this treatment in your area.
If treatment has not worked or you have a wart on your face, the GP might refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).
If you have a large or very painful verruca, you may be referred to a foot specialist (podiatrist).
A podiatrist can provide a number of treatments including:
stronger medicines than you can get from a pharmacist
freezing the verruca using liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy)
surgery to remove the verruca using a scalpel or laser
You can also pay to see a podiatrist privately.
Find a podiatrist"
How to stop warts and verrucas spreading,"Warts and verrucas are caused by a virus. They can be spread to other people from contaminated surfaces or through close skin contact.
You're more likely to spread a wart or verruca if your skin is wet or damaged.
It can take months for a wart or verruca to appear after contact with the virus.
There are things you can do to help stop warts or verrucas spreading to other people.
Do
wash your hands after touching a wart or verruca
change your socks daily if you have a verruca
cover warts and verrucas with a plaster when swimming
take care not to cut a wart when shaving
Don’t
do not share towels, flannels, socks or shoes if you have a wart or verruca
do not bite your nails or suck fingers with warts on
do not walk barefoot in public places if you have a verruca
do not scratch or pick a wart"
Causes of watering eyes,"It's normal for your eyes to water in smoky environments or if you're outside in the cold or wind.
An eye injury or something in your eye, such as an eyelash or a piece of grit, can also make your eyes water.
Sometimes watering eyes can be caused by:
an allergy or infection (conjunctivitis)
blocked tear ducts (the small tubes that tears drain into)
your eyelid drooping away from the eye (ectropion) or other eyelid problems
dry eye syndrome – this can cause your eyes to produce too many tears
Bell's palsy – a temporary weakness to one side of the face
some medicines and cancer treatments
Babies often have watering eyes because their tear ducts are small. It usually gets better by the time they're 1 year old."
A pharmacist can help with watering eyes,"You can ask a pharmacist about:
what you can do to treat watering eyes yourself – such as cleaning and protecting your eyes
what you can buy to help – such as cleaning solutions, eyedrops or allergy medicines
if you need to see an optician or GP"
Treatment for watering eyes,"Treatment may not be needed if your watering eyes are not causing problems.
If treatment is needed, it will depend on what the cause is.
For example:
eyedrops can help if your eyes are dry
antibiotic eyedrops can help if you have an eye infection
medicines can help if you have an allergy
anything in your eye, like a piece of grit, can be removed
a small operation may be needed if you have a problem with your eyelids or you have blocked tear ducts
If the GP cannot find what's causing your eyes to water, they may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests."
Check if you have whiplash,"Whiplash most often happens after a traffic accident or a slip or fall.
Common symptoms of whiplash include:
neck pain 
neck stiffness and difficulty moving your head
headaches
pain and muscle spasms in the shoulders and arms
It can take several hours for the symptoms to start after you injure your neck."
Things you can do to treat whiplash,"There are some things you can do to treat whiplash.
Do
take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help with pain
try to continue doing everyday activities – it might hurt a little but it will speed up your recovery
Don’t
do not use a neck brace or collar to support your neck – this does not help
do not rest your neck for long periods of time"
Treatment for whiplash,"A GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller such as codeine for whiplash.
If your symptoms do not get any better after a few weeks, a GP may refer you:
to a physiotherapist
to a pain specialist
for psychological support
Physiotherapy from the NHS may not be available in your area and waiting times can be long. You can also get physiotherapy privately.
Find a physiotherapist service"
Check if you or your child has whooping cough,"The first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat (a high temperature is uncommon).
After about a week, you or your child:
will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night
may make a ""whoop"" sound – a gasp for breath between coughs (young babies and some adults may not ""whoop"")
may have difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants)
may bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit
may become very red in the face (more common in adults)
The cough may last for several weeks or months."
Whooping cough can be dangerous,"Babies under 6 months old with whooping cough have an increased chance of having problems such as:
dehydration
breathing difficulties
pneumonia
seizures (fits)
Whooping cough is less severe in older children and adults but coughing may cause problems including:
sore ribs
hernia
middle ear infections
pee leaking out when you cough (urinary incontinence)"
Treatment for whooping cough,"Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you've had the infection.
Hospital treatment is usually needed if you have severe whooping cough, or your baby is under 6 months old and has whooping cough.
If whooping cough is diagnosed within 3 weeks of the infection, you'll be given antibiotics to help stop it spreading to others. Antibiotics may not reduce symptoms.
If you've had whooping cough for more than 3 weeks, you're no longer contagious and do not need antibiotics.
Important
Keep taking the antibiotics until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. Stopping treatment too soon could lead to the infection coming back."
How to ease the symptoms of whooping cough,"There are some things you can do to help ease the symptoms of whooping cough.
Do
get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve discomfort
Don’t
do not give a child under 16 paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time – always check first with a GP or pharmacist
do not give aspirin to children under 16
do not take cough medicines – they're not suitable for young children and do not help with this type of cough"
How long whooping cough is contagious,"If you have whooping cough, you're contagious from about 6 days after the start of cold-like symptoms to 3 weeks after the coughing starts.
If you start antibiotics within 3 weeks of starting to cough, it will reduce the time you're contagious for.
Important
Stay off school, work or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after your symptoms started if you've not had antibiotics."
The whooping cough vaccine,"The whooping cough vaccine protects babies and children from getting whooping cough. That's why it's important to have all the routine NHS vaccinations.
The whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the:
6-in-1 vaccine – for babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks
4-in-1 pre-school booster – for children aged 3 years 4 months
If you're pregnant you should also have the whooping cough vaccine – ideally between 16 and 32 weeks."
When to see a dentist,"You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your wisdom teeth are causing severe pain. They'll check your teeth and advise you whether they need to be removed.
If your dentist thinks you may need to have your wisdom teeth removed, they'll usually carry out an X-ray of your mouth. This gives them a clearer view of the position of your teeth.
As with any teeth problems, it's important to see your dentist as soon as possible, rather than waiting for your regular dental check-up.
Find your local dentist"
Why are wisdom teeth removed?,"Your wisdom teeth don't usually need to be removed if they're impacted but aren't causing any problems. This is because there's no proven benefit of doing this and it carries the risk of complications.
Sometimes, wisdom teeth that have become impacted or haven't fully broken through the surface of the gum can cause dental problems. Food and bacteria can get trapped around the edge of the wisdom teeth, causing a build-up of plaque, which can lead to:
tooth decay (dental caries)
gum disease (also called gingivitis or periodontal disease)
pericoronitis – when plaque causes an infection of the soft tissue that surrounds the tooth
cellulitis – a bacterial infection in the cheek, tongue or throat
abscess – a collection of pus in your wisdom teeth or the surrounding tissue as a result of a bacterial infection
cysts and benign growths – very rarely, a wisdom tooth that hasn't cut through the gum develops a cyst (a fluid-filled swelling)
Many of these problems can be treated with antibiotics and antiseptic mouthwash.
Wisdom teeth removal is usually recommended when other treatments haven't worked."
How wisdom teeth are removed,"Your dentist may remove your wisdom teeth, or they may refer you to a specialist surgeon for hospital treatment.
Before the operation, the procedure will usually be explained to you and you may be asked to sign a consent form.
You'll usually be given a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area around the tooth. You'll feel some pressure just before the tooth is removed, as your dentist or oral surgeon needs to widen the tooth socket by rocking the tooth back and forth.
A small cut in the gum is sometimes necessary, and the tooth may need to be cut into smaller pieces before it's removed.
It takes anything from a few minutes to 20 minutes, or sometimes even longer, to remove a wisdom tooth. 
After your wisdom teeth have been removed, you may have swelling and discomfort, both inside and outside your mouth. Occasionally, some mild bruising is also visible. This is usually worse for the first 3 days, but it can last for up to 2 weeks.
Read more about how a wisdom tooth is removed and recovering from wisdom tooth removal."
Possible complications,"As with all surgery, there are risks associated with removing a wisdom tooth. These include infection or delayed healing, both of which are more likely if you smoke during your recovery.
Another possible complication is ""dry socket"", which is a dull, aching sensation in your gum or jaw, and sometimes a bad smell or taste coming from the empty tooth socket. Dry socket is more likely if you don't follow the after-care instructions given by your dentist.
There's also a small risk of nerve damage, which can cause a tingling or numb sensation in your tongue, lower lip, chin, teeth and gums. This is usually temporary, but in rare cases it can be permanent.
Read more about the possible complications of wisdom tooth removal."
Dental costs,"Dentists charge depending on the treatment required, unless you're under 18 or otherwise exempt from NHS charges.
If hospital treatment is required, it will be provided through the NHS free of charge.
Read more about dental costs."
Is it serious?,"It can be scary to be told that you have a problem with your heart, but WPW syndrome usually isn't serious.
Many people will have no symptoms or only experience occasional, mild episodes of their heart racing. With treatment, the condition can normally be completely cured. For some people, their condition settles down without needing treatment.
WPW syndrome can sometimes be life-threatening, particularly if it occurs alongside a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. But this is rare and treatment can eliminate this risk."
Symptoms of WPW syndrome,"If you have WPW syndrome, you may experience episodes where your heart suddenly starts racing, before stopping or slowing down abruptly. This rapid heart rate is called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
During an episode, you may experience symptoms such as:
a pounding or fluttering heartbeat (heart palpitations)
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
shortness of breath
chest pain
passing out (fainting)
These episodes can last for seconds, minutes or hours.
How often they occur varies from person to person. Some people may have episodes on a daily basis, while others may only experience them a few times a year.
They normally occur randomly, without any identifiable cause, but they can sometimes be triggered by strenuous exercise or drinking a lot of alcohol or caffeine."
When to seek medical advice,"See a GP if you keep getting a fast or noticeable heartbeat (palpitations). It's important to get it checked out in case it could be something serious.
Dial 999 for an ambulance if:
your heartbeat doesn't go back to normal in a few minutes
you have chest pain that lasts more than 15 minutes – you may also have pain in your arms, back or jaw
you have chest pain and other symptoms like feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), shortness of breath or sweating
someone passes out (faints) and doesn't regain consciousness
If you've been diagnosed with WPW syndrome and you experience an episode, first try the techniques you've been taught or take any medication you've been given.
Dial 999 or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if these measures don't stop the episode within a few minutes, or if someone you know has WPW syndrome and collapses or faints."
What causes WPW syndrome?,"When the heart beats, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals.
In WPW syndrome, there's an extra electrical connection in the heart, which allows electrical signals to bypass the usual route and form a short circuit. This means the signals travel round and round in a loop, causing episodes where the heart beats very fast.
The extra electrical connection is caused by a strand of heart muscle that grows while the unborn baby is developing in the womb.
It's not clear exactly why this happens. It just seems to occur randomly in some babies, although rare cases have been found to run in families."
Diagnosing WPW syndrome,"If your doctor thinks you might have WPW syndrome after assessing your symptoms, they'll probably recommend having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and will refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist).
An ECG is a test that records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. Small discs called electrodes are stuck onto your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine. The machine records the tiny electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.
If you have WPW syndrome, the ECG will record an unusual pattern that isn't usually present in people who don't have the condition.
To confirm the diagnosis, you may be asked to wear a small portable ECG recorder so your heart rhythm can be recorded during an episode. The recorder will trace your heart rate continuously over a few days, or when you switch it on at the start of an episode."
Treatments for WPW syndrome,"In many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with WPW syndrome are harmless, don't last long, and settle down on their own without treatment.
You may therefore not need any treatment if your symptoms are mild or occur very occasionally, although you should still have regular check-ups so your heart can be monitored.
If your cardiologist recommends treatment, there are a number of options available. You can have treatment to either stop episodes when they occur, or prevent them occurring in the future.
Stopping an episode
There are 3 main techniques and treatments that can help stop episodes as they occur. These are:
Vagal manoeuvres – techniques designed to stimulate the nerve that slows down the electrical signals in your heart. An example is the ""Valsalva manoeuvre"", where you hold your nose, close your mouth and exhale hard while straining as if you're on the toilet.
Medication – an injection of medicine such as adenosine can be given in hospital if vagal manoeuvres don't help. It can block the abnormal electrical signals in your heart.
Cardioversion – a type of electric shock therapy that jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm. This may be carried out in hospital if the above treatments don't work.
Preventing further episodes
Techniques and treatments that can help prevent episodes include:
Lifestyle changes – if your episodes are triggered by things such as strenuous exercise or alcohol, avoiding these may help. Your cardiologist can advise you about this.
Catheter ablation – this procedure is commonly used nowadays to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system. It's effective in around 95% of cases.
Medication – daily tablets of medication such as amiodarone can help prevent episodes by slowing down the electrical impulses in your heart."
How you can ease wrist pain yourself,"If you see a GP about pain in your wrist, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your wrist when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your wrist for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
keep your hands and wrists moving with gentle exercises to help ease pain and stiffness
take paracetamol to ease the pain
take off any jewellery if your hand looks swollen
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
wear a splint to support your wrist and ease pain, especially at night – you can get these at most pharmacies and supermarkets
think about using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
think about getting a soft pad to support your wrist when typing
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
A pharmacist can help with wrist pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
the best splint to support your wrist and ease pain – flexible rubber splints are available if you still need to use your wrist
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy"
Common causes of wrist pain,"Wrist pain is often caused by bruising or injuring your wrist.
Your symptoms might also give you an idea of what's causing the pain in your wrist.
Common causes of wrist pain.
Symptoms Possible cause
Pain, swelling and bruising, difficult to move wrist or grip anything Sprained wrist
Pain, swelling and stiffness at the base of the thumb (near the wrist) that lasts a long time, may be hard to move fingers and thumb, may have a lump Tendonitis (de Quervain's disease) or arthritis
Aching pain that's worse at night, tingling, numbness or pins and needles in the fingers, hand or arm, a weak thumb or difficulty gripping Carpal tunnel syndrome
Smooth lump on top of the wrist, may be painful Ganglion cyst
Sudden, sharp wrist pain, swelling, a popping or snapping sound during the injury Broken wrist"
How X-rays work,"X-rays are a type of radiation that can pass through the body. They can't be seen by the naked eye and you can't feel them.
As they pass through the body, the energy from X-rays is absorbed at different rates by different parts of the body. A detector on the other side of the body picks up the X-rays after they've passed through and turns them into an image.
Dense parts of your body that X-rays find it more difficult to pass through, such as bone, show up as clear white areas on the image. Softer parts that X-rays can pass through more easily, such as your heart and lungs, show up as darker areas."
When X-rays are used,"X-rays can be used to examine most areas of the body. They're mainly used to look at the bones and joints, although they're sometimes used to detect problems affecting soft tissue, such as internal organs.
Problems that may be detected during an X-ray include:
bone fractures and breaks
tooth problems, such as loose teeth and dental abscesses
scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine)
non-cancerous and cancerous bone tumours
lung problems, such as pneumonia and lung cancer
dysphagia (swallowing problems)
heart problems, such as heart failure
breast cancer
X-rays can also be used to guide doctors or surgeons during certain procedures. For example, during a coronary angioplasty – a procedure to widen narrowed arteries near the heart – X-rays can be used to help guide a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) along one of your arteries."
Preparing for an X-ray,"You don't usually need to do anything special to prepare for an X-ray. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand and can continue taking your usual medications.
However, you may need to stop taking certain medications and avoid eating and drinking for a few hours if you're having an X-ray that uses a contrast agent.
For all X-rays, you should let the hospital know if you're pregnant. X-rays aren't usually recommended if you're pregnant unless it's an emergency.
It's a good idea to wear loose comfortable clothes, as you may be able to wear these during the X-ray. Try to avoid wearing jewellery and clothes containing metal (such as zips), as these will need to be removed."
Having an X-ray,"During an X-ray, you'll usually be asked to lie on a table or stand against a flat surface so that the part of your body being examined can be positioned in the right place.
The X-ray machine, which looks like a tube containing a large light bulb, will be carefully aimed at the part of the body being examined by the radiographer. They will operate the machine from behind a screen or from the next room.
The X-ray will last for a fraction of a second. You won't feel anything while it's carried out.
While the X-ray is being taken, you'll need to keep still so the image produced isn't blurred. More than one X-ray may be taken from different angles to provide as much information as possible.
The procedure will usually only take a few minutes.
Contrast X-rays
In some cases, a substance called a contrast agent may be given before an X-ray is carried out. This can help show soft tissues more clearly on the X-ray.
Types of X-rays involving a contrast agent include:
barium swallow – a substance called barium is swallowed to help highlight the upper digestive system
barium enema – barium is passed into your bowel through your bottom
angiography – iodine is injected into a blood vessel to highlight the heart and blood vessels
intravenous urogram (IVU) – iodine is injected into a blood vessel to highlight the kidneys and bladder
These types of X-rays may need special preparation beforehand and will usually take longer to carry out. Your appointment letter will mention anything you need to do to prepare."
What happens after an X-ray,"You won't experience any after effects from a standard X-ray and will be able to go home shortly afterwards. You can return to your normal activities straight away.
You may have some temporary side effects from the contrast agent if one was used during your X-ray.
For example, barium can turn your poo a whitish colour for a few days and an injection given to relax your stomach before the X-ray may cause your eyesight to be blurry for a few hours. Some people develop a rash or feel sick after having an iodine injection.
The X-ray images will often need to be examined by a doctor called a radiologist before you're told the results. They may discuss their findings with you on the same day, or they may send a report to your GP or the doctor who requested the X-ray, who can discuss the results with you a few days later."
Are X-rays safe?,"People are often concerned about being exposed to radiation during an X-ray. However, the part of your body being examined will only be exposed to a low level of radiation for a fraction of a second.
Generally, the amount of radiation you're exposed to during an X-ray is the equivalent to between a few days and a few years of exposure to natural radiation from the environment.
Being exposed to X-rays does carry a risk of causing cancer many years or decades later, but this risk is thought to be very small.
For example, an X-ray of your chest, limbs or teeth is equivalent to a few days' worth of background radiation, and has less than a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of causing cancer. For more information, see GOV.UK: patient dose information.
The benefits and risks of having an X-ray will be weighed up before it's recommended. Talk to your doctor or radiographer about the potential risks beforehand, if you have any concerns."
Check if you're at risk of yellow fever,"You can get yellow fever if you're bitten by an infected mosquito. The mosquitoes that carry the yellow fever virus bite during the day.
Yellow fever is very common in certain parts of the world, including:
parts of sub-Saharan Africa (the area below the Sahara desert)
parts of South America, including Trinidad and Tobago
parts of Central America
Yellow fever is not found in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands."
How to lower your risk of yellow fever,"If you're travelling to an area where yellow fever is found, there are some things you can do to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Do
wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs, particularly during early morning and early evening
use insect repellent on your skin (ideally one that contains the ingredient DEET)
close windows and doors whenever possible, or use blinds or screens
sleep under a mosquito net treated with insecticide, including during the day
Yellow fever vaccination
The yellow fever vaccine is recommended if:
you're travelling to an area where yellow fever is found
you need a yellow fever certificate to prove you've been vaccinated
Some people at risk of yellow fever through their work should also get vaccinated.
The yellow fever vaccine is safe for most people who are 9 months old or over.
You have to pay for the yellow fever vaccine for travel, and you can only get it from registered yellow fever vaccination centres."
Symptoms of yellow fever,"Yellow fever symptoms usually start 3 to 6 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, but sometimes they can take longer to appear.
Some yellow fever symptoms are similar to flu, such as:
high temperature
headache
feeling or being sick
aches and pains
loss of appetite
feeling generally unwell
These symptoms often last 3 or 4 days. But a small number of people get more serious symptoms within 24 hours of feeling better.
More serious symptoms include:
yellowing of your skin and eyes (jaundice)
dark pee
stomach pain
bleeding from your eyes, nose, mouth or stomach – you may have blood in your vomit or poo
These more serious symptoms can be fatal."
Treatment for yellow fever,"There's no specific treatment for yellow fever.
Most people make a full recovery after 3 or 4 days.
Things you can do to help ease your symptoms include:
taking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, which can help lower your temperature and relieve muscle pain or backache
drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
If you have more serious symptoms of yellow fever, you'll need to go into hospital immediately to be treated."
Check if you're at risk of Zika virus,"Zika virus is usually caught by being bitten by an infected mosquito.
Very rarely, you can get the virus by having sex with someone who has it.
Zika virus is found in parts of:
South and Central America
the Caribbean
the Pacific islands
Africa
Asia
The type of mosquitoes that carry Zika virus are not found in the UK."
How to avoid Zika virus,"If you're travelling to an area where Zika virus is found, get advice from a GP, nurse, pharmacist or travel clinic before you go.
It's best to do this at least 4 to 6 weeks before you travel, but you can still get advice at the last minute if you need to.
There are things you can do to avoid getting Zika virus while you're travelling.
Do
use insect repellent on your skin – make sure it's 50% DEET-based
sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticide
wear loose clothing that covers your arms and legs – the mosquitoes that carry Zika virus are most active during the day"
Symptoms of Zika virus,"Most people have few or no symptoms if they get Zika virus.
If you do have symptoms, they're usually mild and last around 2 to 7 days.
The most common symptoms include:
a high temperature
a headache
sore, red eyes
swollen joints and joint and muscle pain
a rash and itching all over the body"
Treatments for Zika virus,"There are no specific treatments for Zika virus.
If you have symptoms, you should:
get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids
take pain relief, such as paracetamol
If you're pregnant and have Zika virus, your midwife or hospital doctor will talk about the risk with you and may arrange an ultrasound scan to check your baby's growth.
You may also be referred to a specialist for more monitoring."
Complications of Zika virus,"Zika virus can harm a developing baby if you get it when you're pregnant.
It can cause problems with the baby's brain and the baby having an unusually small head (microcephaly).
You can have Zika virus without having any symptoms. This is why it's important to avoid getting pregnant for up to 3 months after you've come back to the UK from a country where there's a Zika virus risk.
Speak to your midwife or doctor for advice if you're worried your unborn baby may be affected by Zika virus.
Rarely, Zika virus can also cause Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a serious condition that affects the nervous system."
